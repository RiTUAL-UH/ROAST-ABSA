friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner , given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures , and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were , which we found to be most helpful . The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast ( buffet ) , it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers . A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found , also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby , making the hotel very central but not noisey . We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible . A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam .####[['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'treated in a very friendly manner'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'most helpful'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['breakfast ( buffet ', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'lovely'], ['on line', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['library', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'very central'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'not noisey'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'stay as carefree and pleasant as possible'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'big thankyou']]
Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause . We were not sure what to expect .

Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October , our second stay there , and it was lovely . If possible , ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias . We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain , the cathedrals and the hillsides around town . The restaurant , Mark ' s , is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island . The hotel is a little worn in places and the breakfast was not much to be desired , but otherwise a great place to stay .####[['Melia', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great views of the square'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'negative', 'not much to be desired'], ['Melia', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'little worn in places'], ['Melia', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great place to stay']]

Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English . I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine .

ute hotel , but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station , the Accademia and the Duomo , however the noise at night was unbearable ! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street , so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel . But if you plan to stay here , make sure you request a room in the back , away from the street ( there are many ) .

The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever ! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough , but no , they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites .

Fabulous , and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel . Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city .

Simply Fine , Incredible Value Almost everything was just right . Small hotel , front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL , elevators work well , bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily , microwave oven and small ' fridge handy , and supremely knowledgable concierge . Overall , incredible value for NYC . Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad , although going south on 8th is very down - scale ( but feels safe - - lots of police blending in everywhere - - never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians ) . . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise , even though room faced the street ( on 15th floor may have helped - - that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling . )####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Simply Fine'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Incredible Value'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'just right'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'Small'], ['front desk and bell staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'unobtrusive'], ['front desk and bell staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'HELPFUL'], ['elevators', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'well'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'bed very comfortable'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'well supplied'], ['front desk and bell staff', 'service general', 'positive', '4 glasses changed daily '], ['microwave oven', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'handy'], ['fridge', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'handy'], ['concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'supremely knowledgable'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'incredible value'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'theater district and restaurant row - not bad'], ['Location', 'location general', 'negative', 'going south on 8th is very down - scale'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'feels safe'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'never bothered us with noise'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'bright and airy feeling']]

Wow , what a great little hotel .

We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation .

at the monge again Exactly half a year after our first stay in the Hotel Monge we stayed here again for 4 nights . After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed . But no ; we enjoyed the time there as much as before . The room was extremely clean , enough space for 3 people , the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food , going for walks ( Jardin de plantes ! ) or simply wathcing people . So I still highly recommend this Hotel for people who don麓t want to spend too much money but want to have a nice , clean and friendly stay in a lovely area of Paris !####[['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'extremely clean'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'enough space'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'simply perfect'], ['Hotel Monge', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'still highly recommend'], ['Hotel Monge', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'don麓t want to spend too much money'], ['Hotel Monge', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['Hotel Monge', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Hotel Monge', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'friendly stay']]

Supportive Familiy - like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina . During such a scarey time , the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible . . . . not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit . Our safety was their highest priority , however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days .

The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona . We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris , so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury .

Pure Quality , if you don ' t mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week . Had a great room overlooking the church ( 17th floor ) . I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal , service was good and the bar area was impressive . This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside , but you do pay for it - ( my room rate was of around $ 600 a night ) . Overall very happy with the hotel , though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $ 27 .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'ideal'], ['hotel', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'Pure Quality'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'good'], ['bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'area was impressive'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'quite stunning inside'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'negative', 'rate was of around $ 600 a night'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very happy'], ['towels', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'seem a little excessive'], ['towels', 'room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['cornflakes', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'had to laugh']]

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights ' stay at the NY Palace , I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC . My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality , the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated , with a beautiful view of St . Patrick Cathedral on top of those , the use of the lounge was a great boon for us , supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant , friendly and civilized surroundings , the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not - so - friendly city as New York . Also , unlike what was written in a previous preview , we were there with our five yrs old child ( having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level ) and he was always made to feel at home ( I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there ) . I will definitely return to the Palace .####[['concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality'], ['concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'beautiful view of St .

Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter , picking the location for it ' s convenience for the airport for a flight the next day . Rooms are small and functional , bathroom ' unit ' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed . Bedding was a little strange , with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers .

Great location , not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size . I reserved directly with the hostel by email ( in Spanish ) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going , specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square . However , we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal , overlooking the road that was being dug up . Although they said the next day we could move rooms , they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning , which was rather annoying . Overall , it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'not so great'], ['hostal', 'location general', 'positive', 'very centrally located'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'neutral', 'vary a lot in size'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'annoying'], ['hostal', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'good value'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'made it worthwhile']]

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big , new hotel . When you step in to the lobby of the hotel , it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s .

great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay , excellent choice , everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great , rooms little small but never in em only to sleep . Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive , find the cava bar by the port side street , cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down .

fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor , and yet again have not been let down . This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona , the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel , to when you leave . We had a standard room for four nights , and it was just what we needed , I understand that there are better rooms , but this was above what you normally get in this price range . There was plenty of space , the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy , Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas , but when its cold and wet , we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway .

Horrendous customer service Overall , stay was just okay , but was tainted by management ' s unwillingness to honor their own quoted / written and confirmed total cost .

For this alone , would never recommend or stay there again , and we do intend to visit San Juan again . Conceptually , hotel was great architectural idea .

mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York . We found the hotel very comfortable , with a huge suite including a living area , large bed , decent bathroom and usable kitchen . Compared to similar priced hotels in New York , it earns its above average rating .

Great Deal Had a nice stay here . Staff was cordial . Modern decor in the East Tower was fine . Could see that mildew beginning to build up on the bath tiles will contribute to poor maintenance .

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you ' re driving a car . The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address ; according to the GPS in our rented car , the address did not even exist . It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport ( if one doesn ' t take a shuttle ) , and consequently we almost missed our plane . We arrived late to check - in at the hotel ( just before midnight ) , yet our room STILL was not ready for us . We certainly do not recommend this hotel .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Poor experience'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Avoid booking'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'extremely difficult to find'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'likewise nearly impossible to find our way'], ['NULL', 'service general', 'negative', 'room STILL was not ready'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'certainly do not recommend']]

Not bad but could be better , even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations - - really quite nice , but the room itself was fairly spartan . It did have a little sitting area , with two chairs and a table , but the beds were rock hard ( you want to ease down on them gently , lest you break a body part ) . The air conditioning was non - operative during our very warm stay in early - mid May ( the screenless window opened , however ) , the TV remote control did not work , although there was an attempt to repair it , and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced - - and was , with one that smelled somewhat less musty . On the positive side , the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful , the public areas and the rooms were immaculate , the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient , if not particularly appealing . 聽聽####[['NULL', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'Not bad but could be better'], ['bathrooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'most luxurious part'], ['bathrooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'really quite nice'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'fairly spartan'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'little sitting area'], ['two chairs and a table', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'beds were rock hard'], ['air conditioning', 'room_amenities quality', 'negative', 'non - operative'], ['TV', 'room_amenities quality', 'negative', 'remote control did not work'], ['blanket', 'room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative', 'smelled so musty'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely nice'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'immaculate'], ['NULL', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'immaculate'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'reasonable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient']]
Nice , Basic Hotel with Great Location This is a basic little place , nothing too flashy . We splurged a little on a superior double room , and had a good - sized room with a balcony overlooking the plaza in front .

The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc .

Yawn , it ' s another Hilton It ' s a Hilton . If you ' ve stayed in one before , you know what you ' re going to get .

Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge - but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[['Sofitel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'little small'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'spotless'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'smaller bedrooms'], ['bathrooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'more than make up'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'attention to detail is great'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'late check out at short notice and for no extra charge'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', '2 mins from Times square'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'nearly all the main sites are within working distance']]

Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms , so we decided to try this ( based on reviews from TripAdvisor , of course ) . Upon arriving at the airport ( Narita ) , we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there , right across the street from the hotel . Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo , but that ' s a 5 minute train ride , with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3 ~ 5 . About the hotel it is huge , with many options for food and entertainment , I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses . Depending on which tower you stay in ( Main Tower was great ) , the rooms are new , but a bit small , with everything needed in a hotel , including a small fridge ( bring your snacks and water ) . Very clean , nothing to say about that , except that some floors smelled like cigarretts . Internet is paid ( about US $ 10 . 00 ) and it is wired , so bring your wireless router ( Apple makes a great pocket - sized one ) . There ' s a convenience store downstairs , that over charges everything , but when needed it ' s there .####[['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'huge'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Main Tower was great'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'new'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small'], ['fridge', 'room_amenities design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'Very clean'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'negative', 'some floors smelled like cigarretts'], ['Internet', 'room_amenities prices', 'negative', 'paid ( about US $ 10 . 00 '], ['convenience store', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'over charges everything']]

We enjoyed the above - par service , the clean and cozy room ( yes , a little tight but workable ) , the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24 / 7 , and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere - - all at a very reasonable price . Best of all , the hotel is totally non smoking ! !

great location , great price for NYC This hotel was 1 block from restaurant row  2 blocks from the theater district plus it averaged $ 159 per night . A continental breakfast was also included at that price . No other place I found could even come close .

Great affordable place to stay I stayed for two nights last weekend and had a perfectly enjoybale stay . I knew not to expect the Ritz , I did get a clean , comfy bed , a shower and sink with plenty of hot water and good water pressure , and a nice flat screen TV with cable . I was on my own and was out most of the time exploring NYC , but I had a very nice room to come home to . The room was quiet and the lock on the door was very sturdy . I felt very safe and will stay here again when I comeback to NYC , especially if I am traveling solo .####[['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['NULL', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'affordable'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'perfectly enjoybale stay'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfy bed'], ['room', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'shower and sink with plenty of hot water'], ['room', 'room_amenities quality', 'positive', 'good water pressure'], ['flat screen TV with cable', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'quiet'], ['lock on the door', 'room_amenities quality', 'positive', 'very sturdy'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very safe'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'stay here again']]
Stylish , friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it . The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera , ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district . Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet , everything was superband included in the price . Drinks at the bar were expensive though .

Be wary ! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc . However , I found there was some rather foul stains ( females staying along do not make marks like that ) on the duvet cover , which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc . Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting .

Loved it ! Hotel 1898 exceeded our expectations and we cannot wait to go back next year . Superb decor , very clean and comfortable . The staff were very friendly and helpful .

Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5 , 2005 . It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10 : 20 p . m . on the night of Saturday 2nd . It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night . I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me . I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night .

A nice , affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona , but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price . Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord , you can ' t stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona ' s top sights . Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street . Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room , and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early ( 9 : 30ish ) in the morning . Otherwise , this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city .####[['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'affordable'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'good price'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'wonderful home base for seeing the city'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'nice size'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'balcony that overlooked a quiet street'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'hear the noise in the hallway'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely a great choice'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'saving a few Euros']]
A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $ 34 dollars a day . I may have been ok with this had I known , but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website .

Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii . It was definitely impressive , though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare . Still , it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos . My hotel room had what I ' d call a partial ocean view , you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view . I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was , even on the 26th floor , I heard even car horn , every screaming baby , every yelling partier on the street , all night long .####[['Oceanarium', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Loved'], ['Oceanarium', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely impressive'], ['lunch menu', 'food_drinks style_options', 'negative', 'shares space with it was pretty spare'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'just to take photos'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'neutral', 'partial ocean view'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'noisy the street below me was']]

Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days . The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all , it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem .

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July ; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years . An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff . Great location in Midtown on the East Side , close to restaurants , shopping and an easy walk , cab or subway ride to museums .

Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest . Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty . Hair in sink and bath was off putting . Best measure of ( lack of ) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window .

Great hotel , but not so great location The hotel is very modern , with an air of trendiness , the furniture is new and very nice , the bathroom is large , well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny . On the other hand , some things are a little kitchy , like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room ( first I thought it ' s parquet ) , the breakfast is really poor , the parking a little too expensive ( 15 euros a day ) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying . The hotel is near the train station , but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room . Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls . It takes about 15 minutes to the center .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'not so great'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'very modern'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'air of trendiness'], ['furniture', 'room_amenities design_features', 'positive', 'new'], ['furniture', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'well equiped'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'entire place is clean'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'shiny'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'little kitchy'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'really poor'], ['parking', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'little too expensive'], ['bathroom', 'room_amenities design_features', 'negative', 'glass door from the bathroom annoying'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'near the train station'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'can hear everything through the walls'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'takes about 15 minutes to the center']]
Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A ' dam . A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station . We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean , attractive and had an great bathroom . The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little ( not mid - forties with beard ) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room ( free tea / coffee / chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free ) Only minor points but will be staying there again in September . Try the DutchFlyer website ( Stena lines ) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing .

Excellent service . We stayed for 5 days during Christmas vacation , 2005 . There were 6 of us ; 2 seniors , 2 adults and 2 children , and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay there . While the building is older , worn , and was never fancy to begin with ; the rooms are big , comfortable , and in a perfect location . The service we received from the entire staff was very friendly and the best customer service any of us had ever experienced . I told the staff that I would post a positive review here and on cruise critic as a way of saying thank you .####[['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'thoroughly enjoyed our stay'], ['NULL', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'building is older'], ['NULL', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'worn'], ['NULL', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'never fancy'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'big'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'entire staff was very friendly']]

A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol . True - - but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels ' and it ' s a 20 euro cab ride . My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties - - a reservation canceled without notice , a free wifi system that was down ( a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords ) , a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks . This hotel is in a suburban business district - - it may be very convenient and useful on workdays ; my very short stay there , on a Saturday , after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip , was nothing but a series of frustrations .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '10 minutes away from Schiphol .

Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24 / 7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino , but the rooms themselves are a little tired .

Beds were clean and comfy , and the lounge room was roomy . The hotel is starting to show its age though , and the standard prices are several times what they should be .

Decent deal , decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean , has a modern Asian feel in the decour , and a decent breakfast to start you on your way . The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge . Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring . This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn ' t seem to know where it was .

They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable , pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location , nice doormen , and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we ' d stay again -####[['Kimberly', 'service general', 'positive', 'upgraded to a 3 bedr suite'], ['Kimberly', 'service general', 'positive', 'how nice'], ['bedr', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'no living room and no full kitchen'], ['NULL', 'service general', 'positive', 'moved us to 2 one bedr suites'], ['2 bedr', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'beds were comfortable'], ['sofa', 'room_amenities comfort', 'negative', 'not comfortable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'good'], ['doormen', 'service general', 'positive', 'nice']]

Nice location on clarke quay Hotel rooms were clean . Was given a room that could accommodate 2 adults and 3 children which was 2 double beds and a rollaway which was great .

Restaurants at the hotel are a little pricey but that is normal for Singapore .

Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris , I was concerned to choose well . After reading several reviews on the internet , I selected the Hotel D ' Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice . The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was ' at the heart ' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme , Louvre , Pompidou Centre , Pantheon etc . The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright , clean , and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate . All in all , the Hotel D ' Albe surpassed all our expectations , and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit .

Great hotel , good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence , approx 5 mins walk and about 10 - 15 mins to main city centre . We were pleasantly surprised by our room , the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious . Bathroom was clean . Breakfast was ok - we didn ' t bother getting up for it after the first morning ! There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by .

Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam . We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer . The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden , which was perfectly nice and quiet . Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East , for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional , something you don ' t see everywhere . Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well ( which we didnt join since we had other plans ) . Staff , especially porters and concierge , were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans , which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay . All in all , the location can ' t be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff , Pulitzer gets a thumb up !####[['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'overlooking the inner garden'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'perfectly nice'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'quiet'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'good size'], ['room', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'very ell apointed'], ['room', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'functional'], ['porters', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely helpful'], ['concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely helpful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', "can ' t be beaten"], ['Pulitzer', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'uniqueness of the architecture'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['Pulitzer', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'thumb up']]

Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont . We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite , we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money , the rooms are huge . We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river . I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had , however , on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill .

Not at all what is used to be This once was a nice hotel which has gone for the cheapercrowd , tatoo people , Mom Dad 3 kids in a room type deal + events . Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings . This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences , cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd , and weddings anyday of the week which means : bottom line the facilities are not available 24 / 7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard .

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september . Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF , we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel .

Loved the valentine special offerings I normally do not stay in Dutch hotels as my job puts me up in enough hotels abroad . However my boyfriend treated me to a valentine weekend in Amsterdam .

Lovely place to stay Lovely place to stay . After reading the reviews on tripadvisor , my girl - friend and I decided to go for this hotel . The staff were very helpful with everything our hearts desired ( calling a cab , giving us directions , carrying our bags up to the room and down again when we left ) , the breakfast was a treat , the rooms were very romantic and clean and the location was superb .

Great location and friendly hotel I chose this hotel mainly due to location as I was taking my Mum who can ' t walk so far - but it was a great choice alround . We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful . Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view .

Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews . The hotel is clean , comfortable and the staff are excellent .

in the center of it all . . . The main attraction to this hotel is location / price . . . you are next to three of the main subway lines in Tokyo and can walk to many great restaurants and attractions .

Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January , 2006 . We arrived a full 39 hours late , due to snow in Tokyo , but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren ' t there .

average at best This hotel has a good location , but not a lot else , it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room , including giving us the key to an occupied room , and keys that did not work . We were then allegedly upgraded , from what I cannot imagine , the room was tiny , and not air conditioned . The continental breakfast was a complete farce , a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom , which had then to be carried back to the bedroom , where there was no where to eat but on the bed .

absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews , we were a bit weary about this hotel . It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop .

ideal location excellent location , not knowing the city , we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area , pier 39 , the deals , alcatraz . The hotel was very plush inside , staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile . Our room was fantatic , modern clean and decorated to a very high standard . The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn ' t get to appreciate the facilities . Would suggest this hotel used if time to be spent relaxing within the hotel , if a hotel needed to use as a base for sightseeing then maybe this one is a little too expensive .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideal'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideally located to the tourist area'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'efficient , polite'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'nver without a smile'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'very plush inside'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'fantatic'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'modern'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'decorated to a very high standard'], ['facilities', 'facilities general', 'negative', "didn ' t get to appreciate"], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'suggest'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'neutral', 'little too expensive']]
Good FQ option We had a very nice night at the Monteleone . The location is excellent and the room was clean and quiet . We did not have a view but we slept like rocks .

Nice hotel , uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance . It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small , considering it is in Florida . The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy ; I am sure it will improve in the next few years . Overall a good hotel for business meetings but not for vacationers .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'uninteresting'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very adequate'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'downtown Miami is a hinderance'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'far from the beaches'], ['pool', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'very small'], ['health facilities', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'very small'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'noisy'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'good'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not for vacationers']]
Disappointing and watch the final bill I ' ve stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated ( given the price ) I ' ve returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it . I wouldn ' t return to The Clift ; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge / front door staff are all good but that ' s about it . The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen ( and I had a loft suite ) - and for the price other hotels offer more ( no flat screen TV , ineffective air con ) . What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US $ 185 for late checkout without any notification ( I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11 . 00am ) . E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation .####[['Clift', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'watch the final bill'], ['Clift', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Disappointing'], ['Clift', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'bit dated'], ['Redwood Bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'fun'], ['concierge / front door staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'all good'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'smallest'], ['flat screen TV', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'no'], ['air con', 'room_amenities quality', 'negative', 'ineffective'], ['service', 'service general', 'negative', 'charged me an additional US $ 185 for late checkout'], ['service', 'service general', 'negative', 'no response'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'made immediately'], ['service', 'service general', 'negative', 'no apology or explanation']]
Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location , that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar , and the rudness of the people at the front desk . Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise , and when you only need five minutes to get to any place , you forget the rudness of the front desk staff . The rooms were clean , the breakfast was ok , and remember this , if is clean and has a great location , the restis not important . Will definitely come back here . They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm , with very good food .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Wonderful Choice'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'such a wonderful'], ['front desk', 'service general', 'negative', 'rudness'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'noise during the evenings'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'five minutes to get to any place'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'ok'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely come back'], ['restaurant', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'very good']]
Excellent all the way around We always stay at Embassy Suites when we can and this one keeps with the tradition and quality that you come to expect .

IDEAL for large groups . Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30 ' s and 40 ' s . Found it to be a good quality , well run , clean hotel . Staff were all very curteous and welcoming ( even when returning from nights out at 5 . 30AM ) and rooms were clean and adequate . Didn ' t sample the food - plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars within 50 yards . Steps to ( excellent ) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport ( get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T - 10 ticket that allows 10 journeys ) . Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro ' s a day is a bit stiff .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'IDEAL for large groups'], ['hotel', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'good quality'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'well run'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'all very curteous'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'welcoming'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'adequate'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars within 50 yards'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'Metro system are outside the front door'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definately recommend'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'professionally run place'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', "15 Euro ' s a day is a bit stiff "]]
Gem in a Non - Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed . I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don ' t know about this place . We got great service , a great view , a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels ( e . g . , the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical / health activities ) . I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them . I can see why - - nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes ( mostly ) of tourists .

good location , but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october . The price was reasonable , however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week . We wanted 2 singles , but for 2 nights they were ' unavailable ' so we were moved around rooms with double beds . On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double , but we were unable to swap with them .

Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel . When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip , we got a cancellation number . A month later , $ 240 . 57 ( Canadian ) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record . Given , we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful , unsympathetic and snobby ! Shame on them for being in the service industry .

Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed . Our room was a really good size and very comfortable . Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee , it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10 : 30am .

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week ( departed 16 / 8 / 06 ) . The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling .

Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you ' d go to if you want a really upscale , romantic place to stay . BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam .

Awful hotel I spent one night only , fortunately , in this hotel . Upon arrival we had to pay cash before entering the room , theN we found on one bed , dirty linen that had to be changed . The room lacked maintenance on the furniture and in the bathrrom nothing was repared . In the morning breakfast was very poor and when i asked forchocolate for my child they did not have any . And to finish we asked to leave the luggage for the day and it was kept outside in a courtyard getting wet because of the rain .

very pleasant stay Stayed here from 8th April for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay . Staff were very friendly and helpful . The ooms were nice if a tad smaller than we are used to and the absence of a bath was a disappointment having said that the were nicely decorated with modern furnishings and a flat screen TV . The hotel is in a quiet location about 15 minutes walk to the Placa Catalunya or 2 minutes to the Rocaforte Metro stop ( and then 5 minutes on the L3 line to the Pl .

Expensive , Run down , Dirty This hotel does not match the pictures shown on the hotel website . The rooms are not clean and need to be renovated .

decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam , but it wasn ' t too far from it . It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night . It was clean and comfortable , but nothing spectacular . There were a few burn marks , probably from smokers , but I guess that ' s to be expected in Amsterdam .

Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of . Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation , the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel , which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare . We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn ' t get much satisfaction . I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service .

agree with " do not stay here " This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn ' t give it two . A hint to future guests : if you have a problem , it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations . They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it . They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns .

The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were .

I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city . It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included , and free transportation on all the S bahns , U bahns and busses , it is worth it .

A Very Special Place I had done a lot of research into hotels in Venice and with the help of the reviews on tripadvisor I booked my girlfriend and I into the Hotel Al Ponte . We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and can honestly say that it was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in . The rooms were extremely clean and very comfortable .

Good Budget Hotel . . . Key Word = Budget Monte Carlo is clean , fairly comfortable ( very firm beds ) and best of all , well located . Have no qualms about booking this hotel if you ' re travelling on a budget ( I believe we paid around $ 50 a night for a double room w / no WC in high season ) . However , consider skipping breakfast - for 7 Euro , you could do better at a corner bakery .####[['Monte Carlo', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Good Budget'], ['Monte Carlo', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Monte Carlo', 'hotel comfort', 'neutral', 'fairly comfortable'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'very firm beds'], ['Monte Carlo', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'best of all'], ['Monte Carlo', 'location general', 'positive', 'well located'], ['Monte Carlo', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Have no qualms'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'paid around $ 50 a night for a double'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', '7 Euro , you could do better at a corner bakery']]
hip A must reccommend ! ! ! ! Gorgeous intimate hotel where the staff are sublime in chararcter and always prepared to help with a smile . My husband and I stayed for three nights and on each night we asked to upgrade however the hotel is apparantly always full so be prepared and the book the room type you want early .

l location I stayed a couple of days in NYC on my way home from the West Coast . I picked the Sofitel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and the Internet rates they were offering .

Big rooms , near the night - life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise . Very well - located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well - decorated .

An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us .

Some may consider the rooms on the small side , but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair , you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer .

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia . The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted , but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations . Not the best news for our daughters , who were eager to swim after the flight ! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door , but whilst better than nothing , this was not terribly convenient .

#4 Hotel in Los Angeles ? ? ? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights . Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms . Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like . The carpeting was stained , there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub .

Restaurant Recs The Ritz is a terrific hotel but their restaurant recommendations need updating . The consierge sent me to a so - so Sushi place called San Raku and then to an awful Chinese place called Oriental Pearl .

Recommended by a fussy pair ! My friend and I stayed in Room 273 and found it to be clean and comfortable . Sheets and towels changed daily , room was sufficient size with tea making facilities replenished each day , breakfast was simple but very edible and the staff , although we didn ' t require much , were helpful ! Internet access available , storage for baggage , definately would stay here again and worth the money . Located on a quiet street beside Vondelpark , PC Hoovestraat , with great shopping and trams .

Total incompetence The staff at this hotel all of the way up the manager are totally , totally incompetent , definitely stay away !

worth the price ! We stayed at the Ritz Millenia for 5 days in Sep 06 . Their staff were super friendly - and made all the arrangements we asked for . The location is perfect for evening walks by the river , with all the restaurants nearby . The bathroom was the highlight of the accomodations - we had the river view which was spectacular . Will definitely recommend this place to anyone !

Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic , the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms . It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin ( its very cheap , efficient and easy to navigate ) but the area was no problem - I guess it ' s worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are . I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price , venue and facilities ( breakfast , spa , small bar , minibar , bikes available and outside seating ) .

Very central to Union Square and transport links , I was very pleased with my find as we were so central ! Good bed in average sized room , very large bathroom , breakfast supplied in lobby in the morning is the average American continental danish and coffee .

Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6 - 10 June 2008 for 4 nights . We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge / freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there . Could not fault it at all . Hotel is in a great location , plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station .

great everything Booked this hotel through Last Minute . com when my other hotel booking was in euros and needed a better deal . This hotel was first class , on arrival at reception got served immediately given all the info I needed with maps and details of trips and buses . room was very clean , the bed was huge , the buffet breakfast was brilliant and catered for every taste . The hotel was a 5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port , with regular buses and a metro stop outside . Ended up walking everywhere as the sights are not far apart , a brilliant weekend , thanks####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great'], ['hotel', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'first class'], ['reception', 'service general', 'positive', 'served immediately'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['bed', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'huge'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'brilliant'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'catered for every taste'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'sights are not far apart']]
Bargain , excellent accomodations Our family of four stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza in Florence during March 2006 . We were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and the stylish modern furnishings ( bathroom as well ) . Staff was pleasant and very knowledgable about surrounding area and history . Excellent location within walking distance of the train station and hotel parking ( reasonable daily rate OF $ 13 . 00 US ) . Best value and accomodations of the six hotels we stayed at in Italy .####[['Hotel Porta Faenza', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'pleasantly surprised'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spaciousness'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'cleanliness'], ['furnishings', 'room_amenities design_features', 'positive', 'stylish modern'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'pleasant'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very knowledgable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'within walking distance of the train station'], ['parking', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'reasonable daily rate OF $ 13 . 00 US'], ['Hotel Porta Faenza', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'Best value']]

Intimate Hotel with Great Service The Chesterfield Mayfair remains my favourite hotel in London . The location is fantastic . The hotel is intimate and very British . The staff , especially the concierge Chris , go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome .

Gran Ronda Good Location The Gran Ronda is well placed , it ' s on a road that runs parallel to La Rambla . You can walk to the North end off La Rambla via a well lit side street within 10 mins . The breakfasts are superb with a wide choice of both continental and English style food . The rooms are well appointed and very clean .####[['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['Gran Ronda', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'well placed'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'road that runs parallel to La Rambla'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'walk to the North end off La Rambla'], ['breakfasts', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'superb'], ['breakfasts', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'wide choice of both continental and English style food'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'well appointed'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean']]
The Best We normally stay at 5 star hotels and this is a 4 star . We were also a bit sceptical when we saw the pictures of the bright rooms on the web but this was the best hotel . Location perfect and the staff beyond friendly and helpful . To not stay at this hotel would be a mistake !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'best'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful']]
really liked it We stayed in December just for 1 night , but I liked the location , the room ( great bed ) and the staff . The restaurant was very good . It is joined by the skyway to 2 rather pricey malls , but is was good not to have to go outside to shop . Legal Seafood is in the mall , Yummy ! I would stay again in the summer as it is not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around .####[['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'really liked'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'liked'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great bed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'stay again'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around']]
Excellent accomodations . Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace . It is a lovely hotel deserving of it ' s 5 star rating . The employees were very helpful , very accomodating . Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money , asking about areas we wanted to visit , ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants , even getting a massage . This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous .####[['Loong Palace', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['Loong Palace', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lovely'], ['Loong Palace', 'hotel quality', 'positive', '5 star rating'], ['employees', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['employees', 'service general', 'positive', 'very accomodating'], ['Loong Palace', 'location general', 'negative', 'bit out of downtown Beijing']]
I loved everything The building is fantastic , the hotel is wonderful , true luxury at affordable prices ( I looked for , and found , a special offer on the hotel website ) . The bed is awfully confortable , you have complimentary bar , full of refreshments and some snacks , the toiletries are by Lanvin . The staff is very polite . The location is in front of the railway station , and short walking distance from the Dam .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'loved everything'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'building is fantastic'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'true luxury'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'affordable prices'], ['bed', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'awfully confortable'], ['bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'complimentary'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very polite'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'front of the railway station'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'short walking distance from the Dam']]
Great Hotel experience Stayed six nights and had a great time . Hotel staff were excellent . Room was spacious and two queen beds were so comfortable .

The staff make this hotel truly awesome ! We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel . The staff at the hotel were simply superb ; Mendrin , Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24 / 7 ! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front , with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants . Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options , imported spirits , late check out and free laundry service ! Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don ' t forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions !####[['Melia Benoa', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'truly awesome'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'simply superb'], ['Mendrin , Pardi and Augustini', 'service general', 'positive', 'highlights providing service with a smile 24 / 7'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'right on the beach front'], ['facilities', 'facilities quality', 'positive', 'superb'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'never crowded'], ['pool bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'never crowded'], ['restaurants', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'choice of 3 fully functional']]
The views are just to die for ! ! ! Stayed here for a long week - end , November 4th - 8th , in Room 308 and the views from that room were marvellous , the Louvre , the Musee D ' Orsay and the Eiffel Tower and we overlooked the Tuilleries , these views were even better at night when Paris was lit - up ! ! ! The room was comfortable , fantastic bathroom - huge and the bed was one of the most comfy that I have slept in anywhere in the world and the hotel is in a wonderful location . Breakfast is a bit disappointing , the pain au chocolat at the Musee D ' Orsay are superb !####[['views', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'just to die for'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'marvellous'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'overlooked the Tuilleries'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'even better at night when Paris was lit - up'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['bathroom', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'huge'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'bed was one of the most comfy'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'bit disappointing']]
Never stay here ! Whew , this place was bad . The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn ' t let my kids in it , the whole place smelled , and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments . I was literally scared of this place , and when I reported it to the desk , they just said they couldn ' t stop the calls because they were coming from within the building . Sounds like the beginning of a teen horror movie , doesn ' t it ?####[['NULL', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'bad'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Never stay here'], ['pool', 'facilities quality', 'negative', 'such a scum'], ['pool', 'facilities cleanliness', 'negative', 'whole place smelled'], ['NULL', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments'], ['NULL', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'literally scared'], ['desk', 'service general', 'negative', "couldn ' t stop the calls"]]
Over rated For the price you pay , make sure you get one of the better rooms . When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade ( basically all the cars going up can see you ) . I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later , I got the one I wanted , with a bit of a view for the same price . There ' s nothing extraordinary about this hotel , the gym is quaint , the rooms are small , the bathroom is actually really big , it was about 1 / 2 the size of the bedroom . . . the restaurant is pretty cool .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'Over rated For the price you pa'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'nothing extraordinary'], ['gym', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'quaint'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'actually really big'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'pretty cool ']]
