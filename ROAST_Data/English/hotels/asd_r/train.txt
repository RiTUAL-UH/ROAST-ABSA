Excellent location and view! I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location, new decorum view from our 21st level room and a complementary breakfast in the early morning before our tour. I haven't visited Waikiki Beach in decades and this overnight was a great way to end our week in Hawaii. Stacey and Agnes at the Expedia Desk were extremely helpful - booking a Pearl Harbor Tour and a last minute shuttle to the airport.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Hoped for more I went on Orbitz.com to book the hotel and was quite excited after reading the reviews and seeing pictures of the hotel. Arrival and check in was a breeze but the room was not what I expected. he bed was terribly uncomfortable, the room was small, and the view was terrible. It's very close to the action, but next time I will spend a couple extra bucks to stay somewhere I know I will enjoy.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Pleasantly surprised Very close to airport, staff kindly checked me in very early and after I freshened up pointed me in the right direction to the main centre. here is a 4 storey outlet mall attached and MTR right next door. 20minutes and in Kowloon. Room was unexpectedly ample, well fitted out and great value.

Fantastic location We stayed here for one night on the 3rd leg of our Honeymoon and it was fantastic, we had a suite with a little kitchen and a lounge and a large bedroom. We were travelling with our 7 year old little girl. he location was great as it was only a 10 - 15 min walk to the CN Tower which was great. In the morning we received a complementary breakfast which was great and it set us up for the day. Would definatly stay here if we returned to Toronto.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Wow!! oved the Westin If you are staying in Beijing, the brand new Westin is the way to go. Very convenient to the metro and all of the attractions.

Beautiful Hotel in the Middle of Tokyo After staying in the Akasaka Excel Hotel, we moved to the Prince because it was cheaper and are we glad we did! he Prince is a beautiful hotel with big, modern rooms (some with a panaoramic view of Tokyo). he service was also excellent and the price was excellent. We never ate there as there are many local dining options just down the street. Highly recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Great base for seeing LA We were very pleased with our stay at the Holiday Inn Universal Studios (formerly known as the Beverly Garland). Although it is a bit noisy due to proximity to Highway 101, it didn't stop us from sleeping and the proximity to 101 meant driving around was easy. he rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool area was great and the food in the restaurant was excellent. Altogether great value for money.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Best Location in Barceloma his is possibly the best located hotel in Barcelona - right in front of the Gothic Quarter, and only 5 minutes walk to La Ramblas (just far enough away).

Great small hotel in the old town There can't be many hotels on earth owned by such a fascinating man as this one. he rooms are all equipped not only with everything you need for a very comfortable (and affordable) stay, but also with copies of the owner's writings - thoughts, reflections and words of wisdom, a kind of cross between Khalil Gibran and Marcus Aurelius. He himself is an inspired and inspiring presence, and a stay in his wonderful, charmed hotel is capable of changing the course of a person's life. here are testimonies on the internet to this effect. It seems he will drop everything for a deep conversation with a guest. he hotel also has a wonderful rooftop bar and restaurant, which is great place to catch the evening light and eat excellent local gourmet food.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Good location This is a great location but don't expect a great view from your room. he staff was pleasant but small. he mattress was very firm. It is right next to the market area which has a great place to exchange currency for no fee. It is also a good place to pick up a low priced breakfast or lunch.

It is the Flower of St. Charles Had never heard of this hotel, but was pleasantly surprised to find it looking great. obby is inviting, personnel helpful, lovely ambience, cannot say enough about the accomodations..

ocation and Service Impeccable I stayed here for a convention that was held a few blocks away and was blown away at how incredibly perfect everything was. he price was super reasonable. he service was perfect. he accommodations and amenities left nothing more to be desired (except maybe an indoor pool but not a big deal in my opinion). ot to mention the location was in the dead heart of everything and walking distance to the convention center.

Great Views, Great Hotel I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days and must say that this is one of the better hotels in the country. I was in room 3905 which had a great view of the golden gate bridge in the background. Staff can't do enough for you, they always call you by name. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant Silks, but everything else in the hotel is top notch. hey had a good rate of $395 a night for a room which normally sells for $610 a night.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
Great location - shame about the noise We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. he location was excellent. he furnishings in the room were a bit dark and dreary. he first night was quiet but the room next door was occupied the second night, and we could hear every noise.

a walk to everything I read the reviews on this hotel after i had booked!!!! hen i started to worry about where l was staying, but it was all good,the rooms are tired and bathrooms need renovating but you are hardly ever in your room we had a partial ocean view on the 11th floor it was very relaxing good buffet breakfast included and so close to everything. I would deffinately stay there again, from what l hear most of the hotels need a good overhaul in Hawaii, dont worry about staying there you will have a great time.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Great Value! Aparthotel Silver is a good, clean, tourist class hotel in a quiet neighbourhood just north of the city centre. It provides excellent value compared with central hotels and offers a great buffet breakfast. Staff are friendly and helpful. ransport links are brilliant - the hotel is 80m from the metro station (Fontana) and then 5 minutes from the heart of the city (Line 3).####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
oved the hotel 5 of my girlfriends and I have just returned from Punta Cana and overall our visit was quite pleasant. he weather was great. he hotel was very nice, spacious and it had many options as far as food and restaurants. We highly recommend the restaurant 'La Res' - the food was superb. he only downfall of our trip was that we found most of the staff to be extremely rude and not very attentive and courteous.

Good for a Stop over We had a somewhat small room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?section of the hotel, which I think is mainly used by stopover passengers en route to Australia. he staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was very clean and welcoming. Wardrobe space was somewhat limited after luggage storage and the small sit in bath required careful negotiation in order to stand in a flat area for a shower. he room although small was pleasant enough but the lighting was very poor and I found it very difficult to read standard size font (such as 11 of 12 point) after it had got dark.####[['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
ustomer Service is amazing! When it comes right down to it, the Renew is a great place to stay because of the attitude of the staff who take customer service very seriously and did everything that they could to make my one week stay comfortable. he Renew still needs to renew their air conditioner units which are aging and a little week. n the whole, a great place to stay. Such a nice alternative to places like the Hilton.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral']]
Great hotel, great service I was impressed by all aspects of the Affinia 50. Sophistication without the attitude, which is so hard to find. When I was concerned about how to find a particular restaurant by cab, the person at the front desk found the restaurant in the NYC Zagat guide and made a copy of the listing for me. he service from the bell staff was equally terrific. I can't wait to return!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
ruly amazing Returned on 12th June - it was fabulous. Even better than the photos!In addition to all the things other people say in their reviews aboutthe pool, drinks, food, luxury room etc, I especially liked the beautiful design of the resort and lovely touches like the wonderful selection of colourful plants and flowers, parrots, flamingos, fish etc. We also enjoyed the poolside activities eg Spanish lessons, Aqua Aerobics - thanks to the activity team who did a great job. My only complaint would be the Thomas Cook rep who was hopeless and the MyTravel flights to/from London Gatwick which were the most uncomfortable flights I've ever had the misfortune to take.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great location and spacious room Can't argue with the location (short walk to Universal Studios, short drive to Hollywood and downtown), or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom. Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day (you will need time to explore LA). nly downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access. Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras, but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn't avoid them due to crcumstances. Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced (extra to cost of room) verall, pretty good, just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Very good breakfast for the value- book in advance from the hotel website so it is only half price -8 euros. he staff is very nice and the free 4 bottles of water per day are a bonus very wellcome - barcelona is hot.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
ovely hotel, brilliant location I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Brilliant location, loads of nice restuarants near to the Lodge and close enough to mid and downtown to make it easy to get everywhere else. Yes the rooms are small but they are perfectly adequate especially if you are planning to be out most of the time. oilets were never busy and the whole place was clean and beautifully finished. I loved it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]

Did not love the Chealsea Lodge First of all, I rely on Trip Advisor for my traveling. he room that I stayed in was horribly small. he TV didn't get great reception, the shower kept going from scalding to freezing, and there was a huge pipe in the room that kept whistling like a tea kettle. he cleaning staff was very friendly. However, when we explained to the problem with our room (whistling pipe), they were not willing to accommodate us at all.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
Sweeping city views his is a great new hotel in San Francisco close to the Convention Centre and the main shopping area. I had the luxury of staying in one of the well appointed junior suites. hese are located on the corners of the building so the room has huge floor to ceiling windows on two sides (also extending into the bathroom).The room was huge, complete with iPod docking station, huge flat screen TV and a massive bathroom with a walk-in double shower at one end. All the staff were courteous, especially the cheerful spa staff and my three night stay was very pleasant.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
here are better choices I stayed at the Shinjuku Washington, hoping to save a bit of money on a trip to Tokyo. he hotel lobby was in a chaotic state and the staff were not particularly helpful or courteous. My room was clean, but truly tiny and in need of refurbishment. I had to pay extra to leave my luggage for a couple hours after check-out. I would prefer spending more for a nicer hotel, such as the Century Southern Tower in the same area or the Mercure Ginza.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]
Wonderful hotel his is a wonderful hotel, probably the best we've ever stayed in, lovely spacious room and bathroom, and the friendliest and most helpful staff, with no exceptions. Its location is excellent too. Well worth paying extra for access to the executive lounge. Even the heavy rain couldn't dampen our enjoyment as the hotel provided huge umbrellas free of charge for the duration of our stay.

Rude people at the QT Bartender in the hotel was a jerk and used strong language towards my wife and I. After complaining to the manager, she made us feel like it was our fault for requesting a drink around midnight. Don't call the hotel for rates, shop through Hotels or something similar for best rates. Another couple traveling with us got a cheaper rate by doing so, and the manager would not match their rate. K location, 1/2 a block from time squ. ot sure if I would ever stay there again. here are a ton of hotels and I say, look elsewher####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Must have been in a different hotel than others Seeing all the rave reviews of this place, I must have been at another hotel, there is nothing decent in downtown NO, or its clientele is too young and/or drunk to know any better. Desk service is condescending, except for the sheets rooms are really not well-maintained, carpet is badly stained, and everything is worn-out. Good but noisy location with thin walls. Downstairs breakfast restaurant looks mediocre and expensive, though the night club looks intrguing. Would stay again only if stuck. ip: Unless the season is very busy, you can probably get very deep discount coupons at Visitor Center, so don't reserve ahead.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
A Great Base of Operations for Uptown Manhattan I was a bit concerned about staying at the Marquis right up until the moment we checked in. ur stay could not have been any better. Decent sized room for NYC, very quiet, great bed, helpful staff, excellent bars and restaurants, and the most efficient elevator system I have ever seen in a high rise hotel. ocation was the most critical thing to me in picking out an NYC hotel and this one would be hard to beat.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
Great amenities for the price If you want a first class or corporate hotel in a nondescript cityscape, then stay away from the Perak, instead book at one of the glass and concrete boxes on Orchard Road. he Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore. For around $70USD per night you get a clean (albiet small) room, with basic but nice appointments(Cable TV, A/C, DVD, free wireless internet, etc), a good location in vibrant Little India, and basic but tasty buffet breakfast. I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up. But the cheapest rooms at the Perak have a skylight rather than a window and are much quieter if noise is an issu####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

We have stayed at Hotel Catedral for the past 16 years whenever we go to Mexico City for business or pleasure. he staff knows us and we always get excellent service and treatment. he rooms are clean and comfortable and the restaurant is fantastic.

problems in paradise I was travelling on a family gathering in Miami, and my family booked at this hotel previously. I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered, subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600, on return luggage from our room had been stolen. My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this, the first question they asked was should we call the police? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees, thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound. My warning is this: the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant, be very careful about your possessions and use the safe!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Budget his hotel is a typical budget down town Amsterdam hotel. In other words, its not for you if you are looking for something nice and cosy. It's for you who are looking for cheaper great location, walking distance to the centrum and Amsterdam Centraal station. It's not to clean and rooms are small, typical down town European. I stay there because of price and location only and only when I'm alone, would not offer it for family.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]

harming, romantic, quaint No complaints. Very, very pleasant accomodating staff. Room was lovely and quite large with a king bed and ultra comfortable mattress. either my husband or I felt unsafe in the area even after dark, but I can see if you're somewhat skittish you might be nervous since it isn't a high traffic area like it is right on Union Square. Great shower and vanity and loved the complimentary sodas in the fridge everyday.

Superb breakfast view k, I'm a little biased because Berlin in the snow in mid-February is inspiring, but this was a superbly located hotel, with great facilities and very helpful staff (whose English is far better than mein Deutsche). My girlfriend pointed out that were it slightly further up the Ku'damm, by only about 75 metres, it would be more expensive to reflect the slight-change in area, so it really is a bargain. I've never been in a hotel where for such little outlay you have a MASSIVE bath in a marble bathroom, set in a large, well laid-out clean and comfortable room. My top tips would be to have the (very ample buffet) breakfast there, whilst enjoying the view from the 6th floor -fruhstuck even runs until 10, so you can still have a bit of a lie-in; and to get a City/ Welcome card, as the hotel is very close to stations for all the forms of transport (except trams, being located in the West), thereby utilising its much raved about location. We would eagerly use it again.####[['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Best hotel we've ever stayed in This hotel is absolutely suberb - perfect location (10 min walk to main shopping street and 15-20 min walk to Forbidden City / Tian'anmen Square); very efficient, helpful and friendly staff who speak good english; and the rooms / leisure facilities are excellent. Very good breakfast and the one evening meal we had there was first class too. All in all a perfect hotel from which to see Beijing from and the best hotel we've ever stayed in.p.s. when walking around Beijing take toilet paper with you as the public loos don't provide it!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Easter in San Francisco We had a very nice clean room with plenty of towels for our family of four. We did not use the restaurant, but found many places within walking distance for all meals. he wharf area has plenty of eateries and things to see. his Sheraton is not a resort - so we didn't expect to dine, swim, or exercise while visiting. his is a clean safe place to stay while visiting a major US city.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
ut of the ordinary This is an unusual hotel, different from the normal run of the mill. I had a large and comfortable room, minimalist design which actually turned out to be quite relaxing! Its a few stops on the tram from the city, the road is reasonably quiet. he tram stop is close by, as is the canal hopper service. If you like design, or want to try something different then this might be for you.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

Great location Stayed here for a weekend in mid-November. Hotel was fine - very good location, close to bars, restaurants, canal boat tours centraal station - it was clean and efficient and we had no complaints. We had read previous reviews and knew what to expect - despite the Crowne Plaza brand this is three star/travel inn standard (not the four star advertised) - so find a good deal  only pay three star prices! Amsterdam is a great walking city - just watch out for bicycles!!!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]

Very centrally located We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and were very pleased with our choice. he hotel was less than a 5-minute walk from the Shinjuku Station and close to everything (shops, restaurants, etc). Although the rooms were a bit tiny as are all Tokyo hotel rooms I was told, they were very clean. he lobby was nicely designed with modern decor; very stylish and chic. verall, we had a wonderful time staying at the Sunroute Plaza.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Good standard motel Stayed here at the start end end of our Northwest States tour. Good clean rooms if not a bit 'worn' and perhaps in need of a little updating. Bathrooms very small but clean and adequate. Breakfast included in price- Juice, baguels, toast cereals, and do it yourself waffles. Airport shuttle was good and left on time (runs every half hour) only a few mins from airport.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Met or exceeded ALL expectations! We are a family of four (two adults and two daughters, ages 18  20). We stayed in one of the apartments for five nights and in two of the hotel rooms for one night. nly one negative to report--the new paint fumes in the hotel rooms on our last night. ther than that, I STRONGLY recommend this property. Very clean, very quiet, excellent location--two METRO stops close by, safe and secure, comfortable beds, friendly  helpful staff, walking distance to excellent retaurants, reasonably priced.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Lovely My friends and I stayed here for four nights over the St Patricks day period. Our rooms were on the 36th floor, really nice rooms, very clean and modern, maid service every day. The only thing I would fault would be, some of the reception staff are quite rude, and keep an eye on your bill with the bar staff, if they are serving at your table, keep tabs of what you had as they do seem to try to add drinks on that you haven't had, or imply you haven't paid! This also happened to another couple who were staying there the same time as us!Apart from that, good location and a lovely hotel, would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive']]
As good as ever..the best! Interconnecting Garden Wing rooms were ideal for the family. As ever, we were looked after famously and everyone enjoyed eating out at The LIne.

Another strong recommendation!####[['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great Customer Service at the Ramada We had a problem with our reservation when we arrived because we had not booked directly with the hotel and the hotel was full. However, they went above and beyond and gave us a special deal while spending forever on the phone with the internet company we had booked through. They were great!####[['service general', 'positive']]
Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor, and all the previous positive reviews are spot on. The Europa doesn't seem to appear in any guidebooks, and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising, but once you arrive in the hotel, Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts. The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished, and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes' walk from the Duomo. Our group of 13 stayed for a week, and felt we really had found a home from home.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great hotel, shame about the price increase! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother-Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality/cost ratio of Regent's Garden Hotel. We got a really nice, recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro (booked direct on the hotels website).However, rather large negative: A few weeks later, having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband, I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3* to a 4* hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros! A huge increase which dramatically changes the 'value for money' aspect of the hotel. While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment, it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it's a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here (a comment I made to the hotel).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
100% Happy. Was very sad to leave! Great views of the harbour/city, great service, great hotel, great room, great food, great bar, great facilities, great location, clean, comfortable, modern and the staff were always as helpful as they could be. It felt like a 5 star hotel but without a 5 star price. When I go back to HK assuming the prices are the same or similar I will definately stay there next time.

Seriously lacking This particular Four Seasons property was absolutely forgettable. From the moment we pulled up, the service was way below expectation....sitting in the car with the luggage for several minutes (no bellhop) and having to re-circle the property to get help with the bags, to the missed wake-up call, to waiting for 45 minutes for a coctail server to approach our table in the lounge... everything seemed to be a bit off. The saving grace of this hotel (aside from the great location)would be front desk/management team. They were overall very professional and super courteous.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive']]
agree with previous re bedrooms I agree with the previous review- the bedrooms let the hotel down - there is obviously a variety of bedrooms. Our first bedroom was on the fourth floor at the back with a view of the inner courtyard - would have been fine if the room had not been so hot. Complained and told that this room did not have air-conditioning - moved to the room previously described with floor level windows and air-conditioning. Otherwise the hotel was excellent including the breakfast and location.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great Atmosphere If you are looking for something at little out of the ordinary stay at the hotel Zaza. Everything about the place is unique. The quality of the service and back drops are not great, but if you can overlook the details it is worth the stay.

Amazing hospitality! The young man who greeted us, Mozah, was very professional even though we arrived late.

Very clean suite and would not hesitate to book for an extended stay as the location was close to everything! Two thumbs up for affordable accommodations. R.

Great location, friendly family-run hotel Nice family-run hotel in a great location - just a couple blocks from the Duomo, Galleria dell'Accedemia, and close to many other sites (although I do recommend taking a taxi from the train station if you have luggage - cost is only about 8 Euro from the train station to the hotel). The owners and staff are extremely accomodating, offering good advice to restaurants (their recommendation of Za Za's Tratorria was so good we went back our last night), tours and anything else you need to know. They made reservations for us for dinner and a tour and we were happy with each. They take pride in making sure everyone enjoys their stay.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Mixed review We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday and I had booked 4 rooms. We had problems with the final billing for 3 of those bills. I received an internet rate of $64 a night, but the bill indicated $127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room. Check your billing statement. Also, the rooms were very small and our view was the room of the building next store, but for $64 I can't complain. On the other hand, great location and the staff are very nice.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great location; Comfortable hotel - shame about the building We picked the Radisson by chance out of a very long list of Boston hotels. Despite being the ugliest building in Boston it is a comfortable hotel whose location is fantastic for most of the central Boston attractions.

Good hotel, problem with a burger I stayed here after a Red River Shootout, and it was good. The room was cozy and it was easy to access.

11 days in HK We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel from 07/03/2006-16/03/2006 and found our stay to be most enjoyable. The hotel is quite basic,with a bar fridge and kettle,very clean and well located in Wanchai,with shops (two good bakeries nearby) and Times Square an easy walk, transport is very close. The concierge, the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive. The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room, the beds are easy enough to push together.

Good value, Good location Booked a two night stay including breakfast both days and evening meal on first night for 拢179.Evening meal was absolutely awful, supposedly nouveau cuisine but simply an excuse to serve minute portions of tasteless food. However everything else was great and in contrast to the evening meal, the buffet breakfast was fantastic. Room very nicely decorated, 11th floor had great panoramic view from Greenwich to Crystal Palace. The location is also good just yards from South Quay DLR station.

Good find in Paris A good hotel away from the main touristy areas of Paris. Staff were very friendly, helpful and the accomodation was a fair size. Although the bathroom in my room seemed a little dated compared to others in the hotel, the whole room very clean and comfortable offering excellent value for money. Location wise, the hotel has plenty of cafes and restuarants nearby as well as some excellent patisseries. It's between two metro stops and one metro stop down from the Gare de Nord, so for getting around public transport / in and out of Paris it was ideal.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

The hotel is stylish and well appointed rooms with spacious beds, bathrooms, wide-screen TVs and DVD players make for a comfortable stay.

A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms, second (third) floor. An absolutely beautiful place, clean and new with real Venetian decor (go to the Ca'Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room!). Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants. I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue, they were super nice and helpful.

Functional downtown hotel Stayed for 2 nights in July 06, a functional hotel located slightly away from downtown but within 10 minutes walk of most of the sights. I'd have this down as a 3 star rather than 2.5.Received a warm welcome on arrival, and we were able to check-in despite arriving early, lots of information offered by the reception staff and secure underground parking (for $16 per day).Room was clean but not huge. The receptionist advised that the hotel was going to be refurbished later in the year, but it had cable TV, air con and everything else you need when your planning to spend most of your time exploring a fantastic city like Seattle. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the first day but it was over-priced and the food wasn't great. On the second day we chose to go to one of the many local coffee shops, which was much better and cheaper!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]
Prescott - A lifesaver THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n't provide high speed access. They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop. I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time. THe only reason I didn't give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service. It is difficult to find a place in the neighbourhood to get a reasonably priced meal - you don't want $30.00 entrees every night.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great. Room was very small but was perfect for us, it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom. We stayed for three nights in total, it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay (1 week).As mentioned in other reviews, it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere.

Perfect Location... Fun Hotel Just returned from a two-night stay at the Triton, and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn't helpful enough. We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood (Taylor St., Ryoko and Le Colonial) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge, Nick. Add to that a perfect location -- practically in Chinatown, right next to Union Square, and convenient to the waterfront--and a fun decor. It's true that some facilities could use better upkeep (e.g., plumbing), but for the price, I would go back to Triton again in a heartbeat.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

The hotel is a little tired however they are working on that and it will be rectified, the breakfast was wonderful with lots of choice. All in all we would definitely stay here again. If you are going to Berlin for a few days and know how to ride a pushbike we would strongly recommend the fat tire bike company, nothing too strenuous, but a great way of seeing the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Four Season Mexico City Perfect way to end our week in Mexico. You can walk right past this building and never know its there. Once inside however, you know your there. I have never had the oppurtunity to stay at such a hotel, for me this was brilliant. Wonderful location on Reforma, easy ride to the airport.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great Room and nice place to say We only got to stay one night here -- we were on a two week trip out West -- wished we could have stayed longer. The room was WONDERFUL. The hotel was clean, staff was helpful, it was in a great location, just beautiful. We walked to the Diamondbacks game. Great place to stay, would definitely recommend it.

great hotel just got back from a 1 night stay, the location of the hotel is fantastic just at the top of Las Ramblas. Hotel itself is spotless as were the rooms.

Excellent Hotel - great location Excellent location, right next to Gran Via Metro station and within walking distance of many of the tourist attractionsWe had a nice room with a balcony, which enabled us to see all the way down the Gran Via. The free mini-bar was a bonus and the free glass of cava in reception was also a nice touch. Breakfast had many options and the staff were pleasant and courteous throughout. We booked the Senator on the back of positive reviews here and they were not wrong. Highly recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Wonderful vacation! We stayed for 2 nights in a room we got a special deal on. This was a beautiful hotel, the decor and ambiance was exactly what we were hoping for. The pool and hot tub area was amazing, although we had hardly any time to relax we were so busy touring LA. The staff was friendly and helpful. We also ran into some late night filming of CSI right outside the hotel which was a great experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Lovely hosts, but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts, but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans, with some surprise at guests that are not americans (i.e. us). This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple. Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse, whereas Florence is very diverse!!The rooms are large, but some features such as bathrooms do need updating. Breakfast is not included, which is a shame as many hotels in Italy offer it.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]

Great Breakfast Stayed at the Catalonia Aragon for 3 nights last month (November 2005). Clean, stylish rooms. Front Desk was extremely helpful with our lost luggage problem.

Mislead in cost of internet access I stayed here for three nights the last week of December. It is a good hotel in a good location but:-The hotel's web site implies that internet access is free but that isn't so; they charge $9.95/day regardless of whether you use the provided ethernet cable or wi-fi (aT-mobile service). I used the ethernet cable, but the process of authorizing the charge each day took about five minutes (the system is very slow).-Valet parking costs $31/day.-The restaurant (Cafe 15) had very slow service when I eat there, even though they weren't doing much business.####[['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Loved the Apex City Of London Hotel Booked the Apex City of London Hotel for 2 nights based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. This is the nicest hotel I've stayed in in London to date. The best points of this hotel are the staff, the rooms and the proximity to the tube station. The staff in this hotel were more than helpfull with all our requests. I will be staying here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Convenient, Staff Superb The staff at this hotel are great and go above and beyond the call of duty. I had a terrible case of strepped throat and without delay upon check in and without asking, hot tea, lemon, and biscuits were delivered to my room to help my voice. Stayed in the Tower and while the room wasn't particularly over the top is was clean, spacious and you didn't hear a sound from the busy airport!!! Amazingly convenient to and from trans Atlantic flights.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good hotel, outside city center Large hotel outside city center (15 min walk) on the river Arno. We had a larger room for European standards, but the bathroom was very small and the shower was really small. We did not have breakfast in this hotel, but we did have dinner in one of their restaurants. It was a very quiet night, but service was still slow. They have paid Internet access in their lobby.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Decent package deal Hotel room was decent for the price paid for. It did show some age in the walls and furniture but serves the purpose for a place to stay. Small kichenette was useful for the fridge and microwave. Should always prefer a double over a single king size bed since the room is so much more! Conveniently across from the international market and walking distance to the beach. Also has complimentary trolley to the mall.####[['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good Location Just back from a weekend in London where we stayed in the Luna and Simone Hotel. This is a lovely family run hotel just a few minutes walk from Victoria Station. The staff were extremely friendly and offered loads of helpfull advice on various tours etc. The hotel was spotlessly clean and we couldn't have looked for nicer accomadation in an area that we felt safe walking in both day and night there are some lovely pubs and restaurants within walking distance. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to London.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great Hotel Great location I booked this hotel as a result of reading the reviews. The positive reviews are all correct. This is a new hotel in a great location for a short break visit to Barcelona. 50m from the Cathedral, 200m from Las Ramblas, and 400m from Plaza Cataluyna which is the central arrival point of trains and buses from the airport. The staff are friendly, rooms and general areas clean, and the beds large and comfortable. We did not eat there as too many local cafes, reataurants and bars to experience outside, Small pool on roof terrace, a welcome respite to all the sightseeing.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'neutral']]
asa, Gonzalez, 2 thumbs up We stayed at Casa Gonzalez on May 2004. It鈥檚 a very nice place, just 2 blocks from the Zona Rosa, very pleasant and safe neighborhood and the rooms are very comfortable. It is not a fancy, luxurious place. It鈥檚 a nice house, with beautiful gardens all around the place, excellent attention and great food. All rooms are neat clean, bathroom and hot water and some have terrace or balcony. Beautiful place, I highly recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great price for a downtown two star motel Quite possibly the cheapest price for a motel room in a major city in the downtown area. Clean room with quite new bathroom fixtures. Average friendly staff. And yes, it's on busy Market street which means a bit of traffic at night. Have stayed here before and would consider it again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

First Class After a disastrous start at the Rasa Sentosa, we moved to the Marina Mandarin (superb) and then to the Ritz Carlton for our final four nights in Singapore. Our stay in a suite included access to the club lounge and the experience was so good that we hardly saw the city! Traditional furnishings and fantastic views with a particularly stunning view from the bath!The staff in the lounge could not be faulted and the five, yes five daily food presentations nothing short of fantastic. Great pool area and fitness centre too.

Highly recommended We stayed in the Lorenzo Il Magnifico for 3 nights in August 2004. The standard of the accommodation was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful - to the extent that they sent out for a takeaway pizza on our behalf when my wife was feeling unwell. Considering that accommodation in Florence can be expensive we felt that the hotel represented very good value for money. The location is in a quiet part of town but is within easy reach of the city centre by public transport. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

A Return Visit that did not disappoint Following our visit in October 2005 for a stop over, we used the Langham Place as our base for an extended visit to Hong Kong. Just at the end of the Chinese New Year, the atmosphere was great. This time we stayed in a Club Room and use of the Club Lounge. A nice touch was the complimentary desert from the hotel management on the occaision of my wife's 40th birthday. The location was perfect for access to all parts of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Terrotries - through the MTR and a Hong Kong Octopus Card.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
mfortable and fine We found this hotel to be perfect for our first night stay in San Juan before leaving for Viequez. The staff were very nice, the room was quite large, clean and comfortable.

lean and incredible staff! During my last trip to Florence, I wanted to stay in the heart of the city. Hotel Globus, close to the train station is perfect.

Excellent friendly staff We stayed for four nights at the Castle Inn and enjoyed every minute of it. The room was spacious and clean and the oversized bathroom was a bonus. The staff at reception were always helpful and cheery and nothing was too much trouble. Even giving us super directions to start our road trip. The breakfast was more substantial than we thought it would be so again a good bonus.

Rust, mold and cold water While the refurbished lobby, restaurants and bars are still elegant and luxurious, the standard rooms are far more reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room. Chipped paint, rusting fixtures, moldy grout and an utter lack of amenities. The assorted selections of soaps and shampoos, apparently borrowed from other hotels, is not critical, but is indicative of the curent state of the Biltmore. Waking up to find a mixture of cold to luke warm water dribbling out of the five foot high showerhead only reinforced an already negative impression. The staff are certainly accomodating and room service was adequate, but I would wait until a complete renovation of the rooms before ever staying at the Biltmore again.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Terrible Service I was guaranteed one price for a room and they ended up booking me for an entire other room type and when trying to get it switched to the correct room, would not honor their price I was quoted only 4 hours before. I cancelled my reservation for the rest of the week and stayed only the one night (too late to cancel that night) Not a 5 star hotel. Much better places in a city like New York w/ a lot better locations.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great Hotel Our wedding party stayed here for three nights, there were some problems with the plumbing, but things are just getting back to normal down there.

We will return soon.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Best location We stayed at the Westin over night - and booked it on Priceline for $180. The location is the best if you want to go to the theatre.

hing special Stayed in a $400 per night suite this weekend in SF and was very dissapointed. Room was small and there were stains in the drapes, carpet and duvet. Ran out of toilet paper in the middle of the night and the tissue box was also empty! The spa tub was cracked and the glass shower door came off while in the shower! It was noisy and the view room overlooked the wallgreens and yelling steet people.

Wouldn't atay anywhere else in Manahattan Over the past ten years, we have stayed at Hotel Beacon four times and - having stayed at some other hotels - we would never stay anywhere else in NYC,The rooms are huge and very comfortable with a small but well-equipped kitchenette. It's a great location, stunning views to Central Park or the Hudson from the upper floors - don't forget to ask when booking because they do try to give you what you request; buses and subway within moments of the door - or just walk to Columbus, Amsterdam, Central Park, even Mid -Town. One particularly brilliant aspect of Hotel Beacon: Fairways foodstore directly across Broadway from the Beacon. a jaw-dropping selection of stuff to eat, including a hot food counter which makes eating in any restaurant a bit of a waste of time: grab a bottle of wine at the Beacon Liquor store, Korean chicken or something at Fairways then dine at your Hotel Beacon room window overlooking a million Manhattan lights. Unforgetable. Frankly at these prices there is no point in staying anywhere else, particularly if you fancy experiencing the rather attractive life of an Upper Westside New Yorker!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great Choice Stayed here over the weekend of 12-10-05. Awesome hotel with a great location - but out of the rush. The rooms were so quiet with a flat screen TV.

I would highly recommend this hotel and this area Leidesplein (spelling?).I have also stayed in the NH hotel which is almost next door and the NH is also just as nice but a little younger in it's decor and general mood.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Restaurant Hotel is very nice. Restaurant is overpriced and the food is way below average. The manager Alex is way too arrogant and thinks he is doing you a favor for this very mediocre restaurant. Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen's on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience. Although hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Friendly I stayed in the Friendship hotel with my wife on our first trip to China. Having read numerous guides warning me to wear flip-flops in th shower, etc, I was expecting a very basic hotel, however the Friendship Hotel is anything but.

The hotel bar, Cuffs, was buzzing - I've never seen a hotel bar so popular! Great cocktails and the food in the restaurant next door was great too.

Three cheers for the Ramada I have travelled to Amsterdam many times but this is the best value for money hotel in it's class bar none. My room was imaculate with a comfy bed and was well designed with a cool bathroom and deep bath. The location cannot really be improved upon as it is a mere 5 min. walk to central station and even backs onto a little known red light area for some late night action. The only downsides are the lack of air-con and a fridge, but hey you do get a fan and a fridge is not essential really. All for about 拢40 per night, I have paid considerably more for a lot less, get it booked.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Excellent Hostal  Hostal Adriano/Adria has an excellent location - basically in the heart of Madrid. Very well decorated rooms with little balconies to let in some fresh air (or smoke). A lot of space, blowdryers, safes in room, refrigerator in room, and plenty of soap/shampoo. Noise wasn't a problem for us and the staff was typical stiff Spanish professionalism. I was impressed with the rooms given the great location and low cost - definitely a treasure we found and can't wait to stay there again!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Perfect July 10-16, 2008. A steal for Venezia; includes gondola traffic (Oye!!!), singers and musicians (on the boats) - just open your window. Top service; used the kitchen to save a small fortune on breakfast and supper, thus we could splurge on lunch. (Two people, three courses and a mezzo of vino is often well over 100 euros!) Learn to shop and stock the little fridge. Absolutely would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Location, Location, Location We enjoyed a 3 day stay at the Parc 55! The location is the best because of the proximity to BART (across the street), and the cable cars (1 block away). Westfield Shopping Center is located directly across the street (Nordstroms, Bloomingdale, great food court too).The service and the rooms were excellent and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco that would like to be close to the shopping and public transportation. It is right on Market Street, and is close to Chinatown. Parking is a little pricey at $40 for overnight; however, parking is at a premium at this location. We found great rates for this hotel on Expedia; however, I would recommend that you check out their website (Parc 55) first because they have several special package rates.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Worst hotel ever!!!!!! This was the worst place I have ever stayed. The bathroom smelled so badly like mold that we could not open the door without the entire room smelling.

Matchless in Midtown This hotel is so well located, within walking distance of Grand Central Terminal, and ideal for theatergoers. It is a fairly new tall and narrow building squeezed between two larger ones so there's little natural light, but the rooms are what you'd typically expect from a Marriott Courtyard, and surprisingly roomy for Manhattan...clean with comfortable bedding and plush towels, free internet, good in-room coffee (avoid the lobby machine stuff), flat screen TV, and most of all, a very professional and helpful staff. (We did not choose to use their breakfast option). And the price...$299 for a king-size... is matchless for a nice place in midtown. We will definitely return.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
loved this place My girlfriends i stayed here for a week, We had the best time ever. Everyone there was very courtious with an exception of the unhappy young front desk girl but Orlando down on the beach made up for that. Our room was good sized and our room looked out to the beach. The only downfall to this getaway was when it was time to take a Taxi back to the airport.

Fantastic location! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Alicia. Didn't experience any of the previous reviewer's problems.

Would definately recommend this hotel!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great location, but needs an update My husband and I spent one night at this hotel before flying out early the next morning. For what we needed this hotel served its purpose--it was close to the train station, which we wanted since we were arriving by train, we didn't need breakfast since we were leaving so early, we were able to book one night only (through Expedia) despite the fact that it was a weekend, and the front desk was manned 24 hours so they were able to check us out when we left and they got us a cab. The hotel could use some freshening up, and I agree that it's not four-star quality. However, the location can't be beat and some of the views are amazing.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Most awful hotel we ever stayed at My husband and I stayed at the Raphael in May 04. The rooms were not that great for the amount we payed, and the staff was not friendly.

Great Start to the Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel for 3 nights in August as the 'activity' part of our honeymoon, we booked it soley as a result of its (previous) number 1 position on Trip Advisor. The hotel is super, rooms were great, staff were friendly but the location was just fantastic as we managed to walk most places (Times Square, Macy's, Rockerfeller, Empire State) and it was easy to get the Metro from Times Square for other attractions (Staten Island, Brooklyn Bridge). We ate breakfast every morning at the Red Flame Diner just down the road which was fab. The Hotel provided us with a free bottle of sparkling wine on arrival when we mentioned it was our honeymoon which was a nice touch, the staff really were wonderful.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great place to stay in Paris My friend stayed in this hotel seven years ago and had recommended it to me, and I was not disappointed during my stay there this spring.

Christine was very helpfull and very patient with all the questions we had as the first time travelers to Paris with absolutly no knowledge of French. If you're looking for a good place for a decent price, this hotel would be an excellent choice! Ask for the off street room.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
charming clean hotel Just returned from our trip to Florence. We found this hotel to be all we needed for 3 people. It is clean, with wall to wall hard wood floors, sound proof windows, large modern bathroom and kitchenette which is great for late night or for early morning snacks. We will stay again on our next trip. My only concerns are that more people will find out about this hotel and booking will be difficult.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Wonderful Hotel!! Just returned from a five night stay at the Beacon, and couldn't have been happier. Perfect location, quiet nights, and the convenience of the market across the street made our vacation great. Subway is a short walk down the street, Natural History Museum a couple blocks away, as well as Central Park. The front desk and concierge were especially helpful, and very friendly. Highly recommend this hotel!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good location - otherwise horrible I got the hotel because it was in a good location and the reviews looked plausibly ok however I was very dissapointed. It was in a good location, right next to Chinatown, but it should not be called a hotel, but a cheap motel or a hovel. The room may have been cleaned before we got there, but it was so old that you couldn't tell for sure. Furniture, carpet, bathroom all in horrible condition. Even though it was cheap ~$75/night, it really wasn't worth it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
A Quality Hotel in a Perfect Location ! The Ramada City Centre is a quality hotel that offers all of the services and facilities that are expected from a hotel under the ownership of a major company. The rooms are of a reasonable size with standard tv, radio, telephone, fan, safe, trouser press and tea and coffee making facilites. I stayed for 4 nights and am pleased to report that the room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were also provided daily. The hotel had an impressive large 24 hour reception area, lounge, restaurant and bar, all appeared to be recently renovated/decorated. Within walking distance are Central Station, the main shopping streets and the Red Light District, the trams also stop directly in front of the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Avoid It! Don't Stay Here!staff are rude and nonchalant,rooms are like prison cells, cold and full of strange odours.food is limited and extremely over priced.trying to get a cab to airport is virtually impossible and to be frank it's possibly easier to walk!If you have the option, I would suggest buying a sleeping bag and spending the night in the terminal.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
There are Better Options than this tired, outdated hotel I give it two circles instead of 1, only because of its location next to the Hynes convention center and Prudential Center. We paid $250 per night (convention rate) for a cramped room with low ceilings, outdated furnishings, and paint peeling from the ceiling. The hotel is not friendly to families with young children, and charges extra for items included in lower priced chains, e.g. extra fee to use the fitness center and pool, along with internet. If you want a nice room in the Back Bay, try the Lenox.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative']]
Great Golf - Great Golf Course played 3 days in a row and enjoyed it more each time. Food and rest of the resort is nothing special. Comments in other reviews about dirty pool areas are true.

Great quality for the budget minded traveller We were budget conscious when booking the hotel and its services far exceeded my expectations. Its location was fantastic, close to all the attractions, and transport via the Metro is literally 30sec away. We had a quiet room (unbelievable in NY) and although the bed was a lilttle bit on the small side, we had a comfortable rest. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting decent accomodation in NY but don't want to pay the higher prices of the hotel chains.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral']]

Safer than expected Having read some reviews of this hotel we, as pensioners, were rather apprehensive about tales of dodgy characters and threatening transients in the vicinity of the hotel. However we have just returned from 6 days at the Della Natione and at no time did we feel unsafe or threatened, we also found the Duomo to be a 7 minute walk away not 15 and we are in our 60's. The hotel was comfortable, we had a quiet room which was cleaned regularly together with the bathroom and although the breakfast was continental it was more than adequate with supplies of foods being constantly replenished. The staff were friendly and helpful and pre-booked tickets for us when required.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
great value for money, good area Me and 4 friends stayed in this motel for a few nights in October and were very pleased with the value for money. The motel is indeed on Lombard Street, which is in fact a section of the 101, but as we had rooms away from the street we didn't have any trouble with the noise. The rooms themselves were pretty much the same as any motel room we saw during our round trip, nothing exceptional but very adequate. The biggest plus is the area, it's in a nice little neighbourhood with shops and some excellent dining right around the corner! We particularly enjoyed 'Barneys' with its 'gourmet burgers'. It's not downtown, but a short busride has you in the heart of Chinatown in no time.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral']]
Good value, great location Stayed at the Monticello over Memorial Day weekend 2004. Was genuinely surprised and pleased that the room we reserved turned out to be a suite. I wasn't expecting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful, from replacing our mini-bar when the key broke off in it (!), to addressing a plumbing issue with a tempermental toliet, to securing our bags after checking out while we toured the city on our last day in town, to arranging for our shuttle ride to the airport. Also very convienent to the cable car terminus and other public transportation. All-in-all, a good experience.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Excellent in all areas. We stayed at the Lenox for 4 nights and were treated like special guest through out our stay. The room was spacious and elegant and their committment to the environment was impressive. There was a filtered water access in the hall so need for buying bottled water. It was a special occasion and when they found out they sent wine and cheese to our room. I will definitely stay there the next time I return to Boston.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Excellent Hotel, very helpful staff We booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights before our cruise. The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona, within a few yards to the underground, five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available. We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port (12 - 20 euro, depending on the driver).The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily. The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop. The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9.50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited. Or if you prefer there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

A Room is a Room This is a great place to stay as long as you don't plan on being in your room the whole time - the rooms are small but nicely furnished and the bathrooms are clean. The location is ok - close to Sentosa access but a little further from other attractions such as Chinatown and City Centre - but these are very easily reached by the MRT. If you are planning a holiday where you stay in your room - spring for a place with bigger rooms. Great place to spend the night if only have a quick stop over and money is important!####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

The breakfast was good too and the jaccuzzi's on the roofterras were very nice as well. The staff was very helpfull, the only thing we didn't like was the nearby tapas restaurant they reccomended.

Dexter Ave Holiday Inn- Yuck. Located near the space needle, but not in an area I was comfortable walking in. Our room had a strange odor, the carpet was covered in stains, TV was fuzzy, couldn't get the game system to work. Food in the restaurant was passable, though the wait staff was very pleasant.

Luxury-like experience at an affordable price Boutique-like service at a name brand chain. The Westin times square was a great lodging experience for me. Check-in was a breeze, and I was happy to find that they upgraded my room for me based on a first time comment that I left on my reservation. Hotel is very clean and at a fantastic location. I honestly don't know what else I could recommend in Manhattan unless you are looking for more of a party scene (gansevoort) or even more luxury (lowes regency, morgans group, etc). Honestly, for price to experience ratio, the Weston gets a 10/10 in my book.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great Weekend Getaway Flying down from a colddd Baltimore to Miama and staying 4 days at the Sonesta was a real pleasure. It is only a block away from the heart of Coconut Grove, a very cool little town, and across the street from a nice park (including a skateboard park my son loved).

Our Home in Florence This hotel feels much more like a home than an institution--for us, that feeling came from the moment we met Carmel, who grew up in Boston, and she invited us upstairs onto her lovely outside terrace. Located near enough to the train station to be convenient for travel but on a side street, Hotel Il Bargellino is also near to several Florentine sights. Our only complaint was that the noice from the street can be a little annoying late at night, but it's a trade-off for being right in close proximity to so much. Carmel enticed us as customers by helping us find the best accomodations in her hotel, and we will stay here again upon our next trip to Florence.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Most Disappointed Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months, we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September. Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising. We were incredulous that when we arrived, the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us. This attitude, combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom, led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor. We would not recommend staying at this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]

Highly recommended I don't understand how this hotel could get any bad reviews. My girlfriend and I stayed here from March 22-25, 2005 and found everything more than satisfactory. It has a great location, great price, friendly service, and a good breakfast. We didn't have any problems with making reservations or having clean rooms as was reported by other reviewers. The only complaint I can think of... it was my understanding that parking was included, but we had to pay $7 a night instead. This was still cheaper than any public parking in the area or compared to other hotels in the area.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'neutral']]

The room was not fancy, but was large and very clean and comfortable. This hotel is not on the beach but a beautiful beach is very near by. The only problems we encountered were very few signs directing us to the hotel and when we called the first time, the desk clerk was unable to give us directions from the town plaza which was less than 1 mile away. There are a lot of steps and steep inclines on the property, but overall it was well worth the money.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

The only downsides to our stay were (1) the dinner in the hotel's haute cuisine restaurant, Petrus, which was good, but not good enough for the prices charged (our best meals in HK were in Nobu and in M at the Fringe); and (2) the afternoon tea in the lounge in the Shangri La, which didn't live up to the standards of a five star hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Ahhh, Firenzi Loved it! Our room with a view of the Arno was beautiful and the view absolutely breathtaking. The bed was extremely comfortable, breakfast was fantastic (including champagne for mimosas), the shower was terrible (not clear on why hotels don't have showers that have doors that actually close and keep the water in). The concierge was great (when it wa the actual concierge, and not a temporary fill in) and the front desk staff was fantastic. Terrific location about 1/2 mile from the Uffizi Gallery and right around the corner from a Piazza with shops and restaurants.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Lovely hotel Fantastic hotel, rooms to a very high standard. Staff were very professional and attentive. Breakfast buffet lovely. There are some good restaurants very near by, including an excellent vegan restaurant. Also very close by is the Beverly Shopping Center.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Not the best Hotel is in a great location - short walk to Darling Harbour, shops, restaurants etc. Building and rooms are extremely tired thought and the whole place needs a make-over. The carpets are stained and the interior is very poorly maintained. The buffet lunch was nice, but room service meal was apalling and once done tray and leftovers sat in the hallway for almost a full-day. There are many better choices in Sydney - probably less expensive too.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
New but smal rooms Stayed here in February, for business. The hotel is brand new, clean, in one of the main squares of Berlin next to the TV tower. Not tested the restaurant. Only problem i faced is that the room was very small. At the top of the hotel there is a casino, but you must ear a jacket and no jeans are allowed.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great hotel - would recommend to anyone We stayed on the 14th floor at this hotel for 6 nights in November 2006 and have to say it was excellent. The accom are apartments, very modern and large. Our apartment had a large lounge area, kitchen and dining area, a large bedroom with loads of wardrobe space, a modern large bathroom with shower and bath and there was a washer and dryer in a cupboard. The furniture and fittings were really lovely. The tower itself is close to Darling Harbour and was central for the shops, ferries, and buses. An ideal situation I would definitely stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved the hotel I stayed at a small single room without bath/toilet. Even though I had to share a bathroom, it was very clean and always available because it was shared only between me and a person staying at the next single room. The hotel staff were very helpful and charming. Location was good too. It was close enough to walk from tube, bus stops and Victoria station. I do recommend this hotel to everyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Practical hotel with great location My friend and I stayed there for two nights. I love the location of the hotel, close to the Sol Metro station and walking distance to almost all major tourist sites. Room is clean but has thin walls, we heard showers from next door and cleaning noise (sweeping and vacuuming). Staffs are very helpful in general.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
most inaccessible hotel of the world This is an example of a poorly planned, new hotel tower on top of an old department store. To get to your room requires 2 different elevators and a hike across the lobby. Pity of you arrive by car; NO PARKING ; NO CAR DROPOFF.No Taxis either at most times!Getting luggage in and out of the place is next to impossible. The restaurant is way undersized and gets overrun during peak periods; better use one of the local coffee shops (also less $$$).####[['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
good place My trip had been horrible until this point, but the room was a great oasis from a day of delays. The Bar downstairs also had good food although the service was not quite as up to par, pretty slow for the small amount of people that were there. The shuttle bus was the key- they run all night!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
A good stay A three day stay on business . Got a good rate at $129 per night. Nice clean and spacious room, must have been upgraded recently - good standard of furnishings, LCD TV with HD channels.

Give It A Miss The hotel is in a great location, but I would have serious doubts in recommending the hotel as there are several deficiencies that need immediate attention. Hotel is in need of some seious maintenance i.e. broken counter tops, leaking taps, no self closing room doors, window locks not working and musty stench from stairwells. There is no parking at the hotel and runs $18 - $25 per day plus tax. No High Speed Internet access at all is available, you have to cross the road to a sister property's lobby and pay $10 a day. Had a bad experience with a rude staff member while checking out, but that hasn't swayed my review.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Gem of a hotel This is a particularly agreeable hotel with friendly staff, nice furnishings, and excellent value for money given the included breakfast, wine/cheese evenings, and coffee and tea on-tap, so to speak. Our petite double room was, as expected, space-challenged, but clever use of the available space minimized the bother, and for a 2-night stay it was not a problem. For longer stays, I would invest in a larger room. Particularly appreciated was the ability to set up my laptop and connect to the internet for free without having to re-arrange the furniture, unplug lamps, and so on (which is so often the case at more expensive hotels).The lounge on the 2nd floor is a lovely space to relax, and the bar on the top floor is also worth a visit (or two).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Loved the Millenium Biltmore This hotel was great! My husband and I booked here, after realizing the cost was so great for what you get. There is so much nostalgia and ambiance here. They have a quaint little jazz bar with great service, and the only true dissappointment was the parking fee, but it is downtown LA.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Great value, great location, friendly staff and loads of character Stayed for one night at the end of a business conference.

Ideal base for a night... Only stayed the one night, as part of the extension to our Minicruise, and thought it was quite an alright hotel, considering it wasn't too expensive.

Would return to the hotel again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral']]
Great Room, Good location! We stayed here and would recommend. This hotel has a ultra modern interior which we liked. Check-in was ok as we had an upgrade to a suite which was a nice surprise, It was a fantastic room, actually it was more like an apartment,, it was that big!

Great value for money and one stop from Hollywood Myself and three of my friends stayed at this Hotel as part of a miniature Californian tour. It was clean, the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway. The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood. There is a five minute walk to the subway/rail station and then one stop and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre, this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel. Overall this Hotel provides clean accomodation and serves perfectly as a base for those who wish to go out drinking in Hollywood.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Excellent Boutique Hotel We selected the Hotel Elysee for our 10 year Anniversary. We have stayed at other upscale hotels in the city but liked the warmth and the intimacy of this property.

(Leave extra time for the bellman to hail you one!!!)We will definately return to this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Nice quiet area, A very nice little hotel in a good, fairly quiet area. Close to the river, within walking distance of lots of places of interest, and handy for underground, buses and small shops/restaurants.

Contemporary Elegance We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is only one block from the beach and in the heart of everything else there is to do in South Beach.

Simply Fantastic location A really fantastic hotel in a stunning location just two minutes walk from the Rialto bridge. The hotel is modern, spotlessly clean and welcoming and the staff were very friendly and willing to help. Our bedroom was delightful and very luxurious, a real haven of warmth and comfort.

Best Place To View Mardis Gras There have been a number of times we have had Reunions of our ship in New Orleans and always stayed at the Le Parc and at Mardi Gras always had a room on the second floor and when after viewing so many parades would go the the room and would hear the Beads hitting the window. Was a shipmate of Tommie Lupo and I'm glad he died before the Devastation of N'Awlins####[['hotel general', 'positive']]
Excelent experience Well desrving of its four-star rating. Excellent accommodations and service, friendly staff. My only quibble is the lack of grab bars for the disabled in the bathroom and the lack of a bathroom night light.

Good-sized clean rooms but service could be improved We booked a standard room at the Villa Mazarin. We found it centrally located (we walked to most of the major tourist sites) and the rooms were decent sized and comfortable. What let it down somewhat for us was the service at the front desk - they were by no means rude, but made you feel like you were bothering them if you asked them any questions. If the service were more personable and efficient, then we would have had no complaints about the Mazarin.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Good hotel, good location Stayed here for a few on nights on way to Sydney in November 04. Like a lot of other reviewers, i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn't be spending too much time there. Staff were friendly and helpful and some good info from the tourist desk. About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay, but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable (buy an Octupus card at the airport!).Tremendous, mainly unrestricted views over Hong Kong, harbour and Kowloon from the rooftop pool. Restaraunt a bit pricey, but reasonable value European/Asian buffet breakfast. No problems at night with karoke - although Bridge Over Troubled Water in Cantonese is interesting.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

School Group I brought a group of middle school students to stay here on June 3-6, 2004. The stay was fantastic.

Mediocre cleaning, mediocre breakfast buffet Was not asked about room preference at check-in and got one stinking with old cigarettes. Happily we were offered a non-smoking room within 30 minutes after we complained. The glasses and cups we used in the room were not changed by the cleaning lady, just wiped off.

weekend at the westin this is a very nice hotel in a very good location in downtown dallas.the beds were soft.the shower was a heavenly shower with very good water pressure.the towels were very thick and soft.no pool.the only bad thing about this hotel is that it is connected to the plaza of the americas office complex which is closed on the weekends.so all of the shops are not open.there is an ice skating rink that is open for limited skating.pay the $20 for valet parking unless you plan to drive to other parts of dallas.the dart train is only about 2 blocks from the front door.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

A hotel to return to in San Francisco, CA The location is perfect for the business man or the leisure traveler with walking distance to Union Square or a one block pickup on a historical trolley.

Great Service and accomadtions At the time of our arrival we were greeted by a very friendly doorman. After a very pleasent check in we were taken to our room by the bellman. He infromed us of all the services avavilable at the hotel. We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel's restaurant followed by after dinner drinks in the lounge. Next time we come to San Francisco we will stay at the Omni again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Loved the Halekulani Spent over a week at the Halekulani in February, what a wonderful hotel. Friendly staff, beautiful room and peaceful surroundings. The beach area is nonexistent, but the pool is just beautiful. Be sure to get the sunrise package - The House Without a Key  Orchids both serve an excellent breakfast. I recommend a visit to the hotel's spa as well.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Loved this hotel I stayed here recently with my 2 sons (ages 9  11). The hotel is perfectly located near the museums and leidisplein. The staff is awesome - extremely friendly and professional.

Superb! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights (and mornings and afternoons) at Matteo's beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal. His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated, and treat each other, like old friends. The wonderful terrace, for breakfast and evening spritzers and whatever else you'd like, provides the remarkable setting. Although near the Rialto bridge, serenity reigns. Al Ponte Antico is a magical place and we will return again and again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money. The hotel was within walking distance of Alexanderplatz where there is a very efficient metro system serving most areas of Berlin. In the evenings we visited some bars within walking distance of the hotel but admittedly hard to find which were open very late. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]

Elegant serene I went back a second time this summer because I loved this small, chic and most restful of hotels.

Great hotel, ok location The rooms were lovely and the breakfast great. Convenient location for getting around Barcelona on foot.

Highly Recommended We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and found this to be the perfect choice. Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
good hotel The Sheraton was a good hotel to stay at. I will stay again next year when we go back to Boston. We booked a room in the south tower because of reading this site.

Fantastic pools, shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008, and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely. 3 pools - one infinity, one with a pool bar and a spa pool. The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn't actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach (about 5 - 10 minutes). All, in all though this is a good holiday hotel and the staff were always very friendly.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Golf Ball Soap... This is a great hotel for the price. It has a free mini bar with coke and beer.

Excellent I stayed here for 1 night on 20 Feb 07 whilst on business. Although outside is not particularly special my twin bedded room was excellent. Spotlessly clean and large, with seperate power shower, bath and loo with bidet. All staff were extremely welcoming and polite, especially the English 'bellboy' working 7-15h.

Highly Recommend Victoria 4 Victoria 4 is well located, near Plaza de Sol, about half-way between the Prado and the Royal Palace, and a short walk to the Gran Via. There are many restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. The hotel staff was helpful, the room sufficiently large, clean and quiet. The lobby is somewhat small. The breakfast, which was included, was more than satisfactory for a continental breakfast.

A really lovely hotel in a lovely district close to all Hotel Monge was a lovely place to stay - really great value for a long weekend to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Staff were very helpful, location amazing and metro so close - although Notre Dame and Latin Quarter was only 15 minutes walk. Mouffetard was a lovely district up very closeby, with great bars and restaurants - we loved 1001 Nights Morrocan bar with hooker pipes and Avocado milk shakes! The market at Mouffetard on Sunday was gorgeous - cheese meat fish coffee veg chocs baked goods....... etcetcetcAny way this was by far the best value stay in Paris, and saw some gorgeus quieter quarters as well as the main sights.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Vacation!! My friends and I spent a week at the Marriott in San Juan and we loved it!! We enjoyed the beach and the hotel itself and had tons of fun!

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great hotel, excellent location We (a group of 10) stayed at the H10 Marina in June 2008 on a hen weekend, and I would highly reccomend this hotel. It is clean, well kept with minimalist modern decor and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The location is also great, about 10 minutes walk from the bars at Port Olympic. The pool area is quite small, so if that is a priority for you it may not be ideal, but as we didn't have time for sunbathing that was no issue.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Excellent hotel but can get expensive Hotel was clean and service was excellent. Restaurants in the motel are expensive so go out to eat. Hotel is classy with a beautiful lobby and front desk area. Beach area is shared with other hotels so it can crowded early. We do not recommend the dinner cruises, they are over rated and over priced, do a luai instead. Hotel is recommended and if you get room 1609 you will have a good ocean view without paying for it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Enjoyed the Orchard Experience Booked this Hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The Hotel is small but very reasonably priced for the area. The rooms are very comfortable and we had great nights sleep, didn't eat in hotel as was abit pricey for our liking, they did recommend very good eating places nearby that suited our requirements perfectly. Overall we were very pleased with this accommodation, and would choose to stay here again. The Cable Car is very handy but quite expensive to travel on single trips, so get a long term or multi trip ticket from the start.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Beware of leaving cash in the gift shop for postage. Very pleasant experience with one exception. The gift shop stated they out of postage and if I would leave cash, the stamps would be purchased at the post office and my post cards would be mailed for me. I had a number of cards and left the saleslady approximately equivalent of $14+ US dollars for the postage. While cards mailed from other locations across China, arrived at their destinations, not one of the cards left in the hotel gift shop were ever received.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]

Great value for money Great value for money if you can get a discounted rate. Pretty good location. It's rated 3.5 (or 4 star) but it's more like a 3 star.

My base in Hong Kong There are plenty of good comments about this hotel already posted here on Trip Advisor. This is a well run, clean and nicely appointed hotel that is very handy for the airport as well as being only a few stops on the MRT to Central Hong Kong. The hotel is attached to a newly built shopping centre. If you can live without the hussle and bussle of a city centre then this hotel is a good option. I am in Asia 6 or 7 times a year and use this property as my base from which I then travel in and out from the nearby airpor####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
reviews are spot on excellent location - restauarants and bars are all on the street right in front of the hotel.sites very easily accesible with both the u bahn and s bahn right outside the door.we didnt have breakfast - its 15 euros but if book day before its 11. To be honest though, once you have found a place to eat, ordered juice, coffee and say crambled eggs you have pretty much spent that anyway so it is probably worth it as its a buffet.bar in hotel nice to start in or have a drink before bed.if you stay in the front of the hotel - the windows are transparent!we stayed with two children and hotel was fi####[['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Realy nice hotel, enjoyed staying there Really nice hotel. Modern, excellent beds, great location (even though is was near rembrandt square ti was very quiet), really helpful staff, breakfast ok, the bathroom was with glass walls so a little bit embarassing if you want your privacy.

The location is very close to the center, tram way is outside the hotel about 1 mins walk, and there is a bike hire place on the basement of the hotel which was very convenient as cycling is one of the easiest way to get around Amsterdam in the day or at night.

lub is great! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce,the concierge, that made our stay here more than comfortable. They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West (Binkley's) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert, they just could not do enough! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be, full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at. Would highly reccommend, but only in club.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Great Little Boutique Hotel! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations, excellent service by the hotel staff, and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel. Breakfast is served each morning, with a generous choice of bakery, meat, egg, fruit, and drink choices. While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town, we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites.

Such elegance! I loved The Kimberly! It's small, as hotels go, but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room. The parlor was comfortable, the kitchen surprisingly complete, and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed. The staff was delightful, especially the doorman, an older African American man, who was quick with a smile and never, ever gave me the feeling he was looking for a tip (which made me tip him more!).It's conveniently located to many midtown attractions and also the subway at 51st and Lexington. I would definitely stay here again, but word to the wise: make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day, even if you're only a minute or two late!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

 expensive for what it gives It's not really bad, but does not give value for money. When arriving at SFO airport, I called the shuttle line and was told that it would take about 10-12 minutes. I have seen all other hotel shuttles twice, before the Sheraton one arrived. The staff is friendly enough. I had diner there too, which was quite good, but the temperature in the restaurant was rediculously hot.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'negative']]

Decent with good quality/price ratio, but noisy The hotel is in a good location, the rooms, at least the low priced one i got, are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there. The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm. I tried to put the room temperature regulation on, but the fan was really noisy, so i opted for an extra blanket. My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings. On the average, i would suggest this place, at least for the cheap rooms, to the budget conscious traveler.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

firmed reservation, but no room available when we arrived I reserved two rooms several months in advance and confirmed them via email one week before arrival. Nonetheless, we were apologetically told by the staff that they had overbooked and had no rooms available and were transferring us to its sister hotel Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon Hotel rooms turned out to be run down, with stained upholstery, linens, and carpeting, no air conditioning, and an old, lumpy bed. We found a new hotel. I never saw the rooms at the Regencia, so I can't comment on them (the lobby was simple but clean), but the experience was disappointing and stressful as we scrambled to find an acceptable hotel.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Fabulous place in Florence My sister and I spent seven days at IlGuelfoBianco in Florence and wish it had been longer. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.

The hotel is in a quiet zone in the centre of Berlin, 15 min. walk to Potsdammer Platz with e.g. the Neue Nationalgalerie and a 15 min. walk to the Ged盲chtniskirche.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Place to Vacation! I thought it was very nice there where only 3 things i would watch out for : People with a royal shirt they try to sell you stuff, the vendors they chase after you so you will buy there stuff and the costant music playing but other than that it was great the beach is lovely the pool is a perfect temperature and the swim up bar is great! I would definitely go back.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Great business trip Last week, I stayed in the Hotel Le Cirque in New Orleans because I had an event over there. It surprised me with the great service and kindness of the staff. There is one guy who helped us, Mike, he is very nice. They tell you how to get to places, and also the hotel is so clean, which is what I look for in a hotel. I definetely recommend it.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week, and the experience was completely delightful: perfect location (on the river, an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio); friendly, attentive staff; spotless, attractive rooms; and an excellent (hot) American breakfast. Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms. My single room, which I referred to as the princess room, since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping/bath area after you came in the door, had no view, but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade-off. The size of the hotel was perfect, with a boutique atmosphere. I loved Florence, and will hope to have the opportunity to return and enjoy the Berchielli again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Great Location, Great Staff, Rooms a little Small (but hey, it's Paris) The location was great (facing the Pantheon, close to the Metro) and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll stay again nexy time we're in Paris. The only minor negative is that the rooms are awfully small (huge beds make it even worse). You can pay more and get larger rooms so that may be a good option. All in all we had a great stay and recommend this hotel to anyone.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Excellent value I stayed at the Affinia Dumont on my third business trip to New York, and this is the best hotel value for the money in NYC or anywhere else. It's perfect for those wanting to mix business and pleasure thanks to an enormous desk and Aeron chair as well as a lovely looking spa (I just used the yoga room one morning). Also a well-equiped fitness room, which I didn't need because I walked 6 to 10 miles a day! The elements that made this a standout for me were the excellent lighting (including some energy-efficient fixtures)--especially the reading lights over the bed, over the desk, and by the reading chair--and the great mirrors everywhere you could possibly want them. Overall, including its fully equipped galley kitchen, it's larger than some NYC studio apartments!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Absolutely beautiful and chic hotel I stayed here in Feb of this year with two friends of mine, a girly trip! And i was very impressed by my stay. The hotel was so gorgeous and modern. They serve the best caesar salad! Also I left a pair of new jeans in the wardrobe and when I contacted them on my return to Dublin they posted them to me free of charge, nice touch! Would definitely go back there.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Happy -- Again Having booked a standard room for our second long weekend at Ku鈥檇amm 101, we were positively surprised to be given a comfort room for the same price. The young staff was very friendly and helpful, again. When the going gets tough in the breakfast room though, the service isn鈥檛 always up to speed.

Expensive but worth every cent What a lovely hotel. I arrived after a difficult trip from Milan to the comfort, luxury and top flight airconditioning of the hotel Gallery Art (an essential in the middle of August).In contrast to other Italian hotels I experienced, the staff were consistently delightful and superbly helpful at all times. The location is unsurpassed being right on the Arno and next to the Ponte Vecchio. I unhesitatingly recommend it and will stay nowhere else when I return to Florence.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
3 stars hotel... dream hollidays or a nightmare? if you want to go to Punta Cana choose another hotel to stay.

Great Resort Despite the coldest weekend in 16 years, we had a FABULOUS time at the JW Desert Ridge and barely realized that it was raining and even SNOWING in AZ! The JW did a wonderful job with service and addressing every need we had, and we were impressed from the valet attendant to the bellman to the room service! The grounds were beautiful and well maintained, and there were significant challenges given the temperature changes there. Truly a wonderful experience and would recommend this resort to anyone...that I like!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
The best. We booked this hotel at the last minute - and what a pleasant surprise. It is more expenseive than we would usually pay - but it was worth every penny.

Good location and nice hotel The hotel is located at the Bugis Junction which is quite handy for some local cuisines. The room is good and the club floor lounge is very nice.

Noisy... I must admit the Hotel Fusion is a great bargain in a great location. My room was large but basic. My only compaint is that while they went to great lengths to renovate the hotel they overlooked one detail, insulated windows. I was on the 4th floor and the street noise penetrating into my room overnight was almost unbearable. I am not a light sleeper and if you are I would recommend staying somewhere else.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Excellent I stayed there with a mate having arrived after 15hrs on planes from New York, Madrid and Barcelona. The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the start, with plenty of charm and good humour (which we found unusual in Spain on the whole)! Rooms were very clean and well maintained. It's in a great location for the night-life (ramblas) and was within easy walking distance of good bars, resturants, and other attractions. I'lld recomend this mainly for younger people, singles or couples as the nightlife in the immediate area is vibrant to say the least. Overall, a great hotel with excellant service, presentation and modern amenities, would stay there again without doubt.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Good location, comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side, the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this. All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15-20 mins to Museumplein. Near to metro, trams and canalbus stops. Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work (both to us and the hotel) which the hotel kindly compensated us for. Would definitely stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
very good experience at this hotel Stayed for 2 nights while touring through Texas. Located to the north of the city but convenient for attractions (if you have a car). we did the JFK museum in downtown Dallas before heading over to Fort Worth Stockyards and then to Southfork Ranch so you can do these attractions in a day from this base. Nice restaurants and other facilities. Excellent well appointed room at very competitive rate.

Elegant Hotel, excellent position, but some minor flaws We stayed here in late September 2003, and would recommend it for position, and its effortless elegance and style. A five minute walk from the Duomo and various excellent side-street restaurants make it a very strong choice. That said, those minor flaws: as in other hotels, rooms vary in quality from tired and jaded to newly refurbished with Tuscan pain effects - so negotiate for the better ones. Breakfast was mediocre with catering being run by an outside conmtractor! Be prepared to part with $25 a day for parking as well. But overall the setting- especially the roof-top bar terrace - gave this a very strong rating.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Fine but pricey stayed here for a long weekend - nice hotel and obviously can't beat the location - we were in the castle club which is worth the extra money as had 'character breakfasts' every morning - that way you can gets lots of photos and avoid eating in the hotel for lunch and dinner - had the buffet at the Inventions restaurant one night which was awful - go up to the Disney Village if you want to eat something decent for half the price - there is a planet hollywood and a few other acceptable chains in the village - good standard of room but OD'd on the air freshner - very comfy beds - staff were fine - kids loved the weekend though which is the whole point - still considering the cost could make a better effort to feed the grown ups####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
blissful retreat It was a while ago, but we adored Uma Sapna. Having our own pool was fabulous. On the downside it IS quite a long walk from the beach/restaurants etc, especially in the dusty heat.

Great place to stay We have now stayed at the Nob Hill Motor Inn three times and have been there several nights each time we were in San Franscisco. We have never been disappointed.

Great stay I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous.

A great hotel that I would happily stay again in.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Fantastic Palace Just back from a long weekend over Paddy's day and this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in.

Loved the Cambridge We stayed at the Cambridge Suites Hotel for a weekend. The rooms were spacious and clean with a big and very comfortable bed. We were upgraded to a room on the 21st floor and had a great view of the city. We had complimentary breakfast included which, while basic, was adequate. The location is also fantastic as it is one block from the Eaton Center and other attractions of the city.

OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area, however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy, didn't get too much sleep during our stay. Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom. The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say, which was further than I had originally thought, but it was easy to find our way around. Didn't have breakfasts at the hotel. Used the garden area, but not the pool although it did look very tempting, but the weather wasn't really warm enough.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Friendly, helpful staff The best part of Casci is the staff. They were very helpful with recommendations- directions, restaurants, etc. This was our second hotel in Florence, and compared to the first, Casci had a little more of a hostel kind of feel- signs in the bathroom asking you not to clean your laundry in the sink, for example. This was the quietest of all hotels we stayed at, which was nice. The location was great- down the street from the Duomo, street markets, and within walking distance of the train station.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Avoid at all costs How this place can call itself a 4.5/5 star hotel is beyond me - obviously the management have no grasp of hospitality unless they previosuly ran a prison or similar. Room wasn't clean, service non existent bordering on don't care attitudes, I can honestly say that I have had better experiences in BBs. Dreadful, simply dreadful. Avoid - I'd suggest a tent if this was the only place left to stay in NSW!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
lean but Noisy Reasonably clean, great location by attractions but horrifically noisy, both from street traffic and denizens of the hotel itself. Staff was very nice. Room cleaning products very smelly, so be careful if you are sensitive. Parking an issue - not enough spots by the end of the day. Bottom line: because it was so much less expensive than any other property in the area (approximately $100/night less) we would likely stay here again if we couldn't find a better deal elsewhere.####[['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Nice place to stay The Residence Michalangiolo has fantastic rooms, and is run by the nicest freindliest people you could hope to meet. It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service. As there is no restarant and bar if you are hoping to meet other guests this hotel is not for you, but with a hotplate and fridge cleverly hidden in the room it is great if you want to do your own thing. You can drink your own drinks on a terrace or in the garden.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
I liked the Mosser The Mosser is a very clean, comfortable, friendly, attractive hotel that's in a great location in San Francisco. It's also inexpensive.

If you're OK with that, definitely stay at the Mosser.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]

Loved It After reading the reviews on this site, I was terrified of my choice, but had already paid in full through Expedia. The hotel turned out better than I expected and I completely relaxed. Room was charming, although it was the absolute smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in, and the bathroom was really itty bitty!Didn't have much contact with the staff, but what contact I did have was pleaseant. I arrived at the hotel at 11 a.m. was allowed to check in, which helped me enjoy a full day in San Francisco without worrying about check in times, etc. I took Bart from the airport and highly recommend it over taking a $40 or more taxi ride.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Avoid like the Plague Have traveled to Amsterdam over 10 times and never stayed in anywhere so TERRIBLE. The rooms were tiny (2 beds in 1 room and 3 in another). The bed was for someone aged 5 or under and the views of a concrete wall were awful. After checking out i was told i had to clean my own room which i did and then 1 week later was charged and extra 150 euros for what i don't know.

Great if it weren't for the desk staff Beds, location and cleanliness were excellent. HOWEVER, the front desk screwed up a simple Kinkos delivery for me, and my traveling companion's reservation- then tried assigning blame on him despite his ability to produce confirmation numbers and dates. All ended well, but customer service was AMAZINGLY bad.

On the basis of the reviews on this site we booked the Alicia and were not disappointed in the least.

Also really quiet due to very good double glazing - so between the quietness and the comfortable bed I had a fantastic night's sleep. Bar area - friendly.

great location close to amenities, but nice and quiet on an evening. could do with a good clean and a lick of paint. rooms very basic but hey your only sleeping in them. if you have problems with stairs this is not the hotel for you. staff very friendly and helpful.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
MICE PROBLEMS The W Hotel has really gone downhill since its change of owners. Used to be an okay hotel with balinese style decor. Now the decor looks old and is in need of updates, they have scimped on wait help so the service is extremely bad and THEY HAVE MICE PROBLEMS! A bit scary as we were coming home from dinner one night, a small little creature went scurrying across the floor to our horror! Do not stay here.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
very bad hotel Very Good location but very very very bad hotel. The breakfast was not good. Allot off noise from the pipe in the room. Very Noise room.

Okay for the money... Stayed at the Hotel Accademia for 3 nights in mid November 2004. The room was decent, clean and relatively quiet. The bathroom was huge by Italy standards and very updated.

Fabulous We stayed at the fantastic Raddisson SAS Berlin over the New Year 04/05 and it's simply one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!! As soon as you walk in, the aquarium just stuns you with its beauty and size! The staff are attentative and polite and the rooms are superb! The LCD tv's really make a difference and the room design and the 'wet room' style bathrooms are great. The spa is also one of the best! All in all, I have no hesitation in reccomending this wonderful hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Not the worst hotel ever... ... but nothing special. The hotel is very dated and dingy, with a funky smell throughout. Room was tolerable but not the cleanest. Way overpriced for what it was. If you just need a place to sleep and don't plan to spend any time in the room, it might be fine, otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra. I highly recomend this quaint, perfectly located hotel. just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno, the location is perfecto. More importanly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The service stands out as some of the best I have experience-the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals. Be sure to chat with the delightful and engaging Monti-his Joie de vivre is infectious and he is loads of fun.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
getting better Having stayed here for the 3rd or 4th time over the years I have to say the Rho is getting much better. The rooms seem to have had a touch up and now appear much cleaner and brighter.

Good airport hotel Nice hotel close to the airport. Our room was on the top floor and was a non-smoking room that was still a little stuffy (smokey?). I stayed at this location about 8 years ago for the first time. Overall, this hotel has been well managed/maintained over the past years. I would recommend it if you have a late arrival or early departure. It also has a nice breakfas####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Overall good, but too expensive Overall it was a good hotel, but I think too expensive. Good:- great breakfast for the money (it was only 6.50 euro for booking online)- big room and the expected comfort for a 3 star hotelBad:- quite far from city center and metro station- too noisy (situated on a big street)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative']]
xcellent I was in Barcelona in July. I am a travel agent and I usually stay at the Arts. Th Diplomatic has excellent service. I reserved it through Ac hotel web site for 125e. The mini bar is free.

Loved Alam Kulkul We stayed our last night in Bali at Alam Kulkul, as soon as we entered the room, we liked it, even though our room was on the very last corner , but the atmosphere inside was homey, it was not modernly designed or looked new, but very comfortable. I think it was because the room was bright. We also tried their Jamu Spa treatment : Hot Stone massage and Warm tea leaves Facial which was divine. We definitely will come back to Alam Kulkul in our next trip to Bali, and that time we would like to try their villa, which we're sure that is well groomed too, just like their hotel room. We highly recommend alam kulkul to everyone.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Good choice for central location Clean with nice decor and reasonably large rooms. Excellent location about 10- minutes walk from Barri Gothic and 15minutes from the SAngria Familia. The hotel is great as a base base to visit the sites or even if you are there on business ( free internet connection) . However there are few facilities outside the room and the food (breakfast only) is very limitted in range and quality- for 6 euros you would be much better visitting on of the many local cafes.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative']]
Not so charming It was nice that the hotel had an old charm feeling but underneath it all it was run down and dirty. The girls staying next to me found cochroaches in their bathroom. Our room did look into a small bricked in hallway that was a bit strange. I had to have my door card reactivated every time I came into the hotel for 5 days straight which became very annoying.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Hotel Carton review Booked a room at this hotel for a great price after reading some good reviews on TA. Staff were very pleasant, rooms were clean and modern, location was great, although one wrong turn and you could end up near the tenderloin, although to their credit, the staff at the hotel tell you this immediately. When you check in, they give you a map, and tell you exactly where not to go, so you really have no excuses. However, as said before, the location is great and you're close (walking distance) to some great places. Recommended!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fabulous Classy Hotel This is a fantastic hotel, Reception were so friendly, supplied us with maps and even highlighed places of interest. The breakfast is lovely and very varied. The rooms are beautiful, spotlessly clean. The pool and roof bar are lovely and give you fantastic views of the cityOnly slight negative is there are bars beside the hotel, it's not soundproofed enough so the sound carries and can disturb you through the night. Highly recommend this hotel if you fancy a relaxing base for sightseeing!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Wonderful Staff, Great Place On a sold-out summer weekend day (Saturday July 28, 2007), we found ourselves in big trouble because of a misunderstanding of the room type at the time of online reservation. The hotel staff went out of their way to resolve the situation to our satisfaction. The stay in this place was great. This Hotel is located within a block of Seattle center/Space Needle, and is within a 2 mintue monorail ride or a short drive from downtown/ Pike Market area. The room and particularly the beds are very comfortable, and the breakfast is quite good. This is a friendly place with good location and plenty of free parking space.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
not too shabby sharing a room with a pal, it cost us 拢2 each per night which is really quite reasonable for a nice hotel. beds were comfy and food was nice. staff were a little rude though and beer was about 拢4.50 a pint.

Great trip, great hotel This is a great hotel - it was superbly located by the flower market and the staff were all extremely friendly. The room was clean and the shower was the best I've ever found in a hotel. Because it was so centrally located it was little noisy at night but it wasn't a real problem.

perfect Me and my wife came from Iceland to Barcelona to celebrate her birthday and chose the Pulitzer. From now on this is our hotel in Barcelona. I booked a romantic/celebration stay and it was perfect, from a bottle of Cava waiting in our room which was spacious and welcoming to booking a perfect meal at Quatre Gats restaurant. When we came back from the meal a hot bath was waiting for my wife with cava, strawberries and chocolate and the room decorated with roses, perfect. Front desk and all staff was perfect, they organised a masseuse to come to our room for a deep and relaxing massage for my wife. We will certainly stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Perfect stay was a bit concerned after reading mixed reviews but would highly reccomend this hotel, we were upgraded to sea front view and as it was my 30th birthday they had a complimentary cake waiting for me in my room!! the hotel staff could not do enough, very accomodating. The breakfast was amazing and it was lovely sitting out in the early morning sun to eat it. Rooms very spacious, comfy beds and the bathroom was out of this world, only problem we did have was we did have to ask for the room to be made up after returning as it had not been done, but this was then done immediately.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

just the ticket I stayed here in 2004 for two separate stints of three nights each. Both times I was really appreciative to have a clean, safe, cool and relaxing place to stay. Overall I found the hotel simple but perfect for my needs. The pool is an added bonus for taking a moonlight dip under the lights of the surrounding skyscrapers - surreal!

Majestic indeed! I really enjoyed our stay here. We booked at a great rate and upon checking in, received a great room: corner with a balcony. The room was beautiful, the view from the balcony was great, and the bathroom had the best shower we have encountered so far in Europe.

single room double price I had booked a double room through a website, then I called to check if there was a single available as I was going to be on my own. They said fine, no problem, but don't bother to cancel the original booking. We'll take care of it when you arrive. When I got there I was given a very small room with just ONE single bed, so I expected a single room rate as well. But when I checked out I realized that was not the case. Single room, double price.####[['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
The view is worth the money Our decision to upgrade to a room in the tower with a bay view was worth every penny! And the room is extraordinary with fine linens, a fantastic bath (separate marble shower and soaking tub), a great radio, and delivery of the San Francisco Chronicle and the New York Times in the morning! We also enjoyed a nice dinner at Tonga.

Great Rooms, Noisy Location We spent 4 nights at this hotel in Madrid. The hotel itself is in excellent condition and our room was clean and very comfortable. You could easily walk to all the sights from this location, which made it convenient. The breakfast was top notch as was the lovely rooftop bar. The hotel staff were nice, but were not at all helpful in recommending restaurants. The downside of the hotel is that it is on a very noisy street and there are many very aggressive vagrants who lurk around the hotel, not to mention hookers who work the area in the evening.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

>If only other hotels can learn from this Omni Our family of four stayed at the Omni San Francisco for a too short 4-day weekend. We have stayed at a number of other hotels (including the Ritz-Carlton) over the years and can honestly say that this was the absolute best experience we have ever had.

My Birthday meal I havnt stayed at this hotel but while staying in Barcelona my wife took me to the Torres for a meal on my birthday. The views are astounding and we were given a table with excellent views of the Magic Fountains which started performing at 21.00 hrs and the show was spectacular. The food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpfull and also very knowledgeable about the menus, wine and food. I am a qualifed Chef and my wife and I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world including what is listed as THE best restaurant in the world at the moment by renowned Chefs, The Fat Duck in Bray, UK and found the food and service in The Torres to be of an extremely high standard.

Rip off! Consumer beware! Arrived to find a depressingly hot, dank, tiny, shabby UNACCEPTABLE room for the $175+taxes. Although I agreed to pay their $50 cancellation fee, my credit card was charged $196.75 for NO services rendered. Surely they rented the room twice that night (April 20) and somebody pocketed some easy money!I want a refund.

already planning a 2nd trip we stayed at the Royal for a week this March and could not have been more pleased with the service. The hotel is beautifully kept, staff excellent. We booked with hotwire and had standard rooms, no bugs(!), and we want to return in 2 years for our 30th. The service in the Mai Tai bar could be slow, but we found the waiters to be more service minded than the waitresses, who thought they were too cute to move quick.

I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard. This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful. Maybe I got unlucky, but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics, I decided to leave the property all together. The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch. Although the bar is nice and the breakfast, the one day I did stay, was excellent, I've become accustomed to a higher standard and comfort from my room.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]

Not a 5 Star - Need refurbish This Hotel can NOT be considered as a 5 Star Hotel. The Bathroom was a old fashioned conditioned and the room seems like you were on the 80麓s.

Watertown Hotel -- Amazing! This place is a dream -- we had a great, spacious room. There's a funky, modern, upbeat feeling to the lobby and all of the public spaces.

The staff were VERY HELPFUL, even the manager offered to allow us to leave our big luggage there for a small trip to London. Also all staf spoke english, which was a big plus!!!! In fact the only reason I would return to Paris is because of the great service we got at the hotel and the pub next door, everywhere else seemed unfriendly and offered little help. Small tip the BREAKFAST is NOT INCLUDED, it's quite expensive at 12 euros.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
l hotel, great value Very nice in every way, cool decor, definitely above usual 3 star standard, we're used to 4 or 5 star hotels and this fit the bill. Roof top pool and bar area is lovely and amazing views, go up at sunset as the lights on the huge fountain nearby go on. Not central but right across from metro station and on bus route, travel is no problem and I'm a great believer in not having to walk, save that for Las ramblas! Do not miss the light and music show at the magic fountains round the corner, very memorable. Will definitely stay here again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great price and good location This motel has always been a favorite due to its location near Folsom Street and nightlife - but is even better now that its been given a AAA one-diamond rating and upgraded the rooms. Prices are good value even booking direct. Breakfast in the morning was good with bagels, etc. and decent coffee. 24 Hour staff was always helpful.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Loved the Clift Trendy hotel, centrally located in Union Square area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Loved the furniture in the lobby especially the tall high chair, check it out. The buffet breakfast was wonderful. Only complaint was the television in the room was too small. Otherwise, i definitely recommend this cool, chic hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Not a typical W W is not as good as other W's in other cities. I have stayed at several and though the SF version is nice, I don't think it measures up to W standards. Pricey, so so location and SMALL rooms. A little dirty and compared to other W's, awkward.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Great location, clean with helpful staff We booked for 4 nights in mid-September as we had previously stayed here 3 years ago. Since then the hotel has been given a face-lift. The rates were higher than normal (we booked through a NL hotel booking site online) due to a big conference taking place during the week but even though they were all busy, the staff were helpful and friendly. For an extra 25 euros a night you can upgrade on arrival to a superior room (50 euros for a deluxe) which is well worth doing if you can! We asked for a room at the front and found it was well sound proofed even though you had the trams and nightlife til late!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Not that bad the hotel is not that badi was staying there with my 5 friends and they gave us a 5-bed-room with private bathroom the room was not lovely, but absolutely good for sleeping after parties in Amsterdamthe best thing is its location - is in the very centry of Amsterdam, so everything is near... we appreciated it when we were returning from clubs (which are absolutely amazing there... )so dont be affraid of mice :))####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

Super hotel in great location A friend recommended that I use Trip Advisor to search online for hotels and I'm so glad I did.

This has to be a best kept secret Stayed at the St Marie from April 8 thru April 11, 2005. Accommodations were clean and comfortable. Room was spacious and overlooked the courtyard. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. Located 1/2 block off Bourban Street and 3 blocks from Jackson Square, it's close enough to the fun and far enough away from the smells and noise when you're through for the day.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Excellent Hotel This was my family's second stay at the Baglioni. The staff was quite helpful and the rooms were beautiful.

absolute rip off Pretty good by the book for the star rateing EXCEPT the HOWARD JOHNSON part. I was charged more for an international call that lasted barely 1 minute to Australia by the HOWARD JOHNSON organisation than I paid for the room!!!!!!! Beware local calls dialed through the hotel system are very inexpensive BUT by the telephone in the room are instructions to make international calls useing your credit card. I did this, the conections are made thru US, thru the HOWARD JOHNSON org. and that as far as I'm concerned is a RIP OFF.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years. In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags. The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening, did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them, begging to be let in. The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities, as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk. Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided.####[['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Loved Le Pavillion We go to New Orleans frequently for business and for pleasure. This was the first time that we had stayed at Le Pavillion. It was wonderful! The staff was personable and professional. The room was a little small, but if you are in New Orleans you are not in your room that much. I can definitely say that Le Pavillion will be our hotel of choice from now on.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Beyond 5 stars I am 57 years old and have travelled extensively and stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the Drake Hotel now sits at the top of my list. From the moment I arrived until I left, my stay was beyond my wildest expectations - absolutely fabulous hotel, room was amazing and a staff that went above and beyond what one could imagine.

Rather Disappointed! Dear Reader,after our recent one night stay at the Bali Hyatt, we unfortunately have to confirm the negative review written by LukePerth dated Nov 18, 2008. Our room was very humid and loud, which may relate to the structural set-up of the hotel property. We think that it could be worthwhile to invest some more $$$ and stay at the Sheraton Laguna Beach Resort in Nusa Dua.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Very good hotel We booked this hotel for the last night of our vacation using our Marriott rewards points. We didn't expect much but it actually turned out great. The bed was comfortable, the room was nice and the restaurant nearby they suggested at the front desk was excellent. We used the computer to map our way to a few places and were able to use the printer there for free.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Above Average Hotel Stayed for three nights in June 2005. Slightly overrated. While the rooms were clean and modern (plasma t.v., purified water in the bathroom), they are very small. Hotel guests are mostly white Americans, not that that is a bad thing but being in the hotel, you would never know you were in China (except for the staff). Great location, excellent service, clean/modern facilities, good Western-style restuarant for buffet breakfast, luxury shopping within the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Nice Hotel Nice hotel to stay while on a girls getaway. Located just outside the French Quarter. It was a clean hotel, nicely decorated, however the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small, so if your traveling with 4-5 women you may want a larger room. It was about a 10 minute walk from the Quarter, which is not bad, but it was a bit scary at 2 in the morning. Quaint bar. For the great rate they charge it is worth staying.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

Good budget hotel I thought this was a good hotel for the money. It's clean, the staff were helpful and it is very centrally located. I loved having a fridge in the room cause I stocked that with some wonderful ham and cheese shortly after my arrival. I thought the breakfast was very good, and you don't need to get up early as they serve it until pretty late. There is also a computer for internet access which was helpful. Overall, I had a very good stay here.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Double Charged! While the hotel itself was nice, I was deeply troubled when the Hotel billed me twice for the 2 night stay. The nightly room rate was something like $290 and i paid $749.69 upon checking out. I was shocked therefore to find a separate charge to my Credit Card by the Arctic Club Hotel for an additional $658.28!! Calls to the Hotel have not yet received any response, I was merely directed to leave a message for the Hotel Management... I will not contemplate staying at this hotel again until they rectify their error and take steps to prevent its recurrence!####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]

Excellent location This hotel had an excellent location, near Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas. It was also convenient to get to/from the airport with the aerobus stopping at Plaza Catalunya. The rooms were very nicely furnished and quiet and you are greeted with a glass of cava upon arrival. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The only complaint we had was that our room was way too small. From the reviews it seemed that there are larger rooms available, so do ask for those if you can.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Warm memories of Hotel David We had a very nice stay for Christmas 2008 at the Hotel David in Florence, Italy. The staff's hospitality, the warmth of the hotel all decorated for Christmas, the happy hour next to the fireplace, the spacious clean rooms and wonderful freshly baked pastries for breakfast and Christmas Eve, all contributed to a very memorable visit to Florence. I highly recommend the hotel. You will be lucky if, at the height of the season, you manage to book a room in this hotel!I give it a rating of excellent for our overall experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Superb Hotel Stayed for 4 nights April 8-12th. Great staff - room was immaculate and more importantly, the bathroom was very clean. Price was extremely reasonable for a hotel 2 blocks from 42nd/Broadway (Times Square) ! Plasma TV was a nice plus. Although no inhouse room-service, there are LOTS of restaurants close by that are open late and will deliver right up to your room.

Will stay here again when in NYC The location is great, in walking distance to so much. The staff was wonderful and responsive to our needs.

Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me. I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are very helpful, professional and friendly.

A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted. Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station,bus and tram stops etc. One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution, we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Helpful staff and warm atmosphere My daughter and I stayed just one night at The Chesterfield and took advantage of the promotion found on the hotel's website that included a full breakfast. The hotel was warm, clean, safe and very British. Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as hot offerings from the kitchen; a real treat. Though not the least expensive room in the city, for about $200, it was, for two of us, worth every penny. Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Good Service but Loud The location is quite convienent with many good restaurants in the neighborhood. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. On dinner recommendations they were 4 for 4 and they greeted every request with a smile. The main negative is the room was very loud, although being from NYC it did not prevent me from sleeping. Also, the room was a bit small.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home. The avenue is about a ten minute walk from the station and allowed us to leave our luggage all day so that we could go round the city long before we could check in.

Barcelona Gem In the heat of Barcelona and the noise of the bustling city, this lovely little hotel was pure heaven, set right on the front of Port Vell, only 10 minutes from the beach, Las Ramblas and the Barri Gottic district, you really couldn't wish for a better location.

Best hotel in San Fransisco Stayed in The Argonaut on our honeymoon, everything was new, clean and well furnished - staff were really helpful and the hotel felt luxurious.

ok, but not great Given the reviews, we were expecting more than the Lazy Parrot turned out to have to offer. The room was ok, but needed updating and we never did get hot water in the shower.

Good value weekend break When we stayed, they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money. We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel. Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times. Good location in a quiet area and convenient for buses and trains.

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel, or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service, a very modern and up to date decor, large and comfortable rooms, all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops. The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11.00am just in case we'd had a late night, a sun terrace on the roof with a (small) pool and gymnasium, although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife. Its great value for money and if you are looking for a safe bet, with good service and a convenient location look no further####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
One of the Best Hotels in Asia We have traveled all over asia, and not many of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at were as nice, attentive, and beautiful as this one. The concierge was very helpful, room service wasn't extremely overpriced, and the front desk staff was excellent. The room was BEAUTIFUL, it had the best furnishings out of any room I have ever stayed at. We were staying in the basic room for 107 a night, and were amazed.

Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel, three great pools to choose from. My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials, we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade, 75$ resort credit,  complimentary bottle of wine. I would recommend a little restaurant right down the street called Hacienda, we got breakfast there almost every morning for like 7 bucks a person it was really good food with an excellent view!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]

Weekend to remember We, my fianc茅 and I, stayed in this lovely hotel for the weekend, the weather was terrible however it did not seem to bother us. And it was all thanks to the wonderful people and atmosphere in this hotel. We had the normal 2-person chamber, but there was nothing normal to it. The whole decoration was stylish and very comfortable. We had all we need it! I want to say thanks to the persons working at the Roemer Hotel for making this a weekend to remember!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Wonderful place to stay! We were two women (older) traveling alone. We can not say enough good things about this hotel.

lean and basic but service was good We stayed (my wife, young son and myself) during late October. Rooms are a little tired but clean and the bed was surprisingly comfortable.

>what a pleasurable stay stayed at the marriot san juan resort and casino, excellent hotel, clean, and the staff was very helpful. stayed there 3 days prior to a cruise and will return again. the best part was the nightly salsa band and dancing, in the hotel lobby. the room was clean, bed comfy and beachfront clean and quiet. will return agai####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
great location and good value We were pleased with our stay at the Hotel Kapiolani. It was only $83a night and for that price, it was clean, the location was great, thepool area was very nice as well as the lobby. We stayed only 2 nites,but it was just what we wanted for the extra time in Hawaii. You can walk one block and you are at the major Waikiki beaches and shops. It is not luxurious, but I would stay there again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

Good stay This hotel is located in one the better parts of Amsterdam and it shows. No busy streets, close to all important attractions Amsterdam has to offer and now weird people wandering around at night.

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton-family properties, and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay, it was hardly worth the price paid. Good points: very friendly staff, and terrific restaurantBad points: the room was dated - old rundown furniture, warped bathtub, stained bedding. I was only offered a double-queen suite in the main building, which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements. Overall, I've had much better accomodations at Embassy Suites and Doubletrees in the hilton family. Next time, I would stay elsewhere in the area, and just drive over to dine at the Different Pointe of View restaurant.####[['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great rooms The check in was extremely fast and friendly and we were even given a room upgrade which was a lovely surprise. There was some building work going on to the outside but other than a bit of dust there were no issues with thisThe room itself was immaculately clean and had a very contemporary and well thought out feel. The rain shower was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortableThe location was great, with easy walking access to all the major parts of the city.

Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown, with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links. Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean. Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit, and walls were on the thin side, but these were minor issues. Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good. Good food nearby at Changs (in Westlake) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place. Would gladly stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment, but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes, and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes, which improved the whole situation. The hotel is really quite plush, the rooms had everything we needed, and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free! The staff were very helpful, and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go. The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others,but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day, and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water, wasn't to be turned down. It is definitely a hotel I would visit again, particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki isn't great The location is good, right in Waikiki, close by the Honolulu Zoo, the price is one of the lowest online, but you really don't know what it really like till you stay here. They were in the process of changing the card key access, so we had to get new cards. There's two small swimming pools with astro turf, the room view was of the next building, the food in the hotel restaurant as the hotel itself was uninspiring. Threre's nothing really bad, just all second rate, and simply a disappointing experience to stay here. I wouldn't want to stay here here again nor can I recommend this place to anyone.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]

good hotel and location for price The hotel is located near central station so location is good for accessing transit and located near major attractions Didn't use the restaurant as there are millions of restaurants in this town.

A bit overrated Our stay at this hotel was okay, but I think the hotel is a bit overrated on the Internet. Our room was incredibly small and the view of the yacht harbor was decent but not spectacular. We ate breakfast at the hotel and while expensive, our server was very friendly and attentive. He was actually one of our nicest servers we had in Oahu. I think you could probably get more bang for your buck at one of the other area hotels.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral']]
Outstanding This hotel is beautiful. Wonderful classical Chinese furniture and the friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. The hot water is a bit slow, but that was the only problem. Obviously due to its converted-courtyard-house nature this hotel is far more suitable for a romantic holiday than a business stay!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral']]

Nice hotel with great location Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 3 nights from March 24-27.... The hotel is in a great location for exploring Amsterdam and steps away from bars/restaurants/shopping and grocery... The room was above average in size for Europe and the amenities were above average also... the bed was quite large and comfortable and the bathroom was large...there were even ice makers on every other floor!!!.... The restaurant was crowded and overpriced so we skipped it, but the bar was very entertaining and very busy at night.... Overall, I would stay here again at a reduced rate but not sure if it would be worth the cost at regular rates####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'conflict'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral']]
Shady I'd be careful with this hotel. I cancelled a reservation, was told all was fine, it's taken care of. A week and a half later a charge for this hotel shows up on my credit card. I called back to say that the reservation had been cancelled and they tell me that they have no record of me cancelling the reservation, you'll have to pay. So I'm responsible for someone not doing her job.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Excellent choice Excellent choice in Boston. Great location that is a few blocks from Copley Plaza, Newbury St. , etc. I expected more opulence in the lobby, but our suite was beautiful and perfectly maintained. Concierges and housekeeping went above and beyond at all times. There is a large and well-situated (view of Boston Common / Public Garden) gym and indoor pool. After our experience I would not consider staying anywhere else while in Boston.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Like old home week. My wife and I have been staying at Place d'Armes about once a year, sometimes oftener, for over twenty years, and continue to love the beautiful grounds and the wonderful people who maintain it.

Great City Centre Hotel Having just had a 3 night stay at the Park Plaza I can't understand why it gets such bad reviews. It is a typical city centre hotel and everyone should bear in mind that it is 80 years old and so doesn't have the modern look of some of the newer hotels in Boston. The staff were always happy to help, the room we had was large, very clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location for seeing all Boston has to offer. I would most definitely book here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

Heavenly hotel An oasis of calm and luxury in the heart of bustling Mong Kok. We stayed on the Club L floor which aside from having a gorgeous room with a great view of the city it meant we had a special personal check-in in Club L where there is a free internet den, massage chairs and unlimited food, drink, breakfast, afternoon tea for Club L guests. The whole hotel smells of gingerflower which was lovely and is connected to a huge shopping centre with loads of nice shops, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarket, cinema ... basically they make it hard for you to want to leave the building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Very comfortable beds; colourful and clean Great little hotel - a 50s motel that has been turned into a very pleasant hotel. The room was very clean and the bathroom ,although small was nicely decorated and also clean. Beds very comfortable and good aircon (if needed).The pool is not large but perfectly adeqhate for a refreshing dip after a long 10 hour flight from the UK!Breakfast was fresh pastries and bagels etc with coffee, juice and fresh fruit- eaten near the pool or back in rooms. Nice relaxed area and we walked to Fisherman's Wharf via a park and along the side of the bay - you can also take a bus from nearby.

Great, eccentric but click hotel I read one of the below reviews expecting the dylan to be past its prime after the changeover from ANoushka Hempel, shabby rooms, etc but was very pleasantly surprised. I went to amsterdam, a city i love and have visited many times for work and for pleasure, with a new partner - we were really surprised by the polite and professional (not at all snobby) service, great room service, great cocktails in the bar, and best of all, a great room. Booked a cheap (鈧?30) rate off the internet and was expecting a broom closet, but the room was very nice, large (by Amsterdam standards), loads of character, clean, kept-up-looking, just very very cool. I'd not hesitate to recommend the dylan especially as there are not too many options in AMsterdam for characterful, stylish hotels.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

Friendly, quirky and great location Rooms are nice but small. If you are a couple with a lot of luggage, you will be wondering where to put it with just 2 drawers and a narrow wardrobe in our Queen room. That said the staff were always friendly and helpful. The quirky object in the mini bar cupboard gave me an hilarious taking point at the conference I was attending at the Westin nearby.

Great hotel and great staff I stayed at this hotel this weekend and was really pleased I chose the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, all the staff could speak English (and were happy to), the location was perfect and the room was exceptionally quiet considering it was on a main road. The only down side to the hoetl was the size of the room. We stayed in a standard room and even though it was big enough for us it would have been nicer to have a slightly larger room. I would certainly return to this hotel if I return to Paris, the staff certainly and location certainly made a difference.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Perfect spot to enjoy Paris in the spring Nicely renovated hotel in a prime location right by the Eiffel, with bars, restaurants and shops all just seconds away.

xcellent stay Book this hotel back in August for a November stay,someone at the marriott hotel website made a mistake and had the web price for a two bedroom lakeview suite at $29.00 instead of $229. I jumped on it and booked it and thought I might get a hassle over it but instead the front desk staff were impressed at the rate I had recieved and happily checked me in. The staff were very friendly and the shuttle driver was excellent taking us to the downtown area whenever we needed him,of course a tip seemed to help with that.

Disappointing A business type hotel close to Sants station, convenient for access to the airport and the metro station for Barcelona's tourist spots. The rooms were spacious, clean and well kept. For breakfast there was a wide choice of food available but the organisation was dreadful and on the Saturday it descended into the farcical with guests queueing for upwards of 30 mins to get into the dining area. One further point, check your credit card bill carefully I found 40+ euros were charged to my credit card after we had checked out.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

Paper thin walls stayed at the stamford on sat 19.4.08 after dropping brother at airport, reception was friendly enough but room seems dated even after reno's and beds are hard and pillows terrible. the worst thing was the noise from the adjoining room which started at 12 at night till at least 3am rang reception and asked if they could do something about it which involved knocking on the door and being told by guests next door to [--] off and then giving up, was offered another room but as my 1 year old daughter had just gone to sleep after 2 hours of being kept awake by the noise i couldn't see the point i asked again for them to do something about the noise and the rang them and no change i rang again at 3 in the morning to be told there was nothing they could do about it and to see the duty manager in the morning.next morning at check out after no sleep i asked for the duty manager and told him my concerns, his reply was to offer free parking at a value of 10 dollars, i laughed as i thought he was joking after paying good money for no sleep he said the best he could offer was 2 free breakfast in there restaraunt which is about what soggy cold bacon and sloppy eggs are worth.for anyone wanting to stay at a decent hotel at the airport pick the holiday inn at least you might get a nights sleep.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative']]

Avoid the Radisson Waikiki Prince Kuhio Due to renovations 3 of the 5 elevators in this high rise hotel are out of service and have been since October, 2004.

Perfect for our lifestyle We weren't looking for anything fancy since we knew we'd be out on the town rather than in a hotel room during our trip, and this place fit us perfectly.

We couldn't have designed a more suitable place ourselves.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
great location Although it has been a few years since we visited this hotel, i would definately reccommend it as a no frills but clean, friendly, and centrally located hotel, if you are on a budget. The location is the best thing about it and i have to say i did feel safe walking about on my own during the day, when hubby was having his siesta! Remember to visit guell palace which is 1 or 2 side streets away from this hotel, it is an amazing building that can be overlooked by many tourists####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
mfort inn? Room was TINY for 4 people! The beds particularly were not really big enough for 2 adults!Breakfast was ok although a limited choice of toast or waffles or a few other random bits and bobs. Location was quite good, could walk up the hill for about 2 blocks to the crooked road or down the hill a few blocks and you get to the cable car. Reception were helpful and gave us directions to a great steak house!####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
good hotel overall it's a nice typical 5 stars hotel. the hotel is grand and nice, the room is great, the bathroom is nice. one thing which i don really like it's the pillow and the mattress, which is a bit soft for me. but overall i still like the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Great place to be I was there for a short 2 nights weekend break early November last year. Booked by the largest german tour operator. My booking was upgraded to a higher level business room, that means a larger room, newspaper every morning. You leave the hotel and stand in the middle of the bustling activity not far from the next MTR-stationsurrounded by shops. A recommendable hotel at all.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Less than expected We had reserved a 4 bedded room. Actually they put us in an apartment house adjacent to the hotel where renovations were taking place from early morning throughout the day.

Why go to Venice when you have Amsterdam The Ambassade is located on one of the most scenic and quiet canals in Amsterdam. Although our room was very spacious and located facing the canal, we found a bench on the corner where we would spend our evenings - relaxing and just soaking up the atmosphere before retiring for the evening. The hotel staff was very helpful and very courteous. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
fernce hotel Stayed during a conference. If you travel a lot, it's a pretty standard conference hotel. Good location connected to the Hynes Convention Center. I didn't use many of the services, but would say that the guest and meeting rooms are nearing time for renovation. Large rooms though. Good location.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Perfect 5-star hotel, but no 5-star palace Just passed three nights there. The 5 stars are justified by the quality of the bed, the size of the room, the choice of restaurants, the excellent noise protection, the impressive size of the lobby and the bar. The spa on the top floor is great: very clean, extremely friendly staff (like in the rest of the hotel). Noteworthy: it is the only really centrally located 5-star hotel in Frankfurt. Breakfast is OK, nothing very special for the high price it is.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Bargain and convenient location For years, I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only. The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room. The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front. if, like me, you juts need a place to sleep and shower, the beds could be better but the water has always been hot, and it is a bargain! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here, but I am barely in the room, so why pay more? I will be spending my 3rd vacation there in 2 weeks.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Don't arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor. I had a reservation for a room with a large bed. When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds. They did find a room with one large bed, in the smoking rooms, but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby. For 140 Euro, I expected a lot more. The next time I am in Madrid, I will find another hotel to stay in.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers. the room was perfect, great space which is unusual for New York, beautiful view, excellent location. The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor. The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly. But the reception area is really nice. So it is a good option to spend some in NY and feel at home but don't expect too much from the staff.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Very pleasant hotel Very nice hotel , 2 mins walk from London Bridge tube station, rooms exceptionally clean and very modern. Breakfast buffet lovely. Only drawback is cocktail bar in lobby is not really a nice atmosphere to have a drink and the pubs around the area all close on a Sunday.

Truly Impressive Everything you would expect from a new purpose-built city-centre hotel operating under the InterContinental brand. An impressive property, with deluxe accommodation. Stylish, contemporary, and well-equipped bedrooms, with well-designed lighting and modern bathrooms. Hotel locations in San Francisco can be hit and miss - this is certainly better than some, with Powell Street BART station and cable car terminus just a couple of blocks away. Good breakfast service in the ground-floor restaurant.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Time Square Treat Just back from a 6 night stay at The Muse. Great location, fabulous restaurant and bar, clean comfy fully-equipped room, what more can you ask for! Staff were very friendly, allowing us an early check-in and offering some tips on theatre tickets etc. Only slight problem - our room was on the 7th floor facing the street - little bit noisy, but hey its NYC. Our superior room had a huge king size bed, great mini-bar, huge bathroom with tub and shower and all the little extras you expect - steam iron, hairdryer, lots of towels etc. Can't recommend the hotel enough.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

harming! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed. We had room #11, which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn, but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast. We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by. The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful. Don't miss the Pancake Bakery around the corner!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming, so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there. The lobby is absolutely exquisite, and the staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms didn't quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side. However, the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a pricier hotel for a weekend stay in Boston, close to many opportunities for great shopping,entertainment, and activities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days (before going back to work  reality). We were in the first group to leave the ship, so we arrived at the hotel at 9:30am! The staff couldn't have been friendlier. They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits, and we sunned at the beach  had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2:30pm. We especially enjoyed the following: our very large and comfortable tower room, uncrowded beach, health club facilities, and good restaurants within walking distance. I recommend the hotel for a great pre- or post-cruise stay in San Juan.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views. When we got there, 3/4 of the view was of the blank brick wall of the adjoinging building but they still considered and charged as a water view. When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it. Disappointing service and attention - we would have strongly preferred accurate representations of what to expect even if it meant higher room rates.

Great Area in Boston We had to take our son to Boston Children's Hospital and this hotel is extremely close by. The amenities of this hotel are great and accomodating especially after a long day in the hospital. The bar area was great, the food court attached had everything for somebodies taste and the hotel was close to the train, Fenway Park and tons of other neat attractions. At one point during our visit, the hotel had to shut down the water( not their fault however an inconvenience) and our A/C did not work the greatest.

Handlery great but!!! Myself and 4 Girlfriends stayed in The Handlery Hotel for 4 nights, we had booked a twin and triple room on arrival we were upgraded to the club section with interconnecting doors Fantastic location a lovely hotel, I would recommend to anyone except for one thing the staff are not very friendly in particular the bar staff. We found them very rude no way helpful and if they could avoid serving us they would. I would still stay there again as the location and hotel were first class. Probably avoid having a drink!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]

Great location for an Amsterdam stopover The other reviews are right, the hotel is close to everything - trains, RLD, restaurants, shopping, etc. Reasonably clean - not spotless.

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month. Tastefully decorated, spacious and clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room!The location is ideal as it is close to everything you could possibly want to do in the Big Apple and there really is no need to take cabs as the subway is minutes away.

Lovely, peaceful hotel 2nd visit to Paris. First time we stayed at The Novotel which was too large  very businesslike. We really enjoyed the position of Hotel Bassano in a typical, quiet part of Paris - a much more romantic setting. The staff are very polite  willing to please. We found the room delightful  very comfortable (it was much appreciated when we went out for the evening to find our bed had been turned back  chocolates left for us - a very nice touch).

Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site, and the hotel lived up to expectations! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help. We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children, but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around, so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again, having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington. The hotel is conveniently located (about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro), the staff is friendly and accomodating, and the suites are comfortable and well laid out. The 32'' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus. Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items (eggs, omelets, etc) and an evening cocktail reception, both of which are fantastic. The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro (about a 5-10 minute ride).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive']]
Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel. The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying.

Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels, so Laguna had to meet the expectations, and mostly it did. My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool.

The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location.

Personally.. . They have an excellent personal service, I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included, because I had to pay 12 euros per head. Apart from that, I loved the room.

Melia bali - Honeymoon Just returned fro a 2 week stay at the melia and we have not a bad word to say about this fantastic hotel or this beauiful island. Nusa dua is located to the south of the island around half an hour from the airport, Nusa dua is also very safe and secure with every vehicle being checked over by security guards as you enter through the gates and again when you enter the hotel grounds, But please do not be worried about walking round in bali as it is all very safe and friendly, There are some fantastic authentic resturants just outside the nusa dua gates or for a good resturant inside the gates there is a shopping center called bali collection which has a free shuttle bus from all the hotels ( just ask at reception)The Hotel is set in a fantastic location right on the beach the rooms are very nice and spacious with a very traditional modern balinese feel which is carried on through the hotel there are also many resturants in the hotel grounds, Styles include japanese medeterainian, tapas and world cusine.

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews. Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar, were helpful, friendly and entertaining. Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated. The view alone is worth the visit! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I've visited. Oh and the spa...if you can fit it in do so, the perfect end to a great island vacation.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Absolutely brilliant... Myself and my girlfriend stayed 3 nights at this hotel just recently. I can highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the brilliant city of Barcelona.

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights. Despite the other reviews which might scare you off, we found the staff friendly and very responsive, room was clean and in good shape, and only a few very minor issues. Whenever we called, someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less (e.g. extra blankets and pillows). This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt. Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore. About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior---though there were plenty of grab bars.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Good service, great location, fantastic pool I was supposed to stay just for one night, but I end up staying for two and luckily because I've just met the amazing pool on the second day. It's a fantastic pool, on the 16th floor, and that has an all year round temperature of 27 degrees. The location is also great and the prices not as high as many of its competitors. Besides the rooms are spacious and full of small details that make our stay very pleasant. I hope to be back soon!####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great Resort, Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites, pools and golf, but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation. The suites at PHTC are roomy, clean, quiet and offer great views. We stayed 3 days at this resort and would definitely stay again, but would avoid the restaurants. The staff at the Resort are super helpful (and this includes the restaurant staff), but the 3 different resataurants we ate at (on property) were mediocre at best. Food was tasteless and very ordinary.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Loved It We stayed here for 2 Nights in 2004 and loved the hotel. The location is great as its on the busy Orchard Rd shopping area with easy access to the MRT and transport links.

Stayed here for the Sydney Marathon and loved it! This hotel was really nice!!!From the check in where the receptionist was lovely - they didn't have our room ready so placed us on the 32nd floor - - -amazing room. You can even hear the TV with a seperate speaker in the toilet!!! (Small things I know)Great views, perfect service - made a really good coffee for us and they had amazing service aswell...

Great Hotel, superb location Just returned from H10 Montcada, this is an excellent hotel in a great location in Barri Gothic one street away from La Ramblas. Yes the rooms are quite small but we had no problems and it does have a great bathroom. Only minor problem was with the room safe not opening one evening, this was rectified within 5 mnutes of informing reception. Got the aerobus from airport for 3.90 euro single, stops right outside the arrivals at airport, hotel is a 10 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya use via Laetana to walk down, its less crowded to walk with a trolley case. Used the Bus turistic two-day pass for sightseeing, this is an excellent way to see all the best bits of Barcelona. Highly recommended hotel, and a great city to visit.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Fabulous location The Hotel had been recommended by my sister and for a girl travelling on her own , it was fantastic. Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter's restaurant district , it was perfect to eat out and walk safely to hotel , even at night .Needed to close window at night tho' cos can be noisy if you are an early to bed person. Breakfast was fabulous and lovely helpful staff. I felt very secure and like I was in a home away from home .Highly recommend it , especially if a female travelling alone , very secure yet allowed freedom to eat out at night in many places around it .R.R.Australia####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
I just loved this hotel!!!!!! We stayed at this hotel while on vacation in L.A. last summer. I was extremely pleased with everything about this hotel, there is not one thing that I could complain about.

Budget hotel with a very good location Located in the heart of Chinatown, this is a great budget hotel for those who want to have just a place to sleep. The rooms are pretty small, but the bathroon was pretty big comparing to the room. It was mostly clean, except the bedclothes/towels, which could be better. We had a double room with a street view, and it was much lighter, than our friends room, which has only one window with a courtyard view, but it was much more noisy... The front desk is a bit smelly and old, but the staff was nice.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great for special break We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved It Myself, my son and daughter and two of their friends stayed at the St. James and we loved it. They would have liked a larger pool, but we really didnt have that much time for swimming anyway. The rooms were large, clean and had a wonderful atmosphere. We go to New Orleans several times a year and usually stay at another hotel, but this one is perfect and with in walking distance of all our favorite attractions. This is our new hotel of choice.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Location the best in San Fransisco....... We stayed at the holiday inn from 6-13 nov 2004,the hotel is an average 3 star but the views from the hotel are second to none. If possible ask for a bay view room on a high floor,the views of the bay are breathtaking. The best thing about this hotel is the location,across the road from Portsmouth Square,the heart of Chinatown,a 5 minute walk to North Beach the Italian district and 15 minutes either direction walking to the shopping district of Civic Square and the tourist thoroughfare of Fisherman,s Wharf,definately 10 out of 10 for location. For breakfast i would reccomend the Garden Restaurant outside the hotel,on the left,as breakfast in the hotel is overpriced and poor,similaly if you need a camera film etc the hotel shop is way overpiced so walk across to Chinatown and get your goods in the shops there. We would stay here again but that is down to the location,the best in San Fransisco,rather than the hotel itself...........####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Nice but noisy Very mixed feelings about this hotel. Don't need to dwell on the positives (look  feel, location, very friendly service) as they're all pretty much covered in the previous reviews.. The big downside is noise. Both from outside the room (the noise from the pool can continue late into the evening), and from the thunderous air conditioning unit which you have no choice but to use, given the heat and humidity of the N.O. summer. Notwithstanding this, I would probably stay here again. But if you're a light sleeper and you're travelling in the summer months, I would recommend you look elsewhere.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'neutral']]
Lovely hotel I was lucky enough to get one of their 拢1 rooms but would have been just as happy paying the standard rate. Lovely modern hotel with friendly helpful staff. Rooms were lovely with everything you needed. The pillows and duvets were divine. The bathroom was lovely with a large walk in shower. Would definately recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
l, Relaxing Modern Retreat This was our 2nd stay in as many years at Bravo Beach Hotel and once again it was a wonderful time. Thomas, the manager, and the rest of the staff are fantastic, the property is fabulous, and the two restaurants are excellent! I love the sleek design of the rooms (very caribbean modern), the intimate size of the hotel (only 9 rooms), that almost every room has a view of the ocean, the ipod docks in the rooms, the 2 pools (one with a bar where you mix your own drinks!) and the groovy music that plays on the property all day long. It's just a very cool, relaxing setting with no pretense. We love it and look forward to returning next year to BBH!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Fantastic value We were very pleased with this hotel - granted the rooms are not that smart and the decoration is a bit old but everything was very clean and comfortable the lobby, pool and staff are all lovely and the breakfast buffet was just amazing (although quite expensive!) The free pool towels were very welcome and the housekeeping staff responded immediately when we had a problem with an overflowing cistern! It is a good 20 minute walk from all the action but during the day walking along the beachfront to the art deco area is lovely. If you are averse to noise though make sure you ask for a room high up as the bar in the lobby is very noisy!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]

Fine, nothing more We arrived really tired from a very delayed flight, and the room was fine. For the price, I would prefer washable duvet covers instead of the yucky bedspreads. Anyways, we liked the free wireless internet, and the hotel suited us just fine-- we slept well and had no troubles. They were happy to hold our reservation until 3am because of the delayed flight, and to keep a non-smoking king for us, which we appreciated.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
>If you are traveling on a budget, this is great ... If you are doing San Juan on a shoestring, the Mango Inn will not disappoint. Sure, the view from your room may be obstructed by a billboard and the faucet might drip all night, but for $75 you can't beat it. If you are reasonably low maintenance this is definitely worth it. - Submitted by a girly girl.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Perfect place to stay This hotel was absolutely fabulous. The room was spotless, the king size bed was comfortable and the location was magnificent! It was in a very safe neighborhood and within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping, plus the bus stopped right down the street. Gary was a great help in securing our shuttle to the airport and helping us with places to eat. The hotel was very quiet as it was at the end of Lombard street.

couldn't be Better! We couldn't fault this wonderful condo. After reading lots of reviews of lots of places, I'd have to say that everything was excellent (except for the American fondness for dim lighting!) (I had to remove the lamp shades so we could read). No elevator queues, friendly competent staff in all areas, gorgeous condo, great location and views, masonry construction (so no noise transference between condos) - no street noise with doors closed. We had been staying on the north shore in a house I'd booked over the internet, and it was ok at best, so finding accommodation in Waikiki Beach Tower at the last minute was fantastic.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
i liked the place To my surprise this was actually a very well run and a very nice resort. I arrived expecting the worst and they were actuallly better than what is being told on the page first the employees were very helpful and courteous the room was very nice , you are in the tropics so you keep the air conditioning on to circulate the air, We enjoyed the food and entertainment.

Excellent value for money We stayed in this hotel from 29th Dec to 1st January. The hotel is small and the staff are very friendly. The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable. As other people have stated, the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city. It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station. Considering what some of the other hotels were charging in Paris, I would consider this hotel to be excellent value for money.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
A great hotel! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, and it is within walking distance of most attractions (we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes). I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity, however, this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia.com that it is four star hotel. The rooms were great, the breakfasts were very nice, and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella. We stayed in Florence for a week and had a wonderful time.

Fantastic Our company used the Michelangelo Hotel for a business meeting with 16 participants. The hotel was fantastic, from the absolutely wonderful rooms to the service, and the great European feel. The staff was helpful, friendly and the meeting staff was available non-stop. They do not have a business office per se, however, they were willing to make copies for us in their offices, and Kinko's is a couple of blocks away. Definitely a great experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Lovely hotel I stayed at the Adolphus for 3 days in April 2007. I was impressed with the hotel overall. Many hotels claim to be 'historic' but really thats just a cover up for being a bit old and lacking in services, not so with the Adolphus!The Adolphus was great, room was big, and good value for money considering its location and the standard of the furnishings.

Best hotel in Amsterdam This hotel is a personal favourite of mine. An Amsterdam townhouse on a quiet side canal, yet within walking distance of just about anything you want to see (and convenient for Anne Frank's house in particular).

ice hotel We had a beautiful room, very big, with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom, But this is an old hotel, dated. I found it not very clean, the carpets were dirty and also the restaurant was like that (and food was not so good...). I didn't like all that cement, gray walls. Anyway, people working there were nice, we arrived late at night but they allowed us to have dinner even if the restaurant was already closed, and they gave us a lot of information: very nice and polite. I think it is a good hotel if you have children (the pool is very big), but it is too much expensive for the quality of the building.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

We looked on Trip Advisor prior to going and the Savoy was highly recommended, we were not disappointed. Situated in the Plazza Della Republica with great views this is a beautiful hotel with great rooms great restaurants and some of the best trained staff we have ever come across, the service was second to none and the manager should be proud of him/herself. The location is great with all the attractions of Florence within easy walking distance. Our rooms were at the front directly overlooking the Plzza Della Republica, it was amazing , we could look out and listen to music playing every night, from violins, to salsa, opera and the atmosphere was electric - Cant wait to go back !!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

better for pleasure than business As lovely as other kimptons in terms of quality of finish  amenities. Very servicable fitness area, in-room desks with wired net, cute nautical touches. Right smack in the heart of the tourist waterfront. I would come back with my spouse for vacation or if you're a business person dragging family then this would be a great fit. Some of the rooms are quite spacious and would be good for families. As a straight business traveler it was a distracting location, with a low noise level that I'd roll with if I were vacationing too but was hard to not feel curmudgeonly when I had 7:30 am meetings.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative']]

The hotel was very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.

gotta love the gym Other reviews have covered the room, the food etc. I want to add that the hilton has the best health club I have come across on my business trips. The latest in exercise machines, good selection of free weights and best of all, access to group fitness classes. This alone makes this hotel worth a return visit.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Very Nice Hotel Recently my wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights. The hotel was very nice with exzcellent service . The hotel staff could not do enough for you.

>Caveat on 'Ocean View' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower. There was a nice view of the harbor, but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific. I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind, but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified, and refused to move us. Other then this disappointment, the hotel was great.####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel. It is very comfortable, modern hotel. It's location, a few minutes walk from the Sants train station, is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city. The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to. The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

Loved It... We got an excellent rate online which included breakfast (a must!) We could not have been more pleased with the hotel and staff. The rooms and hallways are a bit dated, but they are spotless and have many amenities.

lovely, just what you need if you are looking to stay somewhere pleasant but not too posh then this place is in a great location and not badly priced. we asked for a room with a view over the canal and it had great large windows for us to look out of.brekkie was nice and the bar at the front of the hotel was a nice atmosphere. For most people going to amsterdam, this place would be entirely suitable and in a great location. (quiet, just off rembrantsplain) if your looking for a plush pad, then go somewhere else.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Quite happy Very near to the cable car stop, which was really handy, and a great touristy thing to do. The room itself was pretty average - a bit dated, but was adequate for our needs. Our room had a great view of the Golden Gate bridge which was good. Would probably go back.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Loved the hotel This was a family trip for our daughter's senior year of high school and had always wanted to visit New York. Couldn't have asked for a better hotel than the Sofitel. Room, comfort, service, and anything we may asked for was great. The doormen are always pleasant and greet you going and coming (great source for info).

loved the Marroitt my stay at the marriott was july 1-4, 04 I really liked the location and the staff was great considering that I was there during the Essence music festival and it was full to capacity. my only disappointment was that the room was half cleaned and we had to wait for clean towels. other that that i will be back next year the same time same place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]

Perfect location for cruise ship passengers! We stayed two nights prior to leaving on a cruise. Location was great, really enjoyed the riverwalk and Harrahs across the street. Lots of conventions held there, check in took over an hour! Rooms were nice enough, what I expected from Hilton. We walked to the French Qtr and walked to the Peir with our rolling luggage!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Good, with a couple of minuses Many plus points distinguish this hotel - nice setting, friendly and cooperative staff, comfortable rooms. It is also pretty quiet, considering how close it is to the centre of town. The only food I tried here was breakfast and that too was good, but rather expensive.

Worst Hotel Stay... Ever!! We stayed here for the weekend to celebrate a bachelorette party. When we got to our room the door was wide open, our room key didn't work so we had to reactivate it every time we wanted to get back in, the floors were dirty, we didn't have enough beds to accodomate the girls, our window was broken with 90 degree hot air seeping in, no curtains to shade the room, and our bathroom light was broken! The hotel staff was rude and don't believe the pictures they show on their website, it looks nothing like that. Not worth the money at all, luckily after all our complaining we got our second night free!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Impossible to fault! This is just simply one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in - and there have been many!

Paper Thin Walls You know it's bad when you sneeze and the people in the next room bless you (actually happened). We could hear the lightest of sounds from both of our neighbors, and they weren't loud people.

A fabulous jewel A fabulous boutique hotel in a neighborhood with spectacular views of the city.... we came for my 50th birthday and were upgraded to a city suite that was more memorable and charming than that of my honeymoon.

A hidden gem in the center of Manhattan We love small European hotels and rarely see anything similar in the United States. We could have sworn we were in Paris but we were in the middle of New York.

Shabby is definitely the word Checked into the Sheraton and asked specifically for a room NOT overlooking the construction. Got a room overlooking just that. Ripped curtains, dirty carpet (from construction dust). This property is not run by Sheraton, just under their umbrella. For the price charged, I would NOT recommend staying there. Perhaps Sheraton should review some of the hotels they license to outside owners.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Disappointing Given the reviews I read about the Oberoi and the reputation of the chain, I expected excellent and consistent service. We were surprised at the lack of consistency of the service and had a bad experience with the staff's confusion regarding whether breakfast was included in our rate. The management is clearly not doing its job in ensuring consistency and communication amongst the staff. The grounds, however, are beautiful and the location is lovely, however I think there are better value for money options in Bali.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'neutral']]
ral location with friendly atmosphere. We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location, were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city, just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars, to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas. Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you. Our room was on the ninth floor and the view from the window overlooking the roof tops was lovely, the bathroom was very modern, and it was handy to have a safe deposit box in you room at no extra charge. We found the hotel recepitionists all to be very helpful.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Not what I expected unfortunately. After booking in for business travel I was given a small rooom with barely enough space to walk around the queen size bed. Not very luxurious with regular TV etc (no flat sceen), and no view from the 6th floor. I requested a better room and was given a room on the top floor right next to the elevators, which were noisy and disturbed my sleep. After requesting a room change again I was given another average room by front desk staff who seem reluctant to help. As far as deluxe hotels go this place is really quite average - I think there are many better 5* hotels out there.####[['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great value Hard to imagine better value for the money. The room was clean, the location great, the staff courteous (although sometimes a bit flustered). If you want great value, stay here. If you want a hotel where the staff grovel at your feet and lick your boots, then stay somewhere else and pay much more. A note for critics of the staff ...a few thoughtful words in French will pay substantial dividends in terms of service.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Recommended Hotel In Hong Kong Nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong (I typically prefer Hong Kong Island side as its closer to my favorite shopping areas and cool neighborhoods like SoHo). I'm definitely a fan of the Shangri-La chain of hotels. The service is always fantastic and you get a feel for the Asian culture. The rooms are very nice, spacious, and well decorated. The lodging was very reasonable when I stayed there - around $200USD/night - more than worth it!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

Overall good For the price and location you can't do better. The staff is very friendly, you are 30 seconds away from the beach on foot, and 30 seconds away from buses to the airport or old San Juan. Isla Verde (where the hotel is) is a safe touristy place but, of course, old San Juan is far more picturesque -- and far more expensive... Make sure to eat at PLATOS, the hotel's restaurant: some of the best food I had in Puerto Rico and, again, very reasonably priced.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great Location From the time I arrived at the front door until I left, the staff made you fell welcome. The breakfast is very good, but having dinner at the hotel is a little expensive.

Some Trick photography in the advertising The main saving graces of this hotel are the helpful and friendly staff and the fact the windows open to let the smell out!! I burst out laughing when I saw the gym, it is a converted closet and is so small the treadmill has to be put on an angle to fit. I've had two broken TV sets in a row (Maybe a rock band stayed there before me).####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Wonderful exterior but damp  The Fullerton is in a fantastic location - especially if you are doing business in Singapore. And it looks great from the outside. But the rooms can be very damp and musty - and I've stayed in this hotel on about 8 separate occasions now.... Plus worst of all is that sometimes in the middle of the night I've been woken up by extremely loud airconditioning noises. Not acceptable in a 5 star hotelIf in Singapore and looking for a decent hotel I'd recommend 4 Seasons or Raffles The Plaza as better hotels for similar or lower price.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
>A perfect beginning A fantastic location providing excellent value for money. For 拢50 a night in central san francisco this hotel is certainly a find. The continental breakfast is a good start to the day including waffles, breakfast croisants, cereal, toast and huge muffins. The hotel is two minutes from union square and close to both Powell Mason  Hyde and California cable car lines. My only criticism is that the rooms are a little small and you can find yourself falling over your bags.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great hotel! I really enjoyed my stay at the Barcelo Hotel Sants. I spent a week there and if you're looking for moderatly priced accommodation in an excellent location, i would thoroughly recommend you stay here. Location, service, rooms were all excellent.

Great location! Great location base from which to explore Amsterdam. Basic amenities, but that was all we needed for a City break. Rooms were clean and serviced, breakfast was provided and there was plenty to fill up on.

Quality hotel at reasonable prices - recommended I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend in February with friends who were celebrating a wedding. Found the hootel to be spotlessly clean, convenient for the underground and most of the sites, the staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. I only ate there at breakfast, but this was excellent with lots of choice and good serving times. The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The receptionists also helped to locate traditional German food and everyone enjoyed the hospitality of our hosts. It was my first visit to Berlin, but I will definitely be going again and will stay at the Movenpick.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Very bad place We stayed at the hotel in two days from the 12of dec. to the 14of dec. 2008. The hotel are run down, the room are smelly and dirty, and the staff are not very helpfully at all. Eating breakfast at the hotel is expencive and you are still hungry after, because of the very small portions. We where gratefull that we only had to spent two days there, before going to Miami port for a seven days cruise with the beautifull ship Freedom of the Seas.

Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay. The location is amazing, literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla, a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don't walk around on your own it's fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night, just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys. The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing. We had a well equipped bathroom, a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed. The staff are very helpful too.

Problems with Website I have not stayed at the hotel, but did make an online reservation through the hotel's official website. This has proven impossible to cancel online. The hotels cancellation web-page is non-responsive and my hotel-issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box. I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer's comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e-mailed his cancellation. Obviously this hotel has problems.####[['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great value, huge rooms This property isn't the nicest or the best location, but the rooms are huge and clean. I stay here for business a lot and can really spread out, like having an apartment while I'm away from home. The staff isn't the best, but friendly and accomodating. If you are going to the convention center, this is one block away. If you're leisure traveling, there are other great places to stay in the same rate level with more character, but for extended trips it can't be beat for the price and comfort.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Nice little hotel in the middle of the big apple It a small hotel on the Manhattan side of the brooklyn bridge that is good for a business or pleasure traveler. Standard Hampton morning breakfast, helpful staff, but very small rooms, so if you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it might be cramped.

a true oasis I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay, saying i thought the value vs. price was not worth it, that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be, but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments. i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn't have stayed at a finer hotel. the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous, beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff, to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks, to the invitation to join them for canap茅s and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles, robes and slippers laid out. it's a true oasis from the rush of central London. you won't regret it!####[['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
The Silla is fabulous and so reasonable Brilliant, quiet, family run, view over Arno, 5 mins walk from ponte vecchio - ask for room 23 or equivalent - aircond is whisper quiet but enough to mask traffic and partner's snoring. Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well. Lovely terrace for breakfast or drinks - minibar in room will take your duty free, but no tea making equipment (only minus point).

Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn't disappointed. This area of Amsterdam is great as it's out of the main hustle and bustle, near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright, clean, modern bathroom. The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park, great for strolling around and watching the locals run, jog and walk their dogs (sometimes at the same time!).I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Spot On Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D'Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss. Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb.

Nice place for limited budget My experience with this place was very positive. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The location is excellent, close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation (5-10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop (24) right in front of the hotel).

The location was very good, in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy, and the tram links were frequent and convenient. After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I've seen in Europe. The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch, and the Living Room reception area, with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks, was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons.. All in all, a great place and would not hesitate in recommending to any####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Magnificent Oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Mongkok. Superb hotel with all the expected facilities at a good value price. Our 25th floor Executive Room was spacious, clean  comfortable. Excellent service throughout. We have never had as stress free an arrival in a new city as we did in Hong Kong, having booked the transfer from the airport to the hotel. Good location close to subway, making easy connections to all parts of the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Location Great location, would recommend this hotel for a city break! Just off the Placa Catalunya, but no problems with street noise, the room was fine. A little small, but we didnt spend much time there anyway. We didnt eat in the restaurant and breakfast wasnt included so cant comment! Would go back.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Great Position and Value for Money We stayed at the Plaza Mayor in November 2006 during our Around the World trip. The staff were absolutely fabulous and so helpful. They recommended places to eat, especially La Bola,and advised us how to get around Madrid. The room we stayed in was fabulous and had everything we needed. We would certainly return to this Gem of a Hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Four star location, one star service The palomar is an elegant hotel with a good central downtown location. The restaurant is rated highly by a number of gourment magazines and rooms are pleasant if on the small side. However the front desk staff have no interest in helping customers outside of routine check in and check out. Service is more akin to a 1 star hotel. I would rate the hotel 4 stars for location and 1 star for servic####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Great stay at the Palomar Stayed here for five nights, excellent food and service. A meal in the resaurant is a must and the breakfasts are good, but expensive. Lovely quiet room at the back, no view to speak of but didn't need it as the hotels central location means that more time is spent outside the room than inside! Could not fault this hotel, a perfect place to start a holiday in California.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great Location! For those who've never been to San Francisco, The Tuscan Inn (near Fisherman's Wharf) is the perfect first. We were near all the transportation modes (and there are plenty), shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Our room was large and comfortable, and the staff was top-notch (especially Elmer). If you have a question, they have the answer or will get it for you. We were very pleased with The Tuscan Inn.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
return visit to New Orleans O.K. for the budget vacationer on foot. $47.99 a night, Dec. 18-20. Breakfast is sweet rolls  coffee. No juice, tea, or hot chocolate.

Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler. The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk. After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs, we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk. The Manager (some guy) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new. So what if old or new staff, this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake! I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great location, fun district and nearby a major subway/train station We usually stay at the Peninsula when in Tokyo for business, but a Japanese colleague recommened the Cerulean. The location was great, walking distance to the side-streets of Shibuya and the Shibuya train station which has connections to many of the major tourist sights. The hotel itself was adequate and clean. Service was good, but still not compable to five star hotels like the Peninsula or Four Seasons. A friend mentioned the Italian restaurant there was good, but we didn't have the chance to try it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Unfair Due to loss of my credit card on holiday, I could not show the card used for payment of the room. The staff were very unhelpful, and proceeded to charge for the room but refused to let us stay despite proof of ID. Waste of 拢73. We had to make our way to the airpost and stay there for the evening as it was too late to go anywhere else.####[['service general', 'negative']]
Not recommended The room was disappointing. The furniture was very scuffed, and the walls had some stains. The staff was somewhat friendly, but more better looking than actually helpful. The exception was the valets, who were consistently doing a great job. For the money, better accomodation can be found in Seattle.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

recommended by a friend We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008. A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before. Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia. We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there. The beach was within easy walking distance.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Above average, good value Spent 2 nights at the Eastgate Tower, in mid-town Manhattan. It is well located, close enough to Grand Central Station to catch the trains, a healthy but do-able walk to Broadway Theatres, and there's a decent bagel place (Daniel's) a couple of blocks away. The room (2 beds) was large, with a kitchenette, which is very convenient for storing and heating up food (there's an oven/range+ microwave, sink and fridge, with dishes and utensils provided). Maid service included dish-washing. TV was an older CRT model.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Efficient, patient, friendly I stayed at the Savoy for a shopping weekend in Berlin and found it a superb elegant hotel. The lobby and the restaurant simply invite to sit down and relax.

Just like they said... The Jazz was just as I had expected it to be.

Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ($110 per night) at the Ilima in Dec 2005. Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques (Gucci, Chanel, Prada, etc.) and restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment, but that is OK, since you are not paying prime $$$. The rooms are outdated, but clean, comfortable, and roomy. We found the staff to be friendly. If you are looking to save money and be within walking distance to all the action on Waikiki, then stay at the Ilima.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Great Place to Destress..... Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven. We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball. The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog!The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic. We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy. All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre (5/8 minutes away)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Perfect location This is a great little hotel in the most romantic spot right on the canal. Yes, difficult to find on first arriving, but that's the only thing I'd say to watch out for. The location was perfect, right in the centre of things but not so close that noise is a problem. The room was lovely and so were the staff.

Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews. Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath. Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place, a massive shopping centre but not cheap!The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location. The hotel is next to the Shangri-la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri-la blocks the sun from the pool. Other than that the place is faultless.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Will not stay here again! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham, WA to San Diego, CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn  Suites. Yes, the hotel was within walking distance of the Space Needle. However, when I requested a 2pm check-out (we did not check-in until after 7pm) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members, I was told the latest we could check-out was 1pm; the room was small; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed; only one elevator worked and it was slow; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person; after showering, the bathtub took forever to drain (over 8 minutes) and left behind scum; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room; the business center computer was out of order; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Great place to stay Stopped for three days on the way to NZ, and enjoyed immensely. Room pretty good although can get a bit noisy outside, saying that my 5 year old slept perfectly. The reason for 5 is partly for location but mainly for the excellent staff, for example we arrived and I had lost the suitcase keys. the desk guy managed to find a saw and had freed up our possesions before I returned with (superb) coffees from opposite 7-11. Nothing seems to be too much trouble.

Superb hotel, great staff, fab location Just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona with my mum. Booked this hotel after reading good reviews on this website and it did not disappoint. The location is fantastic, lots of great sights within walking distance and no matter where we wanted to go, it cost us less than 5 euro's in a taxi. The staff were very friendly and took time to point us in the right direction for the sights we wanted to visit and also recommended and booked restaurants for us free of charge. Our room was very comfortable, they remembered to not give me feather pillows and the free minibar was a lovely touch.

Great anniversary night! We were able to check in early (probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend) and the desk clerk, when entering our Hilton rewards card number, found out it was our 32nd anniversary. She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room, facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room. The staff were all very nice, from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there, to the desk clerk, to the health club attendant, to the shuttle bus drivers.

Last year, stayed the Sheraton Four Points for 110 USD, was a better deal than Embassy Suites DC on 22nd.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Obsessed with this hotel! We got a great deal on Orbitz for this amazing hotel. The location is outstanding, smack between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria. We had a room facing the back, from which we could open our windows to overlook the picturesque Florentine rooftops and an overwhelming view of the Duomo itself! Our room was huge; comfortable and modern furniture, a very clean and beautiful bathroom (maybe a tad on the small side) but a separate sitting room with a sofa/twin bed and separate TV with its own amazing view. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
classy hotel Classy hotel, in a classy part of barcelona, near to all the sights, a bit of a walk to las ramblas so a bit further away from the party scene. very helpful staff, rooms very tastefully decorated with nice bathrooms. turn down service and a pillow menu! some of the rooms do differ considerably in size though, maybe ask for a larger room,,also the rooftop pool is only really aplunge pool but the rooftop is lovley to sit out and have a few relaxing drinks.breakfast very expensive!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Silly Style Over Substance I spent two nights at the W recently and had to supress myself from laughing on several occasions. The pool has the letters WET printed on the bottom - thanks, I would never have guessed... This place has pseudo-hip styling flourishes that serve no purpose and dance music is piped into every conceivable public area ( gym, elevators,lobby,restrooms, etc.). As you approach the main entrance, large motorized drapes automatically part and reveal - a staff of slacker twentysomethings ! Overall, those over age 26 may want to look elsewhere.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
xcellent hotel and city Just come back from Beijing, stayed 7 nights at the Crown Plaza, this is an excellent hotel, good location, spotless rooms, great service especially in the champagne bar! booked on the hotel website and payed 拢400 for the room for a week, an excellent price for this level of hotel. a few tips, make sure you get a metre taxi from the airport, and that the metre is used (we had no problems with this) cost to wangfujing street should be 90/110 yuan about 拢7.00, and takes about 40 mins. taxi to the great wall 600 yuan, that includes waiting for as long as you like we were their about 3 hrs, recommend the wall at Mutianyu, takes about 1.5 hours to get to. Great resturant is buffalo at Houhai lake, you will have a great time in this fab city!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
I'd stay there again I spent a week at Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel in May of 2003. The service was great, the rooms were clean and decorative, I enjoyed the breakfasts set out by the pool, and the location was great. We were right across the street from Waikiki beach and within walking distance of several shops. I would definitely stay there again in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Just OK Conveniently located in Waikiki. Can be very noisy at night! A bit outdated too. Overall, nothing special for what you pay.

Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar, a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique, 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris. In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy. A good room, clean and tidy and attentive staff. A check in problem was expertly and politely solved. bar expensive and you are better off taking breakfast in a local bar than the hotel (15 euro buffet anyone?). Recommended for a long weekend, we'll stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
It's All True! We stayed here just one night during a week-long stay in the Chianti area, and the member raves are quite well deserved. The hotel is extremely well situated; the owners/staff could not have been nicer or more patient and accommodating; the rooms were immaculate, and ours was of quite decent size. We didn't take the breakfast, but heard from our friends that it was lovely. We would absolutely recommend Hotel Casci to all of our family and friends traveling to Florence, and we hope to come back soon ourselves.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought, for price and location, you can't beat it. They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for -- minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored. So basically, aside from lack of towels at the pool, out stay was comfortable and hassle free and exactly what we were looking for.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Jury's Boston Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms, but for 拢150.00 per night they should be! Only complaint was the food. Bar food expensive and not very good. For breakfast recommend Au Bon Pain. 2 minutes walk from the the hotel and excellent and extensive and cheap menu Small friendly hotel The staff in this hotel were very friendly and helpful. The bedroom was big enough for the few days we were there. We had breakfast 3 mornings which was good value for money. Thought overall the hotel was excellent value for money in a good location and would return to this hotel if I visited Barcelona again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'conflict'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Good Hotel Above standard 5 * hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful and eventhough they were very very busy they managed to check us in early!!

Bad I stayed in this hotel in early March, although the location is excellent, we will not return to this hotel. We checked in at 2:30pm and the room was not ready. The room is nice but it is dusty.

Wherever you stay in New York make sure you bring some comfortable shoes for walking. My feet were killing me after a day pounding the pavements.

a warm and intimate hotel in a big city We recently spent a long weekend at The Benjamin. I have to agree with all the previous positive posts.

ice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4-11th,2008, found hotel to be showing its age ,Doormen and staff very polite and courteous. But as a show Hotel for Boston ,I think it could do with some updating. As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings ,such as Trinity church and the Library,but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city. What I can say is we experienced some history that the hotel showed in its makeup.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]
Great location The hotel is very central and clean. However, on checking in, they told us our room was in another building across the road, which turned out to be another hotel but owned by Hotel Victoria 4. The rooms were tiny, noisey, with no natural light and a view of the hotel room opposite. Would recommend this Hotel for its location but I would insist on a room in the main building of Hotel Victoria 4.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Look no further for your Sydney stay If you're looking for a comfortable, central hotel then look no further. Our room was well proportioned and clean, staff went out of their way to help us and our three year old daughter. Slap bang in the middle of everything tourist wise, it's about a ten minute stroll from Circular Quay and five minutes from Darling Harbour.

New York's finest hotel This is the best hotel in New York - over the years i have stayed in many for business and pleasure, but if you are spending your own money and want value and a lovely place to stay, this is the place. We had a park view room and waking up was a pleasure. indeed the curtains were never shut. What sets this hotel apart is the location and the extra amenities - the bar is one of the best in NY and the concierge can't help enough and it's all done unintrusively.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Fantastic place for the price For the second time in the span of about four weeks I'll be visiting London on business. And for the second time I booked my hotel stay at the Parkcity. As others have mentioned, the hotel is situated at a clean and relatively quiet location in Kensington. It's within a short walking distance from Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum. The staff are friendly and a pleasure to chat. I was suitably impressed with my previous stay at the Parkcity and will be so again in early July.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Fantastic hotel, staff very helpfull and polite rooms spotless and central location superb, within walking distance of all attractions just a short walk down to the marina, the tour bus stops just up the street (鈧?20 / person all day unlimited travel). Travelled from the airport on the service bus ~ 鈧? per couple returned by Taxi ~ 鈧?25-30. Glass of carva on arrival and the breakfast was very good (if a little expensive).

The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street. But found this small hotel, only 1/2 block off of Bourbon, to be a quiet jewel.

Brilliant hotel I spent two nights at Calzaiuoli at the end of last month and can't fault it. It's location is superb and although I was worried it would be noisy because it's so central, we weren't disturbed all night. The breakfast is exactly what you expect and perfectly good with lots of hot, strong coffee. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Florence and this one is definitely up there with my favourite, the Antica Torre, but this one is definitely more affordable. The perfect base from which to explore Florence.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Not too bad Having stayed here a number of times in the past the hotel is beginning to show wear a bit. Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout which is always as I have found it. The room facilities are as you would expect and the rooms are quite spacious (from a European point of view).I like this hotel because of it's proximity to the Central Rail Station where I can get into and out of the Airport quickly without relying on a taxi (or other transport).Food is of a reasonably good standard for breakfast. The Restaurant is highly regarded for it's Dutch food. The hotel is close to the nightlife centres without being on top of them - Dam Sq being about 5-10 mins walk.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Excellent service at a cost Good location on a side road of Orchard Road, but not necessarily the best location as Orchard Road is like Oxford St in London, busy and full of tourists. The service was amazing, using your name when you check in, giving you a butler etc. Rooms are excellent, well appointed and a descent size, pure luxury. Concierge and all the staff very helpful, however I did find the cost of drinks a little on the steep side, as was breakfast. Pool a little disappointing, more of a large plunge pool.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Its also a stone's throw from the Wharf and not noisy. Price was good considering the location (I paid about $200 a night). The staff was always, always, ready to help me out.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Too expensive, but clean and big room The hotel is situated right next to Dam sqare, in a quiet area. Location is more than perfect, walking distance to the main attractions (red light d, shopping, dam, bejighoff, central station, flower market, rembrandt, picasso).Don't expect the nice treats of a 180eur/night hotel. however, the room was quite large (around 18sqm) with a large bathroom, very clean.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
OK, but The hotel is located ideally for tourism. If they offer you a room around by the pool, DO NOT TAKE IT!! These rooms are not refurbished, noisy surroundings (generartors etc). The staff are very false, behind their smile is a very miserable person. The rooms in the main building are to standard, not the biggest but goog enough.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral']]

Lovely Quiet Quality Hotel I have had the pleasure to stay at this hotel twice in the past few months and was very impressed with it. The staff are very friendly, the hotel is very clean and quiet and so close to all in the city. The location being next to Central Railway Station is an asset and make it very easy to get to all locations whilst on holidays. The renovations to this hotel have made it nice and fresh with quality fittings and a pleasure to spend time in.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

The Best Having stayed at 30 Hotels in the last 90 days it takes a lot to get me enthused about a hotel at the moment but the Mandarin Oriental certainly did. I had a Harbour View room for 3 nights and the standard of the room and more importantly the standard of the service were exceptional. The gym and spa area are stunning also.

Fantastic service I am a travel agent booking hotels all over the world, so we are very very fussy. This hotel offers customer service at its' best. Great location, great service, nothing is too much bother. The rooms are great, cheaper than some of the well known names and frankly far better. Stay here and give yourself a treat with staff who really do genuinely care.

>No Internet access in hotel rooms !! The hotel itself is of average quality but there is no Internet access of any type in hotel rooms! The staff could be somewhat more polite and helpful (at least in opinion of someone used to European standards). If you use the shower be aware that you may get burned as the valve system is obsolete and not well maintained. The hotel is located very close to the airport, but not so easy to find as there are no road signs indicating proper direction and the hotel name is not visible from main roads.####[['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great break Arrived on the Saturday afternoon, pleasant staff greeted us. We were shown to our room via going through the famous garage area. We stayed on the fifth floor, i can honestly say that our room was very clean had working aircon and a safety deposit box. I do not have one complaint to make about the hotel, considering it only cost me 拢112.00 for three nights stay with breakfast i think that i came out of it very well.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Perpetual Guest We first found this hotel four years ago. Although the rooms are small, the privacy, ambience and staff more than make up for the lack of space. The bar, restaurant and reading room are unique and welcomed in an ever busy non-personal transit world of the traveller.

Superb location and wonderful room We stayed in room 609 at Swissotel from 9th to 11th August to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The location is superb right by Dam square with many great bars and restuarants only a short walk. It only took about 15 mins to walk from central station. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and our room was excellent with all amenities and a huge ensuite.

wonderfully comfortable We stayed for three nights April 2004. The room was very spacious and comfortable in every way.

great location, design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location, on a wide, very smart shopping boulevard in the centre. Also about 30 seconds from the (underground) train station to the airport (25 mins).Apart from the usual complaints about working the lights/blinds, and flooding the bathroom with the shower, we really enjoyed the room and our stay. Booked through the hotel website which gave us a free breakfast. We were at the back, and didn't hear any noise apart from a little from the corridor.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Loved it! The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful property located close to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City. It's located a floor or two above a large shopping center (handy as there are banks, drugstores and quick/cheap places to eat). We stayed on the club level which meant check in was in our room (nice touch), we had a separate concierge (albeit not speaking english as well as those in the lobby) and a delicious free breakfast and afternoon drinks. We had the grand suite - a nice bedroom with separate living/work area.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January. Had to wait till 4pm for room(official check in time 3pm)The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered. Room was big by NY standards and best view over NY I've had in 6 stays in the city. Very central for all attractions and the staff helpful and efficient. Very surprised nobody has mentioned the Westway diner on 9th Avenue between 41st and 42nd street as a great place for breakfast-or for that matter any meal-they're open 24/7.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Diamond in the Ruff The chancelor is ideally located, seconds away from Union Square, and you can catch the trolley to take you to the trains/MUNI or just walk it, its just blocks away.

Benchmark in Hospitality My fiancee and I flew down to SF from Canada and were extremely impressed with the decorum and class of this hotel. From the elevator completely covered in pages from old books, the complimentary Aveda shampoo (my fiancee was particularly fond of this), timely valet service, and exemplary service, staying at Hotel Rex made our stay in SF a flawless experience.

Discreet Charms Of The Neri On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren't disappointed. It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Having travelled extensively, far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use. The Neri, in common with good hotels, simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed, excellent assistance from the helpful staff, and a wonderful location for sightseeing. The hotel deserves to succeed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Excellent Not much more to say. I'm pretty picky about hotels but this a great place in every way. I agree with the last reviewer about not wanting too many people to find out about this place.

We think this hotel gives value for money - and is above average in its class. It has a friendly, professional staff in every function important to guests: reception, breakfast and cleaning.

Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this. he free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes, making it easy to get on the S-Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations. his is definitly a good value for an airport hotel. It's not as convienient as a hotel that is actually in the airport, but the location off site makes it nice and quiet - the rooms are extremely well insulated.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

A good location in Tokyo, the Metro is really close (use the covered underground walkway most of the way that means you don't have to cross any roads to get there) and provides good access to both East and West of the city and Akasaka has a good mix of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

simply the best Stayed there 7 times now at the Wiechmann, and at several other hotels and BB's in the Dam, for value for money etc you can't beat the Wiechmann, great family run smallish hotel, staff etc are superb, the positioning is fantastic, 10 mins walk to the Dam square, along the Ronkin etc, just round the corner from the Anne Frank house. Continental breakfast is fantastic, again, all staff very helpful and know everything about the surrounding area. Infact i'm back there the weekend 21st nov 2003.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
n the whole....fab I have to say that most of the reviews are spot on. IT IS a lovely little hotel, great value, great location, nice staff, and I would without a doubt stay there again. hey are a couple of things that others have mentioned which are also true, thin walls (felt like someone else was in the room) and it was a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed, but that was it. I had friends staying in one of the suites and that was great, so if you want a bit more of a treat for an extra 30 euros book one of those.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

Fabulous room and views! You definitely get what you pay for here. We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment with harbour views. he room was absolutely fantastic, very spacious, beautiful bathroom and fully equipped with everything you need. he view was great as well, which was expected considering the brillant location right on the harbour. We stayed here for one night after staying at another hotel for a week and though twice the price, it was 3 times as good!####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

xactly on the button just a short one this time....went to Barcelona on June 8 and stayed in the Caledonian. All in all nice hotel, the rooms are great, spotless, well stocked, and mine anyway would have had excellent wheelchair access, the reception and staff are helpful and the breakfast was simple, but tasty and filling. he hotel is supposedly 3 star but could do with a 4 star rating.... it is that nice. All in all, with its added locality to ' Las Ramblas ' would pound for pound, be hard to beat.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great hotel A great hotel in a fantastic location right next to Checkpoint Charlie. I received a free room upgrade to a maisonette on the 5th floor with a balcony overlooking the street - very nice!Excellent, varied breakfast, extremely pleasant staff and good overall level of service. ne criticism - I was visiting Berlin with work and so needed internet access in my room. nfortunately the wireless signal was very weak and I kept loosing the connection. ther than that I have nothing but praise for this very comfortable hotel!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
oved the hotel, staff and location he airport bus (1 stop from the airport) dropped us close to the hotel (400m) from Placa d Espanya, situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations (the best way to get around).Upon arrival we had to get the paperwork out to check that there had not been a mistake on the price as it far exceeded our expectations. We used a three day metro ticket to travel around, it was so easy, and the hotel gave us advice and a map. We were very close to the Magic Fountains, the tourist bus stops and Crue Coberta shopping street. he only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an Asian restaurant with no English spoken and had a great buffet meal, better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate, 50m from the hotel. he room was great with a large bed, a decent bathroom and a cheap mini-bar.####[['location general', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
a gem in Madrid Stayed at this hotel in November with my son and husband. We chose the hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. It is a beautiful hotel , brilliantly situated for all the tourist places. ur room was large, with a good view and well decorated. he staff were very helpful and the breakfast was good.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic For our first trip to Venice, and a special anniversary and birthday holiday, I cannot imagine any place could have been better. he staff was incredible, booking perfect reservations for dinners and helping us with transportation.

>Watch out for the Extras I stayed at the Four Season Mexico City on a Wednesday in late Febuary. verall the service was excellent and the lobby and courtyard areas are attractive. My room had two huge flat screen TVs and a view of Reforma but beyond that the furniture was nothing special for a hotel of this caliber. Also, while I expect to pay more for room service, internet access, and hotel cars in a more expense hotel like the Four Seasons, the prices seemed a bit excessive: $50 for a room service dinner of one beer, one bowl of soup, and a sandwich and $25 for wireless internet access.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'conflict'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Great location  Location was excellent. his hotel is very grand at reception and ground level. However rooms in older part of hotel need updating. We stayed on the 10th floor but were accompanied by renovations taking place in a room on that floor from 7.30am on 2 mornings! ot acceptable and informed manager who was very apologetic etc. My warning with this hotel is don't make any calls from the phone in your room as you will be very upset when you view your bill on checking out.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
he room couldnt have been more comfortable We stayed here for a quick lay-over before we drove up to Orlando. We thuroughly enjoyed our time at the hotel. While we did not use many of the ammenities (pool, breakfast etc), we were very satisfied with the service we did recieve. he room service staff were excellent...very polite and friendly and prompt. his was the perfect relaxation 3-day getaway we needed...and still relatively close to the Dolphin Mall and South Beach....would definitely reccommend the hotel!####[['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
smelly rooms, no hot choc but cool view! good value but a bit crap if you consider the smelly smokey rooms and the suspicious showers. he view from the room window is lovely though, over the Amstel, very romantic sunsets and sunrise... for breakfast, there's either coffee or tea only, personnally i need some creamy hot chocolate to start the day but there were none available, only as an extra, so i had to pay 5 euros extra on the 7euros all-inclusive buffet breakfast!!!Watch out for the boozy brittish slags around the bar/lounge, they can be messy with their beer..!####[['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'neutral'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]
ocation Location Location We stayed the night of the 18th May at the hotel in a dbl upgraded room, although as the previous correspondent said ,it didnt have a walk in shower, but the bathroom was lovely nonetheless. A very nice hotel, attentive staff - but expensive drinks. However, when you balance that with a very competitive 拢20.00 3 course price fixe menu it balances out. Breakfasts are also quite expensive, but we chose to eat a 100 meteres up the road at Marios, all inclusive for around a fiver, and very nice - allbeit not as grand as the Sofitel. I would stay at the hotel again, just for the beds !####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
great location Just come back from a weekend away in Amsterdam staying a the hotel Des Arts. he hotel is a clean but basic hotel, no tea / coffee facilities or hairdryers in the room, the rooms were of a decent size however our room was on the top floor accessed by a very steep spiral staircase, not good after a few drinks ! here are no lifts. Its location however was brilliant , right in the centre of the city just a 20 minute walk from the central station ( or 5 minute tram ride which stops right outside the hotel ) with all attractions easily within walking distance. he staff were also extremely helpful.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]

Entertainment team I visited Excellence Punta Cana DR, and I must comment on how great this resort is. he accomadations, amedities, food and most of all the entertainment, made this resort a return vacation in the future. I enjoyed all of the activities such as dancing, spanish lessons, aqua arobics, volleyball, and so much more. I don't think any of these activities would be possible with out the excellent entertainment staff, who went out of their way to say hello, include you in the activities, and just plain make it fun. It was was like the real life version of Dirty Dancing- minus the drama. hank you Mariel, Eliza and Jaun Carlo, just to name a few.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
he Anthill his place is huge - 1,600 rooms. It is a buzzing convention/meeting colony of people wearing name badges and corporate casual clothing. hat's all well and good, if that's your thing.

Disappointing We stayed at the Millennium Hotel our last night in Boston. he location is great, but the hotel was a disappointment. ur non-smoking floor smelled of cigar smoke, the room was small and dingy with stains on the carpet, the bed and pillows were uncomfortable and the hotel certainly needs some remodeling.

good value for the money I stayed at the hotel before when it was the Alisa. I got this room off of Priceline. he hotel appears to have renovated its rooms, including the bathrooms. While I was a little nervous from my previous trip to the Alisa, I was pleasantly suprised. ot that this is the Ritz-Carlton, but my room had a mini-fridge and microwave, with a bathtub and shower curtain around it.

Good location, but get an inside room he Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center  Pike Place Market. ur first room was on the street  was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. he courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early).

Hated the Water Club While size(small) and location (directly at beach near old San Juan) suited us well, the overall experience was terrible. While many very cool design features were distinctive the negatives far outweighed these, i.e. very small room, very loud street noises and blaring music from rooftop bar until wee hours of a.m., beat up old furniture and inferior sushi and tiny pool and pretentious eating area at pool that requires you buy a bottle of liquor in order to use large sofa like banquette seating. In all fairness, beds did provide lovely ocean view and staff were sincere and very helpful. ot enough reason to ever go back.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['facilities comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Good choice We stayed in this hotel when we travelled to Frankfurt to watch the World Cup. he hotel is in a good, central location. It is close to the main shopping district and about 10-15 minutes walk away from the main square and the main restaurants area. here are plenty of nice little restaurants right next to the hotel though. his is very much a business hotel with a clean, sophisticated reception area, very professional staff and good sized modern rooms and bathrooms. We booked well in advance on the hotel's website and were able to get the room for a very cheap rate - especially considering this is a four star hotel and the City was hosting the World Cup!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]

Probably wouldn't go back again - it was above average but only a typical business stop-over hotel.

Breakfast buffe not that good, and location a bit off perhaps. axis are cheap and easy to come by though so did not matter much.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'neutral'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

ute hotel, some construction, but comfortable and great value! he boyfriend and i stayed in this unique place due to him being in Seattle for business. It was a great location due to it being a bit off the beaten path from the business of the city yet close enough to walk everywhere I wanted to go. he rooms are incredibly large and for the price that we paid, we felt that we got a great bang for our buck! he comforter on the bed was really scratchy, and the front entrance to the hotel was under contstruction, but other than that, I would definitely reccomend this place to my friends and other travelers.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'neutral']]

Wonderful location We stayed at the Hotel Bigallo on the recommendation of a friend, and were not disappointed. It was an easy walk from the train station, even with our luggage, and a great location (the windows opened up to a very close view of the Duomo). It was an easy walk to everything in Florence. he room was spacious and attractive, and the breakfast OK. It was noisy outside, even at night (just shut the windows for quiet). here was an computer in the lobby you could pay to use for email, etc.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

clean hotel, great price Seattle was sold out, and this place got good enough reviews on tripadvisor, so I chose it. Good price, nice to be in the center of town.

uldn't wait to leave I've usually found the Marriotts to be fairly good, but this one was disappointing and just a notch above a Travel Inn. ocation was ok, but not central, as it was a good 15-minute walk to Dam Square and the Centraal Station. he hotel had absolutely no character whatsoever; the lobby was uninviting; and the food in both the breakfast and the bar restaurants was only just ok. he room was a good size, and the furnishings looked relatively new and comfortable, but there was a strong drainage smell in the bathroom all the time, and there was a fizzing electrical sound all through the night, which only went away when it was drowned out by the loud air con. When I mentioned this to the reception staff at check-out, they weren't interested and didn't even comment. nly go if you get a very cheap rate as you can get this sort of mediocrity anywhere.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
Don't Believe the Reviews - Read his First "The Terror of Tinytown" he staff is fine but the rooms here are so small as to defy belief.

Excellent hotel, excellent location Just on the site of the former Wall, this Hotel is a perfect jumping off point for everything to see and do in Berlin. Starbucks on block, train on corner. ur junior suite, while not luxuruous on the Four Seasons level, was extremely clean, comfortable and spacious. he Exec lounge is worth it for the extras---food and beverages and papers and internet and more.

Not bad at all I stayed at the Grant in 1998 and was fairly impressed enough to come back again in 2007. The rooms near the street were refurbished a couple of years ago, so I requested a room there. It's not as noisy as I thought. The room is pretty clean, especially the bathroom. It's a great no-frills place to stay that is central to many of the sights in S.F. Don't expect luxury here, but it's a great bargain nonetheless.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
It was fine! I stayed there for 2 nights on Jan 1st 2nd.the hotel was fully booked for regular rooms, so when i checked in i was upgraded to an executive floor, just for the room, not for the service.the hotel is just above a big shopping center with ok food, and a subway station which isn't the most convenient, but it will do.the room was clean, the service was ok, but definitely not something to write about either way, if you need a good hotel in HK, and Mongkok is your region take it, but only if they give a good price, i wanted to extend my stay but they gave me a ridiculous offer so I switched hotels.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

Service was simply excellent, prompt valet service, great concierge, helpful staff, excellent breakfast. The room was the largest I have ever had in NY, very well appointed and super clean.

As Per Great Reviews I booked this hotel on the basis of the consistantly good reviews given to it via Trip Advisor. The best thing about the hotel is the honesty and integrity of the staff which I have found lacking in some Venetian Hotels. I suppose this is understandable with the huge number of tourists there. It was very clean, quiet, the staff appear to enjoy their job and your presence and very good value for money. I will stay here again if I get the opportunity.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Beautiful, relaxing, great service. Loved the hotel...flew into Barcelona with my 5 year old daughter and stayed here our first 3 nights. After renting a car and heading out on a road trip of northern spain decided to book our last night here as well. My daughter was thrilled to be able to use the pool at the neighboring hotel - that she could see from our window. That hotel was much busier and we were thankful that although our hotel was geared more towards business folks that we felt very comfortable. Internet service is available on the bottom floor.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Smart Hotel, good location The hotel is in both a quiet and central location; 2 steps from the Vondelpark and 2 minutes from Leidersplein. The public areas are smart and modern and the rooms functional, clean but a bit small. We travelled with a baby and though a very clean and comfortable cot was waiting for him in our room, the lack of space and facilities like a kettle made things a bit difficult. The staff were all helpful and friendly and overall I would recommend it as a good city hotel, but perhaps more suited to singles / couples than families.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]

Even with remodeling going on, our stay at the Bienville House was wonderful! Our room was large, decorated with period furnishings/antiques and the bed was the most comfortable we have had at any hotel. The hotel was just as the pictures on the websites showed, the staff was friendly and helpful and even though the Heritage Cafe and Gamay Bistro were not open as the websites said, we had a wonderful stay at the Bienville House.

What a pleasure to sit and relax in this room having your breakfast with such a large choice of products among which ones also some Tuscany specialties... Our room had a very high ceiling with nice decorations, the ancient furniture was very elegant, bathroom was comfortable enough and very clean.

Horrific I had booked a room for 3 days this past February, and after reading some of the reviews here, I cancelled it. Thank goodness because when I saw it as I drove by on the highway, it looked pretty terrible. I should have been better about writing down all of the cancellation info, because a month later, they charged me for the room I didn't even stay in, and refuse to refund my money. Don't stay there - save yourself a headache. There are plenty of other affordable places to stay in San Juan without having to experience the unprofessionalism of this awful place.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

November 05 at the Westin Stayed two nights in Nov. 05. Room was very nice with Simmons Beautyrest bed that was very comfortable, nice big TV, good bathroom and towels. Only problems were that the safe was locked upon arrival and the maid took the robe on the 2nd night and didn't replace it. Mini bar as usual was very expensive and the place overcharges for things like the heath center and internet. Otherwise a good stay and better than the Millenium.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]

Great little place Good quality and value hotel. Rooms are clean and attractive for the price, and the bathrooms are very good. Breakfast buffet is value for money and good too! As it's near to the train station the area is just 'average' but it's a close walk to all the things you want to see so it's really not a problem. Overall, very good and would stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Nice place, bad food If you like bland food, cheap beer and rude Europeans - this is the place for you.11 of us just returned from a week in DR. The hotel was beautiful, but all of us were disappointed in the food and the drink selection. This is the first Caribbean resort I've stayed at that didn't have blenders behind the bar. Going back to Cozumel next time.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
OK hotel, Great Location This is a 2 star hotel (maybe??) with an excellent location. The rooms are on the shabby side - old paint, outdated upholstery, chipped furniture. But the location cannot be beat - steps from the entrance to Chinatown and a short walk to Union Square. And while the room was on the shabby side, it was clean!!!You can't beat the price, especially for the location.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
Fabulous Boutique Hotel A hotel that does what it is supposed to do. We had a wonderful suite with a comfortable bed and good climate control. The staff from the doorman to the floor maid and from the front desk to the shift manager were most accommodating and professional. There is a continental buffet breakfast in the lobby daily and a wine reception in the evening, both complimentary. The internet connection is free and works perfectly.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]

Hidden paradise in middle of the city When I make the reservation for this hotel I have no idea of the hidden paradise that I found in the middle of the city. This small hotel offers more than I expected. It has beautiful rooms with floors in marble and each bath has a jacuzzi bathtubs!! It has a enchanting patio with tropical flowers, terracota tiles and a marvlous mobiliary, a little but confortable pool and very kind personnel. Definitively I will visit this great place again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities, but since I came here on business, I needed an internet connection in my room. That service was sorely lacking. Not only that, the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them. This may sound insignificant, but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center, this hotel gets a big fat zero. Not only that, but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns. at the very least, i should've been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['room_amenities general', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Good hotel It is a good, clean, high end hotel in Beijing. Although I won't rate it as highly as it is hyped. Even service and concierage is not as great.

Its walking distance from Wangfujing and subway station which is a big plus.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors. No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality. Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled. Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Beautiful accomodations We stayed at The Legacy in September 2006 and found the accomodations to be very clean and beautifully decorated. There were two TV sets with DVD players, a kitchen, jacuzzi tub, dining room area, etc. The workout room was very well-equipped with up to date machines and TVs.

Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July. Rooms ok, clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes. We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room. Fridge and micro stuffed into the room, no place to eat except in bed. Similar to another review, we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners, demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia, and it was also not the place for asking questions. Location ok, a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we're used to walking.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'neutral']]
lean and good location but aimed at gay community. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor. For the money, it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were. It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street. The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls, sandwiches, croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost. Thoroughly recommended - you won't be disappointed.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St. Patricks day parade. I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel facillities are really good, including on site swimming pool, rooms are above average size, excellent beds, spotlessly clean, restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport (12 mins by cab) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group. In short, highly recommended and would definately stay there again when in Boston.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

Just the job Nice little hotel this, right on top of shopping, the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot. Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace. Rooms well appointed and breakfast adequate. Trying to get a drink from the hotel bar was a challenge but if you are not in a hurry you will get one.

Great Hotel Consistent Service, Not a Good Location Have stayed here a few times for business, and this hotel never disappoints. courtyard, pool and spa are an oasis in this concrete jungle. Rooms area clean and consistent and up to four seasons standards. Hotel not located in the best area of the city, and I would not recommend walking outside, even though there is a park closeby. Hotel is located in an area with alot of one way stalled traffic, so a real pain to get in and out of the hotel if you are trying to get to meetings or the airport to catch a flight.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Excellent location, low price The hotel was in an excellent location and perfect for anyone young, single, and traveling alone. Yes, the rooms are as tiny as all the reviews say, but you can't beat the location. And really, how much time do you actually spend in the room. The hotel staff was courteous. Although the restaurant next door can't compete with San Francisco's finest, Annabelle's was great for a quick meal at the end of a long day.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Ideal For Long Weekend First impressions of the hotel were excellent. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff who were keen to ensure that our stay in the hotel and Barcelona was as pleasant as possible. Our room was large, if basic, with a good standard of cleanliness. Due to the tiled floors the noise from corridors did tend to echo in our room however, this was not a particular problem that would put us off returning to the hotel in the future. The location is ideal for the tourist with limited time, very close to the centre but situated away from the noise of the main thoroughfare.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

It was better than we expected for the money; nice, big room, tiles and heat lamp in the bathroom, great location, very clean, and the helpful man at the front desk told us where to go and where not to go.

Sufficient I wouldn't necessarily go back to the Hostal R. Capitol, as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities: First, it is located right on the Ramblas, and there's hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs. Second, I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10:30 on a Friday night, arrive about an hour later ... and check out around 5:30 the following morning. The helpful gentleman at the front desk, on duty all night long, was undaunted by the unusual (but, in my case, necessary) hours. In short, this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations, but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch, Hostal R. Capitol suffices.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great to Relax We stayed just for the weekend the hotel is in a great location just minuets walk away from Dam square. The staff were very very friendly and helped in every way they could.

Vacationing at the Melia? Think again! The Melia Caribe, being a 5-star hotel, has very poor service and over-rated food.

Great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here over New Year for 3 nights and it is one of the best hotels we have stopped in. The service and attention to detail is amazing. If you get the chance, book an executive room as this gives you access to the exec lounge where there is a complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails and canapes in the evening. It was worth every penny!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
So comfortable! 15th July, 2006This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]

Be Warned: Polyester Sheets First of all, this place is really really cheap, so I feel a little bad complaining, also the staff were genuinely concerned when i brought this matter to their attention,however, the sheets here are some kind of polyester blend, so even though it may be freezing cold outside, you will not need to turn on the heat, you will sweat up a storm and wake up wet. I didn't sleep too well once i realized i was sleeping on a mattress that must be drenched with the sweat of a thousand previous guests.i would not stay here again, even with it being cheap.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Q We booked a four-night airfare/hotel package with Expedia,choosing the QC because of the mostly positive reviewson TripAdvisor.com, which turned out to be accurate. TheQ C will not knock your socks off, but it covers the basicbases handily: with a pleasant, clean room and a few pleasing extras like Bath and Body Works toiletries, a second magnifying mirror in the bathroom, etc. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. One drawback: we were put in the second building next door on Camp Street, and the room had permanently-sealed windows of frosted, pebbled glass -- gave kind of a claustrophobic effect.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]

fabulous! We arrived at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne with high expectations, which could have really set us up for a disappointment. Fortunately, we were even more impressed than we thought we would be. The staff was very helpful, always smiling, and the room was wonderfully clean, with a distant view of the Sacre Coeur from the balcony (on the fourth floor). It is close to the pyramides metro station, so it's easy to navigate the city from its location. I'm not sure that I will choose a pricier hotel in Paris, because this hotel has so much to offer--all the more reason to splurge on some fantastic French food!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Think the HI is getting a bad rap I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of April. My room was spotless (despite what some reviewers have written), and while the bathroom was small, the shower itself was roomy, the hotel bath linens of very good quality and a working iron and ironing board in the closet. The staff was very friendly, very helpful and willing to work with a little Spanglish if communication broke down. I, for one, like not being in a property facing Ashford (it was much quieter) and still less than a block from everything on Ashford. Breakfast every AM in a room facing the pool (which only gets sun in the AM BTW) was good with pastries, juice and coffee. All in all, more than I expected from a Holiday Inn at a reasonable prepurchase rate.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive']]

More than adequate for its class We stayed in the Monna Lisa for 4 nights in early December and had a positive experience. This is not a luxury hotel, but given the price we had no complaints. The street is a quiet one and the location, near the Duomo and on the same street as La Giostra Restaurant is very convenient. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with, graciously providing information and making reservations for us for dinners and tours.

Still my favourite - but... This is definately my favourite hotel in Paris (considering my budget).Great location, friendly staff, surprising design features, nice rooms, clever lay out, but... we were lucky. Friends travelling with us stayed in the same hotel, at the same rate but didn't really get what we got. They walked into a really tiny and a little run down room, and the bathroom was very tiny and didn't 'feel' clean. So picking this hotel is like playing the lottery. You can get lucky - like we did, or you can be less lucky like our friends.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Stay here! This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms (we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious). Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly. I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars. I would have rated it higher and I'm very picky about hotel accomodations.

Memorable Stay! Our recent stay in Boston was made even better by the Millenium Bostonian. We found the staff warm, friendly, and very efficient. One night we opened the door to our tiny but delightful balcony and fell asleep to the sounds of the city. Our view of Faneuil Hall was a plus. After six days, I am ready to make the MB my hotel of choice in Boston!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Nice Place I satyed four nights at the hotel for a conference and found it to be a fine establishment. I was in a distant section that made access to the lobby and conference section quite a hike but was near to the spa and pool which proved to be an advantage. The pool is immense and, as a swimmer, was most welcome. The food was tasty and well presented and the location was very convenient for access to lots of transportation and local activities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Great Stop over place We had to stay overnight to wait for another business partner. This was the quitest hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything is located in the airport, resturants, and a shopping mall. You can rent cars, or catch a local, or high speed train. It's not central to the city, but it has all modes of transportation avalalible to you.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict']]
Great find - family hotel in the heart of New York City Found this hotel quite by accident and what a find... Location is just off times square - right in the middle of the action. Hotel is themed on North African theme and it completely works, the friendly attentitive staff actually seem to care about your well being and you don't feel as though you are a corporate number. In particular the free cheese and wine every evening helps to make you night out complete, they do this because they don't (didn't) have a liquor licence.breakfast is continental style - but again included in the price. The rooms are big (for New York) and a welcome change from the chain hotels - with fans as well as the usual AC. The only downside was leaving - great place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Very good I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated. I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must. The rooms are quite small (the bathroom especially), but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days. There was a regular free bus into town, and it's only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay (about 30 mins to Orchard Road).Happily stay again, although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'positive']]
>Sleep on a cloud This is my second stay at the Angeleno Hotel in Brentwood. While the rooms are ok for a stylish hotel, it is the bed and bedding that makes staying here a pleasure.

Artus is Great for Romance We stayed at the Artus for just one night and booked the junior suite. It was fabulous, newly refurbished with a great bathroom and balcony overlooking the rooftops of Paris. The hotel is in an good location and Sanjay gave us an excellent recomendation for dinner and was very helpful throughout. Highly recommended!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
worthwhile I was surprised at how nice this hotel was, given the horrible experience I had at another hotel in Amsterdam that had the same star rating. It was really nice. Rooms were large by European standards, and the bathrooms had heated floors.

The best hotel and location in Barcelona Amazing place to stay-no need to look elsewhere. If you're young and you like to be in a cool neighbourhood with lots to do, this is your playground.

look no further Wonderfull place to stay. Especially for romnantic weekends. All the other reviews are right; super atmosphere, high ceilings, delicious breakfast and small-scale charm.

One more great experience Spent three nights here in early May. I just read the last few reviews and see no point in repeating what others have eloquently said already. I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth and say that this is a wonderful hotel that reflects its city. Well worth the expense.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Good restaurant In total I was there several weeks. The people from the restaurant did much more than their best, good food. Overall service was OK, although there was a hick-up, but the people from the restaurant restored that. Very negative: the beds: too soft!!! Also when you stay in a room you think at night that someone is breaking into your room, but it's just your neighbor that is entering his/her room.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Perfect Madrid Accommodation My friend and I stayed at Cruz Sol in July after having made an internet booking months in advance. When our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hostal at 2am, we were welcomed in and shown to our room which was exactly as stated on their website. The rooms were clean and secure with extra conveniences such as a hair dryer, safe, patio and a decent sized bathroom. Very central location with fabulous bars and restaurants nearby. Very affordable accommodation -would recommend it to anyone!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Smiley's Restaurant We didn't stay at the hotel, but ate at the attached restaurant. It was, by far, the best meal we had in Rincon. The atmosphere is very romantic and the service was great. OUr meal took a little longer because of a big party and the waiter bought our drinks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more romantic night out.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great Base for City Visit Stayed at The Prescott for two nights. The location near Union Square is extremely convenient for shopping around the Square and in the excellent Westfield Centre, the cable cars along Powell towards Fisherman's Wharf and Muni along Market towards Embarcadero. The staff were friendly and efficient providing information, printing out boarding passes, storing luggage and providing a town car to the airport. The room was not large but the furnishings, bedding and bathroom were all of a high standard. We would readily stay at The Prescott agai####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
Lovely hotel I wanted a great hotel in Amsterdam with a pool for a leisure stay. The Amstel was the most fantastic place to stay; cost an arm and a leg but worth it if you can afford it. Great room, food, service, nothing at all to complain about. I was a little worried about the distance from the centre of Amsterdam but needn't have been - the trams are fast and frequent and even to walk isn't that bad. Would highly recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict']]

Fantastic!!!!! Went to this hotel for Valentines weekend, as soon as we arrived we were very impressed as they upgraded us for Free!. The hotel is fantastic and very clean. The staff at the hotel were always very helpful and friendly. This hotel is in a perfect location, and what better way to enjoy it than to go back for a swim and sauna at the end of a busy day. While you are in Paris I would definately recommend going for a meal along the River Seine, and also a meal in the Pavillion Elysee restaurant (along the champse elysee).When I visit Paris again I will stay here again!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Be very aware of the location This is a lovely restored hotel on Market Street in San Fancisco. The problem is that it's the wrong end of Market Street. It's a good price for the center of San Fran but only go out at night with a minder. And don't use their valet car parking service -they'll damage your car.####[['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
unbelievably unhelpgul!! I am staying at Spaulding at the moment. We only have a few days so we wanted to quickly arrange some trips - but the extremely unfriendly receptionist has flatly refused to help us, or even let us use the phone to call the tour companies. We have no phone, the internet is too slow, so we're now setting off to macy's third floor to find a payphone. I am speechless!!####[['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative']]
Once is enough If this is a 5-star hotel, I'm a monkey's uncle! I'll give it 3-stars on a good day. The rooms are dated although ours was good sized and with a nice view over the Dam. Staff were not necessarily rude, but useless and incompetent at best, although I think this was simply because the staff just did not care. Got a good deal on the internet, but wish I would've paid more and gone somewhere else.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great place to stay We stayed for 7 nights in a Junior suite. Only has positive things to say about the Affinia Dumont -staff were excellent, professional and friendly the room was spotless and large, bathroom  kitchen were fine for our needs and the king size bed was great.

an't wait to return to UMA Stayed at the UMA for 2 nights in a terrace room and emerged totally relaxed and recharged. Was lucky to catch the hotel in low season, place was utterly serene and prob only saw a handful of other guests around the entire time. Restaurant, poolbar and front desk staff were friendly and helpful. What I really appreciated:5mins walk from Mozaic (must be the best restaurant in Bali)Pool is a good length could be 25metresFree transfers to town from morning to nightResort is lush and green with lots of plants  flowersComo shambhala toiletriesNo major issues with the hotel except that there were flies by the poolside, which makes it inconvenient if you want to leave your food /drink unguarded while you take a dip.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Great Location My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our way back to the UK. Plus points - The hotel is in a great location on Union Square and the inside of the hotel looked very nice.

Overall though I did like this hotel and would stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
mfortable and well equipped Great location for exploring the latin quarter and St Germain, but still an easy walk into the centre of Paris. We just used it as a crash pad, so were barely here.

Majestic marvelous If you want the best location in Barcelona as well as friendly, professional service - you must stay at the Majestic! Rooms are spacious and comfortably decorated.

Location Location Location Superb location, near shops, resturants, very good area as far as Barcelona goes. We walked to many of the main sights in Barcelona from the hotel.

Will always return... I have stayed here a number of times (for weeks at a time) and have had not only superior service but excellent accomodations.

Terrific Location We stayed at this hotel on our first 4 nights in Australia. The view of Darling Harbour from the room was amazing. The hotel room was excellent in everyway. The location to transport, the harbour, bars, restaurants and ferries couldn't have been better.

pretty standard, good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005. The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent. We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls, but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in. We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor. The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Highly Recommend Had a great time staying here, the staff were super friendly from the minute we arrived. Very clean hotel and rooms located extremely close to Union Square and even had a starbuck attached to the building. Also close to car hire firms and main shopping area. Concierge also had greeat locval knowledge or resturants and shops. I would recommend We loved it We had a great time there.

No character but overall worth the money Well positioned hotel (Prudential stop on the subway) - not a lot to recommend it from a character point of view but has excellent facilities - especially the beds that are enormous.

Good hotel - but watch your wallet This hotel has character and is in an excellent location. The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices, huge menu, very popular. Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife's purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned. Obviously we shouldn't have left the money in the room, but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street. Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel, sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses/wallets, leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room. The hotel (and cleaner) were no doubt banking (correctly) that we wouldn't bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station!####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Loved the Hotel de Varenne This was a wonderful and cute hotel with great staff. The rooms were immaculate, the breakfast was great and the little courtyard so nice.

Excellent room and service The room was excellent, and the staff very friendly and helpful, speaking perfect English. They also arranged a doctor to visit the hotel to see our young daugther, and then also interpreted. My only observation is that you probably don't need to book a canal room as there's not a huge amount to see out of the windows. You'll enjoy the stay####[['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great Hotel, no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels. The room (76) was elegant and clean, and the location was perfect. The only negative aspects of our stay were the construction across the street (noise) and the fact that the Monkey Bar was closed for renovation (no mention of this on the hotel website).

Not so bad... I went with the expectations of a horrible experience because of the reviews, but it wasn't so bad...

Clean Room / Great Location / Excellent Price I was entirely satisfied with my stay at the Prince Conti. I was shocked to find a safe and clean room at a price as low as the Prince Conti's midweek rates. While the hotel may lack some of the amenities of the 5-star New Orleans hotels, it is still an ideal place to catch your breath before heading back out to the Quarter or the Faubourg Marigny. It is clean, comfortable, and affordable.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
Great Hotel ,perfect location I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice. The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower, i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for ,to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out. As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent, i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her. As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep, although there are plenty of buses ,cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy. I booked with hotel connect a uk website which were 拢400 cheaper on my booking than any other website. Room service is expensive but breakfast in you room is nice, go on treat yourself ,your on holiday.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

John And Nessie on Our Honeymoon We arrived Tuesday afternoon on our honeymoon to be greeted by very friendly staff, we had lovely fresh fruit brought to the room on arrival,we asked to change the room for one where we could see and hear the sea,no problem,very helpfull. The beach is supurb (Like the bounty advert) lovely warm sea,very safe to wonder around,plenty of sun loungers,and parasoles for shade,the food is very good plenty of choice, breezes is a very clean and kept clean hotel the staff are very pleasent and very helpful,We would recommend taking a box of PG tips and a couple of bars of Cadburys and any other required pleasures, that can't be bought out there,you will be ripped off buying things in the hotel. The country side is very plush and green breath taking scenery and well worth taking an excursion out and experiencing the local culture.

Great value The rooms are pretty old, but clean. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from union square and market street.

Terrible elevator... The room was fine as well as the location of the hotel (not too far from city centre). However, there were 2 big problems disappointing me: noise on the outside and a constant beeping from the elevator door throughout the night whenever the door opened.

Sweet and over the top and worth it This is a small place, close to what you will want to see, even for old hats of Paris.

The standard room is not so big, but if you store your clothes in the closet and put your suitcases under the bed, you really feel like home!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral']]
Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have picked a nicer spot. We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which, for us, encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit. We had a very 'Florentine' room with a view' and a great bed, the best of friendly attention from our hosts, a good breakfast and a super location. In the grim early- winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland, we think about our 'time out' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return. Thanks for everything.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Fantastic hotel, fantastic city Planned a four week vacation to Australia and found trip advisor to be totally helpful to me, felt like I should share my experience. Hotel is great, great location, really comfortable beds, especially after flight from the UK. Darling Harbour is great for restaurants and bars and hotel is within 2 mins walk. Go to the Blue Mountains in Sydney and use Oz Trails for the trip - superb. Have a great trip.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
They won us over We weren't sure about this hotel at first - it needs a bit of TLC and a lick of paint in some areas, but the staff made it for us. We didn't see one rude member of staff - all were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is extremely well located and being on the fourth floor we didn't hear any noise at all - even though Barcelona had just won the league and the streets were alive with cheering mobs of football fans when we arrived! I would definately stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Excellent Booked this hotel a couple of months in advance due to travelling to diferrent places in america. On entering the hotel i was already lost due to had to go to the 8th Floor to check in. Checking in was very easy and the people in the hotel very helpful on where to go what to see and what lines to take on the trains etcOn entering the room i was gobsmacked Very spacious, Clean and the view was incredible (33rd Floor)Overall i cannot rate this hotel highly enough due to you are bang in the centre of times Would centainly stay there again and recommend to any####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral']]
Wonderful hotel The staff of this hotel was so helpful and nice, it really set our stay out on the right foot. Our room was large and bright with plenty of toiletries and towels and robes for my husband, child and me. Room was very clean.

Fastastic Value and convenient to airport. This reasonably priced hotel was the surprize of our trip. The hotel is located less than a block from SEA-TAC an has 24 hour shuttle. Coast appears to have undergone a recent remodel, and the did an excellent job. Located on International Blvd and next to the airport I was surprized to find that neither the street noise nor air-traffic were loud. Several nearby restuarants, and the hotel had a very good free breakfast.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Loved it - would definatly stay again. We really liked this hotel. Good room, great restaurants nearby and good cocktails in the bar, not far from Old Street station. We have had roadside rooms in other london hotels which have been very noisy. Because of the good double glazing this is not a problem at the Hoxton. The place is clean stylish and if you get a room deal great value for money.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

uld not have been more pleased.... After relying on Trip Advisor (once again) we booked a 4-day stay at Iberville Suites and could not have been more pleased, The location is perfect - 1 block from Bourbon Street and all the action - but the QUIETEST hotel we have ever stayed in! All of the employees we came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fine - but of course one day you'll want to go to Cafe Dumond for those amazing beignets. The rooms are very, very clean and it truly is a suite - separate sitting area, 2 TVs, etc. We would most definitely return.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]

very nice airport hotel Was very pleased with this hotel. Rooms are very large, well appoingted but with plenty of space for luggage etc. Breakfast was more than adequate, with made-to-order omelets, and the whole facility was immaculate and actually worked! Only negatives we noted were shuttle service from LAX is on request which we didn't know and lost some time waiting curbside before calling, and if you rent a car or drive, note that hotel parking is $15.00 per nite. Since it is very close to the airport the aircraft noise might bother light sleepers/children.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'conflict'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
p notch in the capital Our stay at Hotel 41 was a delight, from the time we walked in the front entrance to our departure. All the staff were very polite, attentive and seemed to take genuine pleasure in meeting all our needs and indeed, exceeding our expectations with all the special touches that made our stay memorable. The rooms were of the highest standard and the attention to detail in ensuring our comfort was delightful. We went to celebrate my fortieth birthday and will remember hotel 41 for all the right reasons for many years to come. We wil definately be returning in the future and have no hesitation in recommending this haven to others!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
Not a bad pllace to stay We needed a fairly inexpensive place near the Quarter and found the Courtyard. We arrived not knowing what to expect. While it was not luxurious it was clean, the pool/courtyard area were fantastic and easy to get to, and the staff was friendly and bent over backwards to help make our stay enjoyable. No matter where your room is, you are close to street level and traffic could be noisy at night. The continental breakfast was small, but it was available all morning long and the coffee was great! While it's not the Ritz, it's not a bad place to stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Very Good Stayed here for business in Brooklyn, the location was great, just a block from where I was working. Overall a great hotel, well maintained and very clean (especially when compared to previous experiences in 'upscale' Manhattan hotels).Food was very good, and restaurant/bar staff friendly. My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door. This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts, in my experience (maybe with all hotels as well, but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts.) A fussy toddler kept me awake until 1:30AM, ugh. Beautiful views from the Concierge Lounge, and presumably from bridge-view rooms.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Brilliant Hotel Thanks for the great ideas I got from your site - we had a brilliant holiday in the U.S. I've travelled extensively over the past 35 years and lived in 6 countries - the Omni in Frisco is my new favourite hotel- it was worth every penny - they got the little things so right and were charming and helpful hosts - the room was spotless and well appointed and the location is good.

Newly fitted room, expensive breakfast It鈥檚 a big hotel in the middle of the city. Quite old even if the room and bathroom are newly fitted. Nice selection beauty products and it鈥檚 possible to choose the most comfortable pillow. It鈥檚 quite an anonymous, therefore, if you鈥檙e looking to something with a traditional Dutch atmosphere it鈥檚 not the hotel for you. Breakfast is incredibly expensive and it鈥檚 better to go to one of the bakeries or cafes鈥?around.

Great Stay Wondeful hotel in Florence! A little out of the way (but still can walk to everything in 10 minutes or less). Front desk was great - had to check out very early so when I called for a wake-up call, the operate ordered a cab for me to arrive at a certain time and they packed a breakfast for me (because I'd miss the free breakfast).

Not bad Hotel was about 20-25 minute walk to the centre of Florence. The room was clean, with a good shower and the staff were friendly. The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests 'coming and going'. It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep. Probably wouldn't stay here again for that reason.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
wonderful hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the Argonaut - our second stay here. The hotel's location at the end of Fisherman's Wharf and almost next to Ghirardelli Square is just about perfect for vacationing travelers - very convenient, yet quiet. Service is excellent, beds are extremely comfortable, and rooms are well decorated and clean. The hotel's restaurant, Blue Mermaid, is very good (although we liked Capurro's across the street better for breakfast). The bowls of fruit in the lobby and the wine hour in the afternoon are great added touches that make you feel good that you decided to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
uld be better Just got back from a week in Seattle and loved almost every minute of it. The Pacific Plaza, while a good buy, could use some improvement. We were on the top (8th floor) and all the heat in the builidng seemed to rise into our room. Also, while the room was non-smoking, the internal ventilation system seemed to draw in smoke from other rooms.

Great experience! We stayed at this hotel for three nights in total. The first on our arrival in Phoenix prior to our driving tour round and were so impressed we reserved a room for the nights prior to flying back out of Phoenix to Holland. Everything was clean, the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful - from giving us milk at 2am to help us sleep as we were jet lagged to arranging the shuttle bus to take us to Mills avenue so we could go for a night on the town!!Having toured round for two weeks the amenities and service here were not beaten along our travels - high speed internet, breakfast, pool, spa, vending machines, fridge, microwave.

Disappointing Husband and I had a one night stopover in Singapore en route to London from Australia. Expedia recommended this hotel as a 'good deal'. It was certainly well-located, in the heart of the shopping district, but the hotel was run down and the room frankly shabby with threadbare carpets and beaten up furnature. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, the staff barely understood English. Not recommended unless you really do get it at bargain price, which we did not.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Great value for money I stayed here 2 years ago and whilst I knew that the rooms can be shabby, due to the location and an excellent deal at $70 per night (inl breakfast) I thought it was worth the money. We seem to have lucked out though and got a far superior room to the one we had before (or they've just decorated!)and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. If you want an average 3* which is definitely a hotel and not a hostel, I would recommend and stay here again.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Loved the location Just came back from spending New Years in NYC. The Marquis was the BEST hotel to be at for New Year's Eve. We were allowed exclusive access to Times Square for the ball drop at midnight. Our room key was our key to Times Square that evening. We couldn't cross Broadway without it.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great Rooms, Good Location, Pricey Very nice 1 bedroom suite in a great location near shopping and subway. Staff very friendly. This was a business junket, so we didn't have to pick up the tab. I think it was around $400/night. I could never afford to stay here on my own, but it was fun for just this one time.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Very Bad Service This hotel has the worst service. Even though it is in near downtown I would strongly suggest you stay somewhere else where they treat you with respectful service.

A sanctuary amongst inferior hotels After a horrific experience at the LaFayette hotel down the street, my coworker and I went back to the familiar comfort of the Marriott. We were greeted by very friendly doormen and someone came and took our luggage that we had to carry up the street in the rain. In fact, they were so nice that when I tripped over a drain cover that was in the parking lot, the doorman immediately went and got a screwdriver and fastened the cover to the ground! The desk workers were equally friendly and put us in a great room. It may not seem like much, but it's the small things that make a stay incredible, and this one definitely was worthy of the marriott name!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
xcellent hotel I have just return from a long weekend stay at the Eden Rembrandt Square hotel and it was perfect, the staff were lovely, the room was gorgeous and the bathroom was really modern! it was in a very good location close to all bars, coffee shops and resturants but still quiet!

Best location and very nice rooms The Herbert Hotel is located close to the Union Square, the very center of SF, and on Powell Street. The hotel is new-decorated from top-to-tow and has a 4-stars-hotel room standard. You have everything just around the corner and a very good location for all attractions in the city, including BART, bus and cable car. PS! 28th April a Betty Boop Restaurant opened on the ground floor.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
i would rather sleep in my car i fly and stay at hotels a lot... this has got to be on my top 5 worst! the staff was rude, the elevator was broke, the room was disgusting and the ambiance was...well, ghetto. there were drug deals going on in daylight and ladies soliciting beside them. the place is rundown and needs a good cleaning. stay away and spend your dollar a bit further away from the airport.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative']]

Worst ever This is the worst hotel I have stayed in during my twenty years of travel. Spraying for insects( had to leave the door open to clear the fumes), water didn't work, holes in linens( if there were any), beds not clean and the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in days, waited for 1 1/2 hours for the quick shuttle from the airport and then the driver asked us to lift the luggage because it might be too heavy for his back. . Never - stay here - ever.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Fantastic hotel in This hotel was a pleasant surprise in New Orleans. I'd never stayed in a Drury hotel, and now I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The lobby was lovely, there was a full hot breakfast, sodas available during the day, staff was friendly, beds were comfortable and room was clean with marble tiles in entrance and bathroom. Most importantly, all Drury hotels are pet friendly, and my dog had a great time looking out our 8th floor window at the streets of New Orleans. It was a short walk to the french quarter, and the streetcar lines are right outside the door.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Nice Hotel, Nice Location, A Little Dated Stayed here for two nights in February. Was a nice hotel, with great views, but the rooms felt small and older. I'd suggest requesting the newer tower (there are two towers to the hotel) when booking. Overall, a nice property, but not worth more than $160ish per night in my opinion. I'd look around and see what else is out there, if the rate is exceeding $160ish.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Back again! On our trip through Mexico we stayed three nights at the NH Hotel Mexico City. Everything was excellent: a very clean and calm room (on the ninth floor), with all comfort you can imagine (till toothbrushes, toothpaste, wax for shoes, ...), the breakfast buffet was tremendous and the staff was friendly and competent (spoke even french!). We felt that in this hotel all is made so that the customer feelshimself well. Be sure that, if once we come again to Mexico, we will stay at the NH.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Pleasant Surprise This hotel was definitely a pleasant surprise. White the room was a bit small/tight, it was very well redone, with an absolutely awesome view of the beach. While it is a block from the beach, there's not much in between to kill the view. The lobby is OK - a bight tight, and the Mezz floor is low celienged (very 1970's!), but the rest of the place is very nice, and well priced. Would definitely recommend it over most others in Waikiki - unless you really want to stay right on the beach and pay a lot more.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great location, terrible rooms! The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It is just around the corner from Nathan Street which is ideal for any shopaholics and there is an underground station a minute鈥檚 walk away from the hotel. The Kowloon Hotel is a very busy hotel which caters for business people and tourists alike. As I say the location is excellent but the rooms are just tiny and not particularly pleasurable to be in either I鈥檓 afraid. However, if you don鈥檛 plan to be in the room much and are looking for somewhere central to explore Hong Kong (as we were) and without forking out a small fortune for a more exclusive hotel, then this hotel is worth considering.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Great place to My grandson, daughter, sister and myself spent five nights at the hotel, we were on the second floor inside room and loved the quiet of the room, we can not said enough good things about this hotel.

lose to perfection I stayed in the Royal Park for 4 weeks on a lengthy business trip. In short, this is probably the finest business hotel I have ever stayed in. A few of the things I loved: a nicely decorated, spacious room; a PC with free internet access (in the room); a metro station directly under the hotel; a nice selection of glasses in the room (tall, tumbler, wine etc.); great food from the many hotel restaurants; a wide range of toiletries; a fantastic shower; free use of a DVD playeror BOSE music system on request; 8 types of pillow to choose from (!) and finally, impeccable service from all the staff. If you are planning a trip to Tokyo, for business or pleasure, bypass all the obvious chain hotels and give this little gem a try.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities miscellaneous', 'positive']]

Westin went above and beyond A friend and I just got back from a 3 night stay in the Westin Palace in Madrid. Unfortunately the last 2 days I came down with an intestinal infection.

couldn't wait to leave this hotel although the views from our room were drop dead gorgeous we were completely bored at the Mandarin Oriental and felt isolated in a sterile cube. the room furnishings lacked the austere beauty I'd been hoping for - the room's furnishings were quite plain and unremarkable. we were in a bridge to bridge view room - expensive - but we didn't feel pampered or special while staying at the hotel in any way. room service food was quite plain; good quality ingredients but not particularly delicious or gourmet. we actually felt a bit depressed in this hotel, we couldn't wait to leave - so we checked out a day early.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'conflict']]

With many Boston hotels averaging $250 per night, we had a perfectly acceptable king-size room for just under $100 including parking.

Great location The hotel is very charming and takes on the modern architectural feel of Barcelona. The room itself is small, and leave a good deal to be desired.

Really fantastic This hotel is in an excellent location for visiting London and the tube is just a short walk away on the same street. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very new and modern - it has a boutique feel to it. There is plenty of choice for breakfast, although it does cost 拢21 if it's not included in your price, which is a bit steep. There are 3 or 4 cafes, aswell as an MS food shop, across from the hotel that you could eat breakfast in. Would recommend this hotel without a doubt.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

My son had the room in his name but eventhough his two traveling companions had their passports,they could not get into their room until he arrived in the evening.

single room double price I had booked a double room through a website, then I called to check if there was a single available as I was going to be on my own. They said fine, no problem, but don't bother to cancel the original booking. We'll take care of it when you arrive. When I got there I was given a very small room with just ONE single bed, so I expected a single room rate as well. But when I checked out I realized that was not the case. Single room, double price.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
The view is worth the money Our decision to upgrade to a room in the tower with a bay view was worth every penny!

Great Rooms, Noisy Location We spent 4 nights at this hotel in Madrid. The hotel itself is in excellent condition and our room was clean and very comfortable. You could easily walk to all the sights from this location, which made it convenient. The breakfast was top notch as was the lovely rooftop bar. The hotel staff were nice, but were not at all helpful in recommending restaurants. The downside of the hotel is that it is on a very noisy street and there are many very aggressive vagrants who lurk around the hotel, not to mention hookers who work the area in the evening.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict']]

The food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpfull and also very knowledgeable about the menus, wine and food. I am a qualifed Chef and my wife and I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world including what is listed as THE best restaurant in the world at the moment by renowned Chefs, The Fat Duck in Bray, UK and found the food and service in The Torres to be of an extremely high standard.

Surely they rented the room twice that night (April 20) and somebody pocketed some easy money!I want a refund.

We booked with hotwire and had standard rooms, no bugs(!), and we want to return in 2 years for our 30th.

I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard. This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful. Maybe I got unlucky, but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics, I decided to leave the property all together. The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch. Although the bar is nice and the breakfast, the one day I did stay, was excellent, I've become accustomed to a higher standard and comfort from my room.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Great Value and location Have stayed here several times and always try to book if possible. All rooms are suites and even the smallest is great for two people or the business treaveler. Clean and safe (gated parking garage attached to hotel) with great near downtown location. Access to major interstates, American Center for concerts and Downtown. Good value and great location.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
BEST TIME OF MY LIFE Me and my girlfriend spent a week at the Villas and it was beautiful. We stayed at apt 2A and I could not belive how all I had to do to beat to the beach was walk down a flight of steps. I recomend these villas to anyone who is planning on going to Culebra. Air Comditioned rooms right on the beach... what else can you ask for?####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]

Friendly, helpful staff This Hotel is located near Moulen Rouge, with small but adequate rooms. The staff were VERY HELPFUL, even the manager offered to allow us to leave our big luggage there for a small trip to London. Also all staf spoke english, which was a big plus!!!! In fact the only reason I would return to Paris is because of the great service we got at the hotel and the pub next door, everywhere else seemed unfriendly and offered little help. Small tip the BREAKFAST is NOT INCLUDED, it's quite expensive at 12 euros.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Great price and good location This motel has always been a favorite due to its location near Folsom Street and nightlife - but is even better now that its been given a AAA one-diamond rating and upgraded the rooms. Prices are good value even booking direct. Breakfast in the morning was good with bagels, etc. and decent coffee. 24 Hour staff was always helpful.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Loved the Clift Trendy hotel, centrally located in Union Square area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Loved the furniture in the lobby especially the tall high chair, check it out. The buffet breakfast was wonderful. Only complaint was the television in the room was too small. Otherwise, i definitely recommend this cool, chic hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative']]
The best around for the budget traveler My stay at Cosmo Hotel was everything that I was looking for. I found the hotel to be well-furnished, clean, and well-located.

Not a typical W W is not as good as other W's in other cities. I have stayed at several and though the SF version is nice, I don't think it measures up to W standards. Pricey, so so location and SMALL rooms. A little dirty and compared to other W's, awkward.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative']]
Great location, clean with helpful staff We booked for 4 nights in mid-September as we had previously stayed here 3 years ago. Since then the hotel has been given a face-lift. The rates were higher than normal (we booked through a NL hotel booking site online) due to a big conference taking place during the week but even though they were all busy, the staff were helpful and friendly. For an extra 25 euros a night you can upgrade on arrival to a superior room (50 euros for a deluxe) which is well worth doing if you can! We asked for a room at the front and found it was well sound proofed even though you had the trams and nightlife til late!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Not that bad the hotel is not that badi was staying there with my 5 friends and they gave us a 5-bed-room with private bathroom the room was not lovely, but absolutely good for sleeping after parties in Amsterdamthe best thing is its location - is in the very centry of Amsterdam, so everything is near... we appreciated it when we were returning from clubs (which are absolutely amazing there... )so dont be affraid of mice :))####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Super hotel in great location A friend recommended that I use Trip Advisor to search online for hotels and I'm so glad I did. My original booking for a Paris hotel showed a dismal rating so when this gem of a hotel showed up I booked it straight away. The hotel was so clean,comfortable and quiet and I would definitely stay there again if I visit Paris in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
This has to be a best kept secret Stayed at the St Marie from April 8 thru April 11, 2005. Accommodations were clean and comfortable. Room was spacious and overlooked the courtyard. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. Located 1/2 block off Bourban Street and 3 blocks from Jackson Square, it's close enough to the fun and far enough away from the smells and noise when you're through for the day.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
absolute rip off Pretty good by the book for the star rateing EXCEPT the HOWARD JOHNSON part. I was charged more for an international call that lasted barely 1 minute to Australia by the HOWARD JOHNSON organisation than I paid for the room!!!!!!! Beware local calls dialed through the hotel system are very inexpensive BUT by the telephone in the room are instructions to make international calls useing your credit card. I did this, the conections are made thru US, thru the HOWARD JOHNSON org. and that as far as I'm concerned is a RIP OFF.####[['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years. In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags. The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening, did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them, begging to be let in. The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities, as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk. Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative']]
Perfect for a short break in Paris A charming, small hotel in an excellent position directly opposite the Pantheon. We greatly enjoyed our two nights here. The staff were very helpful and the room small but immaculate.

Loved Le Pavillion We go to New Orleans frequently for business and for pleasure. This was the first time that we had stayed at Le Pavillion. It was wonderful! The staff was personable and professional. The room was a little small, but if you are in New Orleans you are not in your room that much. I can definitely say that Le Pavillion will be our hotel of choice from now on.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Beyond 5 stars I am 57 years old and have travelled extensively and stayed in many beautiful hotels, but the Drake Hotel now sits at the top of my list. From the moment I arrived until I left, my stay was beyond my wildest expectations - absolutely fabulous hotel, room was amazing and a staff that went above and beyond what one could imagine. Jonathan Leclaire should write a how to book for all hotel managers around the world. Beautiful food, people, location, ambiance - please do yourself a favor and try this hotel - you will not be sorry.

Rather Disappointed! Dear Reader,after our recent one night stay at the Bali Hyatt, we unfortunately have to confirm the negative review written by LukePerth dated Nov 18, 2008. Our room was very humid and loud, which may relate to the structural set-up of the hotel property. We think that it could be worthwhile to invest some more $$$ and stay at the Sheraton Laguna Beach Resort in Nusa Dua.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Very good hotel We booked this hotel for the last night of our vacation using our Marriott rewards points. We didn't expect much but it actually turned out great. The bed was comfortable, the room was nice and the restaurant nearby they suggested at the front desk was excellent. We used the computer to map our way to a few places and were able to use the printer there for free.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Above Average Hotel Stayed for three nights in June 2005. Slightly overrated. While the rooms were clean and modern (plasma t.v., purified water in the bathroom), they are very small. Hotel guests are mostly white Americans, not that that is a bad thing but being in the hotel, you would never know you were in China (except for the staff). Great location, excellent service, clean/modern facilities, good Western-style restuarant for buffet breakfast, luxury shopping within the hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Nice Hotel Nice hotel to stay while on a girls getaway. Located just outside the French Quarter. It was a clean hotel, nicely decorated, however the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small, so if your traveling with 4-5 women you may want a larger room. It was about a 10 minute walk from the Quarter, which is not bad, but it was a bit scary at 2 in the morning. Quaint bar. For the great rate they charge it is worth staying.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Good budget hotel I thought this was a good hotel for the money. It's clean, the staff were helpful and it is very centrally located. I loved having a fridge in the room cause I stocked that with some wonderful ham and cheese shortly after my arrival. I thought the breakfast was very good, and you don't need to get up early as they serve it until pretty late. There is also a computer for internet access which was helpful. Overall, I had a very good stay here.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Double Charged! While the hotel itself was nice, I was deeply troubled when the Hotel billed me twice for the 2 night stay. The nightly room rate was something like $290 and i paid $749.69 upon checking out. I was shocked therefore to find a separate charge to my Credit Card by the Arctic Club Hotel for an additional $658.28!! Calls to the Hotel have not yet received any response, I was merely directed to leave a message for the Hotel Management... I will not contemplate staying at this hotel again until they rectify their error and take steps to prevent its recurrence!####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'conflict']]
l vibe at the Drake I had the pleasure of spending at night at the Drake earlier this month and had a very cool experience...from the kind reception I received upon arriving to the awesome crash pad... only good things to say. Special mention must be made about their beds... honestly the best sleep I have had in a while ...only challenge is leaving it in the morning.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Excellent location This hotel had an excellent location, near Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas. It was also convenient to get to/from the airport with the aerobus stopping at Plaza Catalunya. The rooms were very nicely furnished and quiet and you are greeted with a glass of cava upon arrival. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The only complaint we had was that our room was way too small. From the reviews it seemed that there are larger rooms available, so do ask for those if you can.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Warm memories of Hotel David We had a very nice stay for Christmas 2008 at the Hotel David in Florence, Italy. The staff's hospitality, the warmth of the hotel all decorated for Christmas, the happy hour next to the fireplace, the spacious clean rooms and wonderful freshly baked pastries for breakfast and Christmas Eve, all contributed to a very memorable visit to Florence. I highly recommend the hotel. You will be lucky if, at the height of the season, you manage to book a room in this hotel!I give it a rating of excellent for our overall experience.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Superb Hotel Stayed for 4 nights April 8-12th. Great staff - room was immaculate and more importantly, the bathroom was very clean. Price was extremely reasonable for a hotel 2 blocks from 42nd/Broadway (Times Square) ! Plasma TV was a nice plus. Although no inhouse room-service, there are LOTS of restaurants close by that are open late and will deliver right up to your room. Highly recommended.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Will stay here again when in NYC The location is great, in walking distance to so much. The staff was wonderful and responsive to our needs. The room was so clean and flawless, and the food was great in the restaurant on the main floor. Overall a super experience. One tip, we walked one block east to the Port Authority and caught the New York Airport Service Express Bus for $12 each way to and from La Guardia.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me. I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are very helpful, professional and friendly. The decor is very tasteful, the location is great, the price is very good value, the mini bar was very reasonably priced, the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel. I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Nice Hotel, Great location This hotel was very nice and a great location. Fisherman's Wharf is only a few blocks aways, as well as all the Alcatraz tours and the Trolleys. The rooms were large, and were always clean. The front desk staff were always happy to assist with recommendations for food and booze. It's a great place to stay on you next trip to SF.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted. Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station,bus and tram stops etc. One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution, we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
