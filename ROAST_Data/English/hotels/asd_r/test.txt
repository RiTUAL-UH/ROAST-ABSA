Nice Stayed here for my 30th birthday weekend, booked a standard double, but got upgraded to a deluxe room, very nice indeed. probably the best hotel room i've ever stayed in anywhere in the world. very clean, very quiet, huge bed. front desk staff were very plesent. quite near to Tower hill tube, so travelling to the more lively spots is very easy.recomended.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English. I asked for an ice machine and was almost sent down the street to a gas station because they thought I was asking for an automatic teller machine. The Cuban music at the restaurant next door started at 10 PM or so and didn't quit until after midnight. Not good if you want to catch an early flight. On the good side they did allow us to check in early and the room was clean.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
Excellent Stayed at this little boutique hotel last week... great experience there. The staff was terrific, room was beautifully decorated, and there were no incidental charges. Location in the middle of the Back Bay is convenient to shopping and business needs. Would stay there again anytime.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
"You will not be disapointed" My wife and I stayed at the Menzies Hotel for three nights recently and from the moment we stepped from the cab we were treated as if we were the only guests especially from Andrew who welcomed us. In fact all the staff were excellent right to the cleaning lady who greeted us with a cheery good morning. Menzies your staff are a credit. We'll be back!RegardsDerek Coral Smith####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
ute hotel, but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station, the Accademia and the Duomo, however the noise at night was unbearable! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street, so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel. But if you plan to stay here, make sure you request a room in the back, away from the street (there are many). Otherwise, the reception people were very helpful and my internet-addicted boyfriend loved that there was free internet in the lobby. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, very modern accomodations.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Hotel Casci Hotel Casci is a small family run hotel in Florence, well located and convenient to the Duomo and other sites. The staff was a joy to deal with, no request was too small or too much trouble for them. Their restaurant suggestions were wonderful and their customer service was excellent. This was a our first stay in Florence and Hotel Casci was the perfect location. We spent five nights and highly recommend this hotel to future travelers.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough, but no, they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites. Lastly, in an attempt to kill the termites maybe, the hotel has electrical problems that caused a fire, landing their guests in a 鈥渟helter-like鈥?domain, that was surprisingly better compared to the Chateau Dupre.####[['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative']]
Fabulous, and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel. Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city. Having spent a few hours doing the usual sightseeing, we ended up feeling that we should spend more time in the hotel enjoying its facilities (including a lovely swimming pool) and less time pounding the humid streets. It is very expensive but for a short stay, thoroughly worthwhile.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Decent and great location We used this hotel for a trip to the Nutcracker. I thought it smelled like old chinese food but the the pool, breakfast, and service was really good.

Such a cool place Great hotel, very modern. The room was very comfortable with a great shower (dual shower heads!! loved it). Wonderful view from the 27th floor and totally silent at night.

Best Hotel in San Francisco I am a huge traveler and the Argonaut Hotel was the best I have everbeen too. Not once did I have to open the door myself. Not once did I experience an unhappy employee.

Superb, comfortable stay The hotel was to an excellent standard and very friendly staff. Its an excellent base for sightseeing in London, with The Tower of London only 5 minutes walk away and the Tower Hill tube station on the circle line closer still. We didn't have breakfast in the restaurant but we had drinks in the very swish bar.

Nice Hotel - not sure of the location The Hotel was really very nice - decor was a little weird but the room was very comfortable. The beds are awesome.

Don't believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort. It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated, which it hasn't been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul. The food is mediocure at best, 11 restaurants, only three or four open each night, beach chairs moldy and streached out, dirty beach, mildewed rooms, worn fabrics and furniture in rooms, mini bar not stocked or cold, disagreeable staff, bad service and bugs in the rooms. AA Vacations website states this is a five star property. We would rate it -5 stars. Royal Service is a joke, don't dare pay extra for it, you will be sorry, extra money for nothing, and don't drink the water.####[['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
Simply Fine, Incredible Value Almost everything was just right. Small hotel, front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL, elevators work well, bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily, microwave oven and small 'fridge handy, and supremely knowledgable concierge. Overall, incredible value for NYC.Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad, although going south on 8th is very down-scale (but feels safe--lots of police blending in everywhere--never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians). . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise, even though room faced the street (on 15th floor may have helped--that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling.)####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Great little place in the center of it all We absolutely loved Barcelona and Hotel Rialto was a good base for us. It was a bit smaller than the other hotels that we stayed in the region, but it was well kept and the people were friendly.

Wow, what a great little hotel. My wife and I loved the hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was quiet (exactly what we asked for), the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building. Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco. We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation. This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay (10 years ago) that we decided to stay there this time, neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

BEST OF THE BEST BY FAR Being a frequent traveller for both business and pleasure, I have to say that Hotel De L'Europe has been one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at. The location is excellent, the service is friendly and impecable and the rooms are spotless. It is both an architectural and historical monument and for all of us who are smokers it is still offering not only smoking rooms but also a wonderful smoking lounge with a beautiful view. Both restaurants in the hotel are considered to be of the best in Amsterdam and finally special thanks to the Concierge for all their helpful information.

Go for the regency club--worth extra $$$ My husband and I stayed here and the staff, amenities and hotel made it one of the best vacations we've ever taken. The service was attentive, the rooms and grounds breathtaking. What an amazing view of the ocean to wake up to every morning! Lastly, booking at the Regency Club level meant a room in the top 6 floors with ocean view as well as buffet breakfast every morning AND cocktails and happy hour snacks (like chicken wings, kalua pork, shrimp) every night!####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]

Decent hotel at Fisherman's Wharf This is the second time we've stayed at the Wharf Inn. It's reasonably priced, very close to Fisherman's Wharf, has free parking for one car, and the rooms are OK. Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason  Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from. Great view, though. If you want quiet, you have to put up with the view of the adjacent building.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]

at the monge again Exactly half a year after our first stay in the Hotel Monge we stayed here again for 4 nights. After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed. But no; we enjoyed the time there as much as before. The room was extremely clean, enough space for 3 people, the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food, going for walks (Jardin de plantes!) or simply wathcing people.

Supportive Familiy-like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina. During such a scarey time, the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible....not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit. Our safety was their highest priority, however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days. I do plan to stay at the Hotel Le Cirque again...if only just to thank the staff for being there for us.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona. We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris, so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury.

Pure Quality, if you don't mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week. Had a great room overlooking the church (17th floor). I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal, service was good and the bar area was impressive. This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside, but you do pay for it - (my room rate was of around $600 a night).Overall very happy with the hotel, though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $27.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights' stay at the NY Palace, I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC. My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality, the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick Cathedral on top of those, the use of the lounge was a great boon for us, supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant, friendly and civilized surroundings, the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not-so-friendly city as New York. Also, unlike what was written in a previous preview, we were there with our five yrs old child (having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level) and he was always made to feel at home (I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there). I will definitely return to the Palace.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter, picking the location for it's convenience for the airport for a flight the next day. Rooms are small and functional, bathroom 'unit' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed. Bedding was a little strange, with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers. Staff were efficient, breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time (despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised). It's a decent enough place, even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it's proximity to the runway.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Immaculate, vintage hotel with personable staff--worth the price This impeccably-restored, 1880's era hotel is clean and quiet and wonderfully located in a popular historic district near the waterfront. Our train was delayed and the night desk clerk cheerfully greeted us at 3 AM and even held the door for us. The breakfast, including hard-boiled eggs, various cereals and fresh batter with waffle-maker, was delicious.

Great location, not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size. I reserved directly with the hostel by email (in Spanish) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going, specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square. However, we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal, overlooking the road that was being dug up. Although they said the next day we could move rooms, they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning, which was rather annoying. Overall, it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big, new hotel. When you step in to the lobby of the hotel, it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s.

Stay at the Maxwell if you want the small, boutique feel in a hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay, excellent choice, everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great, rooms little small but never in em only to sleep. Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive, find the cava bar by the port side street, cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down. In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed. We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train, the vaporetto, piazza di Roma and away from San Marco. The room was nice though not large, the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent. The breakfast was varied and tasty.

Wonderful experience I stayed at The Kimberly for only one night on a business trip in April 05. I loved it... The down comforter was amazing!!! They had a great supply of all newspapers available in the lobby for free. I was in a small suite and loved it - tons of space and soo comfortable. I am planning another business trip and while curious about other hotels I am seriously considering The Kimberly again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor, and yet again have not been let down. This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona, the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel, to when you leave. We had a standard room for four nights, and it was just what we needed, I understand that there are better rooms, but this was above what you normally get in this price range. There was plenty of space, the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy, Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas, but when its cold and wet, we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway. All in all a great hotel, and will be stopping again in the future.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Great hotel in the middle of nowhere Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel, modern, fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it. Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views. The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit. Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'negative']]
A Little gem Myself and my partner stayed here for a long weekend from Dublin, the staff wee very helpful and friendly hotel itself is in a lovely location and extremely quiet. Would absolutely recommend for a business or pleasure trip. The only one small drawback was no restaurant, however lots of good cafes in the area.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]
Superb hotel for a superb stay in SF You will not be disappointed with this hotel. The Rooms are spacious, cosy, bright and airy. A nice little touch was of an evening:- dressing gown and chocolates were laid on the bed of an evening. Complimentary hot drinks arrived at the room each morning too. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is also fab!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Horrendous customer service Overall, stay was just okay, but was tainted by management's unwillingness to honor their own quoted/written and confirmed total cost. At check-out, ended up paying additional 10% because of hotel's error in confirmation, even after being told at check-in that they would honor confirmed price. For this alone, would never recommend or stay there again, and we do intend to visit San Juan again. Conceptually, hotel was great architectural idea. Interior build-out, however, was done way too frugally, and there was lots of deferred maintainance in room.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]
Nice hotel with a European feel Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous. The location was great and so was the continental breakfast. The only bad things were that our room had no AC so it was hot and there was a lot of road noise and we used earplugs. All and all it was a nice stay and I would stay again but def not the best ever####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York. We found the hotel very comfortable, with a huge suite including a living area, large bed, decent bathroom and usable kitchen. Compared to similar priced hotels in New York, it earns its above average rating. The location is good for the mid-town attractions, and also has good bus and subway links to SoHo, Greenwich Village, etc. Despite the torrential rain, we enjoyed our stay and still managed to have a fantastic time!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Beautiful Hotel with first-class ammenities and service! We were thrilled with the staff and room at St. James. Close to the best food in New Orleans, and a few blocks away from the French Quarter, we couldn't have been more happy with our long weekend.

We will definitely be back!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great Deal Had a nice stay here. Staff was cordial. Modern decor in the East Tower was fine. Could see that mildew beginning to build up on the bath tiles will contribute to poor maintenance. Would like to recommend Cibo restuarant on 2nd and 41st for a quiet dinner; prix fixed-3 courses seasonal menu, many choices for $30. The new Amish market on 45th is like a mini Whole Foods.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you're driving a car. The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address; according to the GPS in our rented car, the address did not even exist. It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport (if one doesn't take a shuttle), and consequently we almost missed our plane. We arrived late to check-in at the hotel (just before midnight), yet our room STILL was not ready for us. We certainly do not recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Yikes! My family and I stayed here, and I really disliked the hotel. First thing, the room was really small and squeezy. The breakfast shouldn't even be called breakfast, the food looks gross!! Like they've open a can of bake beans and poured the whole thing there.

Loved the Belvedere!! I stayed at the Belvedere for 6 fabulous nights. The room that I stayed in was on the sixth floor and the service that we received was wonderful!

Not bad but could be better, even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations -- really quite nice, but the room itself was fairly spartan. It did have a little sitting area, with two chairs and a table, but the beds were rock hard (you want to ease down on them gently, lest you break a body part). The air conditioning was non-operative during our very warm stay in early-mid May (the screenless window opened, however), the TV remote control did not work, although there was an attempt to repair it, and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced -- and was, with one that smelled somewhat less musty. On the positive side, the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful, the public areas and the rooms were immaculate, the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient, if not particularly appealing. 聽聽####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Nice, Basic Hotel with Great Location This is a basic little place, nothing too flashy. We splurged a little on a superior double room, and had a good-sized room with a balcony overlooking the plaza in front. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room itself was clean and perfectly fine. And, the location is pretty hard to beat - just a block from the Plaza Mayor, close to the bars and restaurants, not far from a Metro stop. I would definitely stay there again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]
great location but thats about it. My husband and I have jusy returned from a four night stay in the Byrant hotel ,we chose it after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor. The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc. I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable, it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]

 bad to be true i stayed 1 night on january 1, first we were assigned a room that had not been cleaned (at 6 in the afternoon) we were given another room but this one had no water, this resolved we had no hot water (we were told by other guests that this problem was 4 days old) we were imformed that this problem was outside the hotel. At 10.:30 we went to the lounge area and the receptionist practicly kiked us away closing the tv and telling us we could not stay there.

Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect. Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one.

Yawn, it's another Hilton It's a Hilton. If you've stayed in one before, you know what you're going to get. Soul-less luxury, well-trained but passionless staff, a feeling of anonymity. If you're paying for yourself (as opposed to business expenses), it's probably not worth the money. Only point where the Hilton Barcelona is above average is the decor, which looks modern and a little more characterful than the average 1970's brown and bronze, chandeliers and marble that most Hiltons seem to display.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
great little hotel My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights art start of july and it was perfect for what we wanted - a real find. Located in quiet area but a quick 15-20 mins walk to San Marco square. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely (far surpassed expectations, Fruit, croissants, cheese, meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker) served in the little courtyard. While it has a 2 star rating, its because it doesn't have things like elevators, a big fancy lobby or iron for guests, but everything else about it was 4 star!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
problems remedied Beautiful hotel, great location. My first room had carpet stains; they moved me to another. It was quite cold and the thermostat had no effect when I raised it.

Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge -but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Divine! This hotel, with its immaculately clean and well-fitted rooms, situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful, safe and secure city. The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful, the service is splendid, however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo, the Campanile and a myriad of terra-cotta rooftops. What an environment to enjoy a truly sumptuous buffet breakfast that really sets you up for the day!####[['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]

Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point, in June 2007. We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic. The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money. Its only a couple of minutes' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station, there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great. The staff were always helpful, plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge.

A happy accident We were put into this hotel by BA when our aircraft developed a mechanical problem and the return flight to London had to be delayed until the next day. In every way the Sheraton Gateway was better than the Holiday Inn at LAX where we spent the first night of our recent holiday. The lobby staff were efficient, the food and service in the restaurant were good and our room was great. We will definitely consider returning to this hotel when we stay at LAX again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
loved the beat - great loaction We stayed here for 2 nights in january 2005. The hotel is superbly placed on the Bourbon, however, the downside to that could be the noise. Our room was on the top floor, but on the corner of Bourbon street and Toulouse.......... therefore the beat from the clubs could be felt. However, the room was so comfortbale, an dthe bed such a joy, indeed i had the nicest sleeps here in 10 days touring the deep south.......####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms, so we decided to try this (based on reviews from TripAdvisor, of course).Upon arriving at the airport (Narita), we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there, right across the street from the hotel. Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo, but that's a 5 minute train ride, with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3~5.About the hotel it is huge, with many options for food and entertainment, I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses. Depending on which tower you stay in (Main Tower was great), the rooms are new, but a bit small, with everything needed in a hotel, including a small fridge (bring your snacks and water).Very clean, nothing to say about that, except that some floors smelled like cigarretts. Internet is paid (about US$10.00) and it is wired, so bring your wireless router (Apple makes a great pocket-sized one).There's a convenience store downstairs, that over charges everything, but when needed it's there.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
Go for the Casitas! The El conquistador Casitas were awesome. The one I stayed in was huge with a full kitchen and ocean view from the balcony.

v nice stayed here for two nights for a wedding. Had a classic room which was small and no view, might have been disappointed if had been staying longer, but for a quick stopover it was fine.

Location, Location, Location -- and a great hotel Just returned from staying three nights at the Chancellor Hotel and have to say that all the Trip Advisor reviews were right on the money. We enjoyed the above-par service, the clean and cozy room (yes, a little tight but workable), the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24/7, and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere -- all at a very reasonable price. Best of all, the hotel is totally non smoking!! Location is perfect, right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop, within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas.

Great affordable place to stay I stayed for two nights last weekend and had a perfectly enjoybale stay. I knew not to expect the Ritz, I did get a clean, comfy bed, a shower and sink with plenty of hot water and good water pressure, and a nice flat screen TV with cable. I was on my own and was out most of the time exploring NYC, but I had a very nice room to come home to. The room was quiet and the lock on the door was very sturdy.

Stylish, friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it. The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera, ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district.

Be wary! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc. However, I found there was some rather foul stains (females staying along do not make marks like that) on the duvet cover, which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc. Really not acceptable in a hotel aiming to be top tier and fairly disgusting. So check your bedsheets before climbing into bed there.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5, 2005. It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10:20 p.m. on the night of Saturday 2nd. It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night. I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me. I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night. Luckily the security latch was on the door and the intruder could not enter.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
A nice, affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona, but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price. Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord, you can't stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona's top sights. Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street. Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room, and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early (9:30ish) in the morning. Otherwise, this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $34 dollars a day. I may have been ok with this had I known, but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website. The manager was quick to show me where the charge was buried in the website rather than to come to some agreement since this was a suprise. Be careful when staying here..... there is a charge for just about everything including to use the gym.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]
Great transit hotel This hotel is a short trip from the airport and a free shuttle was available. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. The staff are attentive and efficient.

Great Small Hotel This is a great small hotel. The beds are very comfortable and it located with a park on one side of the hotel and the beach a few steps from the other side.

I found it to be a very relaxing hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Good location, passive-agressive service The location is terrific - a block from cable car, 2 blocks from Union Square. The room is well decorated, though noisy and on a small side. Upstairs concierge(s) do not say hello, used the speaker phone to talk to the returns department at Macy's (spare me!) my request for missing newspaper was answered with it'll get here. The breakfast area was tastefully decorated with smelly garbage bags the day after Christmas.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Great Location The location of this hotel really couldn't be better - 5 minutes from the Prudential Centre and a metro stop. We stayed here for 2 nights and found the room comfortable and a good size. The room was a little dated but clean. My only complaint would be that the air conditioning is very noisy - you can hear the corridor one all the time. Saying this it certainly didn't keep me awake at night.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
Great!! We staid at the Renaissance for 4 nights during our familly trip to the USA last year and it has been a great experience. Very nice room, nice view over the city, great location, nice restaurant, helpful employees... everything positive except maybe the swimming-pool that was a bit sad looking compared to the general impression given by the hotel.

Good for Marathoners Stayed here for the Marathon weekend, like they said it's not a great neighbourhood but you can't beat the price, parking is free, and the complimentary breakfast is what you need. The free shuttle bus worked well most of the time, we used it to get to the subway. They even made sure it was good to go for us marathon morning. I get the feeling they don't overpay the staff...........####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii. It was definitely impressive, though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare. Still, it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos. My hotel room had what I'd call a partial ocean view, you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view. I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was, even on the 26th floor, I heard even car horn, every screaming baby, every yelling partier on the street, all night long.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Stylish and great staff I stayed at the Hotel Globus in May 2005 as a single female traveller. The room was small but very stylish and spotless. The staff were all fantastic and very friendly.

Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days. The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all, it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem. The main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk. I would certainly use the AB Viladomat if I were to travel to Barcelona again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Enjoyed our stay! We stayed here for a week while our daughter played soccer in the area and found this hotel modern, clean and the staff very helpful. There is a 10 min walk to Central Station, but a tram stops right out side the hotel. We booked through Expedia at around $120/day which I thought was a decent value.

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years. An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff. Great location in Midtown on the East Side, close to restaurants, shopping and an easy walk, cab or subway ride to museums. Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency. My only complaint is the high prices for room service and still a $10 per day charge for high speed internet.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'negative']]
Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest. Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty. Hair in sink and bath was off putting. Best measure of (lack of) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window. We were told someone would clean, then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later. Location only good point.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great hotel, but not so great location The hotel is very modern, with an air of trendiness, the furniture is new and very nice, the bathroom is large, well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny. On the other hand, some things are a little kitchy, like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room (first I thought it's parquet), the breakfast is really poor, the parking a little too expensive (15 euros a day) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying. The hotel is near the train station, but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room. Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls. It takes about 15 minutes to the center.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A'dam. A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station. We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean, attractive and had an great bathroom. The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little (not mid-forties with beard) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room (free tea/coffee/chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free)Only minor points but will be staying there again in September. Try the DutchFlyer website (Stena lines) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing. Great value and a good alternative to flying.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'neutral'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Great hotel The R-C BP is not as high profile as some other NYC hotels. However, it is peaceful, beautiful and a lovely place to stay. The rooms are spacious and the service is great.

Excellent service. We stayed for 5 days during Christmas vacation, 2005. There were 6 of us; 2 seniors, 2 adults and 2 children, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. While the building is older, worn, and was never fancy to begin with; the rooms are big, comfortable, and in a perfect location. The service we received from the entire staff was very friendly and the best customer service any of us had ever experienced.

A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol. True--but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels' and it's a 20 euro cab ride. My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties--a reservation canceled without notice, a free wifi system that was down (a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords), a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks. This hotel is in a suburban business district--it may be very convenient and useful on workdays; my very short stay there, on a Saturday, after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip, was nothing but a series of frustrations.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
loved this hotel loved this classy hotel. lovely lobby, beautiful rooms, pleasant staff. Didn't eat here but located short stroll from upmarket outdoor mall with nice restaurants/cafe. Valet parking good service but pricey. When returned to UK appeared to have been charged the wrong amount to our credit card - tried to sort out by email but are insisting we write to them if we want a copy of our account -not hugely convenient when you live on the other side of the world. hope to get this sorted out as appear to have been significantly overcharged and if we can't sort it would not stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]
>Exactly what we pictured Florence would be! What a beautifully appointed hotel; really a classic! We had an adjoining suite which was absolutely phenomenal, overlooking the Arno.

Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24/7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino, but the rooms themselves are a little tired. That said, they're still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed, except for the absolute lack of patio furniture. Beds were clean and comfy, and the lounge room was roomy. The hotel is starting to show its age though, and the standard prices are several times what they should be. If you want to stay somewhere nice and central (and open around the clock), check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]

Loved everything about this hotel We were looking for a property near LAX, only 7 minutes away and compared to the LAX airport high rises this was a steal. From the welcoming reception, cookies and apples in the lobby, upscale furniture and the cutest open courtyard with bistro sets this hotel does it right. The decor in the room, fluffy towels, above average bathroom accessories and a fridge, bottled water is everything you need. Great location from the pier and no problems at all with noise.

Decent deal, decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean, has a modern Asian feel in the decour, and a decent breakfast to start you on your way. The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge. Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring. This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn't seem to know where it was. The surrounding neighbourhood seems a little run-down but perhaps this is just the old feel of the place.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]

BE Careful Hotel was OK, had problem with room, lack of water (Hot  Cold) also had small ant infestation. Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends, so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools. Also observed staff taking cutlery from one dining table which just finished and placing it on another, not too hygenic, made sure to wash utensils before using. Hotel and staff very pleasant.

A great value right next to the French Quarter I needed an alternate hotel near the Sheraton on Canal, where I was attending a conference. I found the Country Inn  Suites on Magazine Street to be reasonably priced, clean and convenient in location to my conference and to the French Quarter.

Stayed at the Kimberly June 24-27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr, 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6. They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable, pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location, nice doormen, and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we'd stay again -####[['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

bad first impression The Operator who picks up the phone at the general number gave me the wrong fax number. Then when I called back to inquire, the second person was very curt in correcting me, not only was there no apology, she hung up on me as I was still talking without even a 'good bye'. This kind of service attitude is simply not acceptable anywhere, let alone a hotel of this level. If you are going to compete with the rest at this category, make sure your first interface with clients is not this rude and short sighted.####[['service general', 'negative']]
vercharged at check out! The hotel room was fine, rather small but ok. What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate. Of course at check out, they upped my rate even after I reminded them and they assured that I was getting the the lower rate but charged my credit card more. I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate.

Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter. In spite of the rate, we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check-in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids. Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids welcome pack at check-in.

lean and convenient! I stayed here along with a bunch of my girlfriends for my bachelorette party and was very pleased with the service and overall experience at this hotel. We had a one bedroom suite w/ a full kitchen which was great! There are no restaurants on site, but many nearby. You will not be dissapointed if you stay here!####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

great stay We spent one night at this hotel after reading several reviews that were not so good. Worried about the hotel and the neighborhood after a car break in comment, I am happy to say that our stay was wonderful, the surrounding area around the hotel was nice, and the whole stay was great. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. We frequently stay at holiday inns and this was a nice one.####[['hotel general', 'positive']]
Nice location on clarke quay Hotel rooms were clean. Was given a room that could accommodate 2 adults and 3 children which was 2 double beds and a rollaway which was great. The children enjoyed the pool area which was well maintained. The location is great as the MRT is close and lots of restaurants. Restaurants at the hotel are a little pricey but that is normal for Singapore. Stayed 3 nights and had no problems.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Beautiful views Stayed here for 2 days on recent visit to Sydney. The location is excellent, definitely the best part of Sydney for tourists. Loads of really good restaurants and bars, spoilt for choice. The hotel was absolutely fine, good sized room, comfortable and clean. Worth getting a room with a view of the harbour, it does add to the holiday atmosphere.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris, I was concerned to choose well. After reading several reviews on the internet, I selected the Hotel D'Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice. The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was 'at the heart' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme, Louvre, Pompidou Centre, Pantheon etc. The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright, clean, and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate. All in all, the Hotel D'Albe surpassed all our expectations, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit.

Wonderful Stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brentwood Inn. The room was comfortable, clean, and tastefully furnished with great attention to detail. The location was terrific - within walking distance to wonderful restaurants and convenient to the freeway. Free internet access , complimentary breakfast, and bottled water to start the day were great , too. What made our stay truly exceptional was the amazing hospitality offered by the management and staff, who made us feel welcome and cared for during our entire stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
We had our things STOLEN in our room The hotel was aweful, the room door a joke. We had merely arrived and left the hotel room for only one hour to have diner. When we got back, somebody had broken into our room (307) and had stolen our camera, phone, mp3 player, among other things. AVOID THIS HOTEL, even if it is the last available room in the whole of Barcelona.####[['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]
Spacious room A nice, clean hotel located in the downtown area. My room was very spacious with a fridge and microwave. Rate was much lower than other downtown hotels plus the parking is free. A bit of a walk to some of the tourist areas but nothing is too far away.

Misrepresentation We booked three hotel rooms, w/two double beds. We made our reservations six weeks in advance. When we checked in, we were informed that we would not receive what we reserved, because we did not call to confirm. We had the confirmation page that was sent to us. They gave us cots, instead. Blatant misrepresentation!####[['service general', 'negative']]
Great Experience I went to New Orleans with my new Fiance and we stayed at the Doubletree on Canal street and had a great time. The location was awesome, and the hotel was very nice and clean. When we checked in there was a large convention in town and we got upgraded to the Junior Suite which was just incredible, the staff was friendly and professional. I really enjoyed my stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
mfort and convenience at the right price This hotel is primarily a business hotel. It was clean, comfortable and the staff was friendly.

Nice hotel in the heart of Amsterdam This hotel is certainly an institution in Amsterdam. It is very nice inside, but the staff is sometimes a little rude and posh and rooms look pretty old. It is a good choice though. The place where you have breakfast is gourgeous.

We had a great stay at Carabela Bavaro Club Resort We had a wonderful stay. The accomadations were great and the food was great also.

An enjoyable hotel I stayed here recently while attending activites at UCLA. The hotel was well-managed and charming with a clean, soft-modern feel. Regarding location: it would be difficult to do much better as everything is quite close (including the Getty). This hotel, of course, would not be a good pick for someone seeking a high-energy or party atmosphere. It was a relaxing and enjoyable place to spend time in Los Angeles.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Great hotel, good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence, approx 5 mins walk and about 10 -15 mins to main city centre. We were pleasantly surprised by our room, the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was ok - we didn't bother getting up for it after the first morning!There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by. An extra benefit of the hotel is that they have free internet access which is great for that lastminute research or online check inIf you're looking for a hotel that is great value for money, then definitely go for this one!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam. We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer. The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden, which was perfectly nice and quiet. Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East, for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional, something you don't see everywhere. Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well (which we didnt join since we had other plans).Staff, especially porters and concierge, were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans, which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay. All in all, the location can't be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff, Pulitzer gets a thumb up!####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Not what we expected We were to stay at the Riu Palace Macao for five nights, we stayed one. The facilities were old and mold was a definite problem for us. The room was outdated and not up to the four star rating as given on the internet website. The food and service were way below average. The drive to the resort was down right frightening.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Nikko - Clean and convenient. I stayed at the Nikko for 2 days prior to a cruise from San Francisco to Alaska. When I had to change dates at the last minute due to plane problems, the hotel was extremely accommodating. The staff was very helpful and always cheerful during my stay. The hotel is only a block from several great restaurants and a three block walk from Union Square and all the shopping you could want. The price is a bit steep, but the clean and comfortable room with a 42 HDTV made up for it.####[['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive']]

EXCELLENT!!

Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont. We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite, we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money, the rooms are huge. We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river. I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had, however, on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill. A lovely hotel in a great location and if we visit New York again we would not hesitate to stay here.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive']]
ral location Having to go to Manhatten on business, our corporate booked us at this hotel. At the last minute we had to get an additional night and the staff did a great job.

2 stars with 5 stars service what more can i say about this place that has not been said already. It felt like a home away from home not just a hotel. The owners make you feel really welcomed and give you a feeling that you have known them for years. The best part of all was the friendlyness of staff which is so hard to find in some hotels.

A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid: The rate was extremely good (90 euros/night, booked about 2 months in advance); included internet, minibar complimentary; was Exceptionally Clean; Recently renovated; Quiet; Well located (short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction; Mayor Square in the other); very friendly. I was extremely happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you're looking for a smaller hotel that is quiet and well located. Note, it did not have exercise facilities and the on site restaurant was pricey; however, eating options were readily available at a number of restaurants within 1 to 3 minute walk.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative']]

The hotel was probally cool a few years ago but is now looking old and tired. Staff are helpful but no room service or help with your bags.

Not at all what is used to be This once was a nice hotel which has gone for the cheapercrowd, tatoo people, Mom Dad 3 kids in a room type deal + events. Way too small to handle both conferences and wedding events on the same day along with family outings. This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences, cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd, and weddings anyday of the week which means: bottom line the facilities are not available 24/7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard. What was once a $400 night hotel for the business, elite traveler is now a $49-79night cheap 4 star; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline, this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed. Very crowded, very low class. We had business guests with written reservations well in advance, two were bumped out of the hotel; we were treated rudely, pulled our corporate account.####[['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september. Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF, we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel. It presents itself as a cute boutique hotel which is how it looks on the website, however the reality is not. Room was tiny, deco was average, cleaning was it is minimum levels.

Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff are excellent.

Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January, 2006. We arrived a full 39 hours late, due to snow in Tokyo, but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren't there. They even let us stay for an extra night, at the same very low rate. The hotel was great; lots of space, clean, very central to everything in Waikiki, but very quiet too. Will definitely stay there again !####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Generic Motor Hotel Two Holiday Inn's, back-to-back: This one and the H.I. Express Seattle. Very close to the space needle and a couple of blocks to the free bus zone going downtown. Generic rooms with microwave and mini-fridge. Newer properties, very clean and well equipted. Parking was $4.50 a day. This place is clean and well located to Seattle Center and within decent proximity to downtown.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]
small small small This is a hotel where you can stay if you never have been to the city before and plan on getting up and going from morning till night. If not, don't attempt it. Dont get me wrong the decor was nice and the hotel was clean but you have to walk sideways between the walls and the bed. We ended up leaving and going to the Crown Plaza where I know the rooms are nice sized.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Tiny room with many ants The room wasn't available to check-in until late afternoon. Once in the tiny room we discovered it was full of ants. I would estimate there were over 20 to 30 ants on the floor at one time. Telling the front desk attendant about the ants, she seem unconcerned and was suprised this was an issue. Having no other rooms we checked-out and were not charged.####[['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict']]
Beautiful and Friendly This is the place to stay! The guest house is gorgeous, in the Spanish style (white-walled with red tile roofing) and with little courtyards and private spaces. One short block from the beach too! The staff was super-friendly, especially the younger employees; they took a personal interest in our stay and answered all our questions about the culture, places to go, etc.####[['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Absolutely terrible! We stayed here in August 2006 and this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at. The rooms, furniture and appliances were so old that we thought we were in a motel off of a small highway. The food was so-so but the restaurant service was absolutely terrible. We were absolutely unimpressed!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Great location My husband and i have just spent three nights in this hotel. It is ideally situated to see all the main sights as it is right across the street from the train station and under ground, which I must say we found to be brilliant as they all seem to arrive on time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. The staff are friendly and the concierge are excellent for information about the best way to get to sights. All in all an excellent trip and I would have no hesitation on recommending this hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive']]

average at best This hotel has a good location, but not a lot else, it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room, including giving us the key to an occupied room, and keys that did not work. We were then allegedly upgraded, from what I cannot imagine, the room was tiny, and not air conditioned. The continental breakfast was a complete farce, a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom, which had then to be carried back to the bedroom, where there was no where to eat but on the bed. The staff apart from the initial difficulties were pleasant and helpfull, and the hotel seemed clean.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive']]
absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews, we were a bit weary about this hotel. It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop. What valuables we did have (passports, cash etc) was stored in the reception safe and always available. Staff were friendly enough, but the main attraction is this hotel's location right on the bustling las ramblas. If it's a quiet place you're after don't book here, but if it's a clean budget hotel right in the heart of things, we would absolutely recommend it.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
ideal location excellent location, not knowing the city, we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area, pier 39 , the deals, alcatraz. The hotel was very plush inside, staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile. Our room was fantatic, modern clean and decorated to a very high standard. The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn't get to appreciate the facilities. Would suggest this hotel used if time to be spent relaxing within the hotel, if a hotel needed to use as a base for sightseeing then maybe this one is a little too expensive.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Good FQ option We had a very nice night at the Monteleone. The location is excellent and the room was clean and quiet. We did not have a view but we slept like rocks. I prefer a quiet room over one with a window on the French Quarter street noise.

Nice hotel, uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance. It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small, considering it is in Florida. The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy; I am sure it will improve in the next few years. Overall a good hotel for business meetings but not for vacationers.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative']]
Disappointing and watch the final bill I've stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated (given the price) I've returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it. I wouldn't return to The Clift; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge/front door staff are all good but that's about it. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen (and I had a loft suite) - and for the price other hotels offer more (no flat screen TV, ineffective air con). What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US$185 for late checkout without any notification (I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11.00am). E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location, that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar, and the rudness of the people at the front desk. Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise, and when you only need five minutes to get to any place, you forget the rudness of the front desk staff. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was ok, and remember this, if is clean and has a great location, the restis not important. Will definitely come back here. They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm, with very good food.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
Excellent all the way around We always stay at Embassy Suites when we can and this one keeps with the tradition and quality that you come to expect. The concierge and all of the staff were always friendly and helpful. We tried to upgrade to a full ocean view and couldn't but the partial view was still wonderful. You can never miss at Embassy with the full made to order breakfast and daily managers reception. Highly reccomend and was excellent all around.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
IDEAL for large groups. Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30's and 40's. Found it to be a good quality ,well run, clean hotel. Staff were all very curteous and welcoming (even when returning from nights out at 5.30AM) and rooms were clean and adequate. Didn't sample the food - plenty of cafes, restaurants and bars within 50 yards. Steps to (excellent) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport (get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T-10 ticket that allows 10 journeys).Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro's a day is a bit stiff.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Gem in a Non-Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed. I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don't know about this place. We got great service, a great view, a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels (e.g., the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical/health activities). I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them. I can see why -- nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes (mostly) of tourists. I want to stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

good location, but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october. The price was reasonable, however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week. We wanted 2 singles, but for 2 nights they were 'unavailable' so we were moved around rooms with double beds. On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double, but we were unable to swap with them. Apart from the trouble with the rooms, the location was fantastic, only a quick walk to union square and the staff were polite and helpful.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

Over rated We just came back from a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room ( # 6 ) is very small and obviously the web site photos are very unrealistic.

Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel. When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip, we got a cancellation number. A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.####[['service general', 'negative']]
Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our room was a really good size and very comfortable. Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee, it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10:30am. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs, bacon, toast etc. We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week (departed 16/8/06). The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling. We realised that the breakfast charges of 330,000 R for breakfast for two was way over the top, and started visiting outside the resort. Everything works, it鈥檚 all nice, but it feels like nobody鈥檚 there, and its not fun.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative']]
Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you'd go to if you want a really upscale, romantic place to stay. BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam. It's a two minute walk to the Dam Square, 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam. The hotel is clean and quiet an comfortable, but I would say the key selling point is the fact that it is so well located.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]

The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean, spacious modern rooms. The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city.

Awful hotel I spent one night only, fortunately, in this hotel. Upon arrival we had to pay cash before entering the room, theN we found on one bed , dirty linen that had to be changed. The room lacked maintenance on the furniture and in the bathrrom nothing was repared. In the morning breakfast was very poor and when i asked forchocolate for my child they did not have any. And to finish we asked to leave the luggage for the day and it was kept outside in a courtyard getting wet because of the rain.

decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam, but it wasn't too far from it. It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night. It was clean and comfortable, but nothing spectacular. There were a few burn marks, probably from smokers, but I guess that's to be expected in Amsterdam. The free breakfast was decent, and at least it was free, a rarity in Europe.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'neutral'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of. Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation, the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel, which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare. We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn't get much satisfaction. I believe if you pay a high price for a hotel you are entitled to the service. We will not be going back there.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

agree with "do not stay here" This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn't give it two. A hint to future guests: if you have a problem, it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations. They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it. They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns.

The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were. Entertainement was poor, nothing really jumped out to us and as an English family our son was bored to death as her had nothing to do, and most of the other guests were none english a lot of spanish, french usa.the beach and pool areas are fantastic no complaints there, like a lot of other people we had upset stomachs and my son was ill in bed on arriving home for 2 days Dont know were the problem lies as we were always careful with what we ate and drank.would be fine for a week but 2 weeks confined in one place is not for m####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
good hotel, good location, great staff Charming hotel , very clean, close to everything. Very friendly and helpful staff, who were happy to assist with everything, including our last minute request to stay additional two nights, and to send an international fax for us (they did it free of charge).Hotel is easy to walk to from the train station, no point getting a taxi. Good internet, cheap. Very good breakfasts. Lots of small extra rooms (reading room, etc ).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city. It is a bit expensive but if you take into consideration that you get a good breakfast included, and free transportation on all the S bahns, U bahns and busses, it is worth it. You just go downstairs and the train station and the S Bahn is just down there. Also a mall with all kinds of restaurants and shops.####[['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive']]

peace in a great location We spent two nights here last weekend and it lived up to all of this site's positive reviews. The bed and room were small but wonderful and so quiet.

we like the St Francis This is a lovely hotel with a sense ot charm and history. However it is a bit dated in places, (corridors and rooms), however it is really in a great location, right overlooking Union Square, right in the midst of it all, and close to shops, restaurants etc. we were on our honey moon so they gave us a special room which was really quite big and nicely furnished. the champagne mojitos in the bar were pretty excellent too.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
above average international blah hotel This is a big, beige international hotel. That said, it's quite good at it. It's in a really terrific location, right on the river and a very short walk to heaps of dining, entertainment and the metro. The rooms are like rooms are, but pristine and with most facilities. It's got a great pool and a gym I didn't try, and breakfast is included in the tariff I believe.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Would Stay There Again and Again I have been to Amsterdam a half-dozen times in the last few years, and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that. The location is nearly unbeatable. The view from canal-side rooms is unbeatable. The rooms are charming, spotless and spacious. The price was right. I have paid a lot more for standard Amsterdam charmless fare, but I won't again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Poor Guest Services Operator Stayed at hotel for post-operation recovery. Telephone did not work in the room. Operator wrongly misdirected friends family as well as doctor that I did not want to receive any phone calls. Front desk operator further aggravated the situation by pre-screening calls by asking callers for the identification and relation to the guest. Would not recommend other patients of the nearby hospital to stay at this hotel, not friendly service towards guest's callers.####[['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative']]
Great place to stay A very clean hotel and good value for money. Our room was on the small side with a view of the back laneway, however it was very clean and quiet. The TV was almost on the ceiling, but that didn't bother us. The staff were very friendly and the location superb. I'd stay again but ask for a larger room if staying more than 1 night.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive, superb location very close to station, air-conditioned rooms, lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax, a 10% tax that everyone has to pay. Although it's possible for non-Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $300, that doesn't apply to services. You've got a great hotel guys, worth $165 per night of anyone's money, so why not be honest about your prices?####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Great location, excellent value We stayed 3 nights in the Royal Magda for during half term and booked a double and a large double with sofa bed for our 3 children (415 and 416). Our stay was excellent value for a mid-priced three star hotel. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the location was very convenient. The rooms were small but adequate and the breakfast room was a bit of a squash but otherwise no complaints. We would definitely recommend.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Fabulous top class hotel We stayed for 3 nights here, in between visiting Kuala Lumpur then Pengang ~ without a shadow of a doubt this was the best part of the trip. We could not fault the hotel, the location was great, the staff superb and the rooms absolutely wonderful, very spacious and the most wonderful bathrooms. I was suprised about other reviews commenting on the pool, we were delighted with the pool and the wonderful towels provided, especially as this is a City hotel. We will stay here again when we next visit this vibrant beautiful city.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities quality', 'positive']]

Great for our short break Nice place at a really decent price for proper Hong Kong hotel (we booked through a thai website, great deal). It is not in centre of town but is 2 seconds from a tube line or you can do what we did every day for fun and get the trams that run all the way into the city.

great hotel Just returned from this hotel after spending 4 nights. took our friends, who had never been to berlin before. the hotel was perfectly situated on the KuDamm. Spotless rooms and a very good size. breakfast room on 6th floor with fab views of the main shopping street, with plenty of choice for even the most picky eater. very friendly staff in a small foyer/reception with a small bar in the corner for those late night nightcaps. would definately reccommend this hotel and will be going back ourselves next year.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
zy This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place).I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.####[['hotel design_features', 'conflict'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative']]
Great for our family of 5 Great hotel for family! We spent four nights at the Ilikai with our 3 sons, ages 15, 12 and 8. It was away from the hustle and bustle of the main part of Waikiki Beach, but right next door the the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We had an ocean view room with 2 dbls, 1 sofabed and kitchette.

Great hotel Just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. The room was lovely, really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries, a well-stocked mini bar and a pillow menu, so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of, with big comfy leather sofas, a huge TV and free tea, coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday-Thursday between 6pm and 7pm! The staff were also great, really friendly and helpful. The location is good, between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away, and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues. I would stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

A Very Special Place I had done a lot of research into hotels in Venice and with the help of the reviews on tripadvisor I booked my girlfriend and I into the Hotel Al Ponte. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and can honestly say that it was one of the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The rooms were extremely clean and very comfortable. The hosts we helpful and attentive at all times without being pushy!!!The location of this hotel is brilliant, close to everything yet far enough away to enjoy a walk through the streets of Venice to the main sights.

Good Budget Hotel... Key Word = Budget Monte Carlo is clean, fairly comfortable (very firm beds) and best of all, well located. Have no qualms about booking this hotel if you're travelling on a budget (I believe we paid around $50 a night for a double room w/ no WC in high season). However, consider skipping breakfast- for 7 Euro, you could do better at a corner bakery.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

My husband and I stayed for three nights and on each night we asked to upgrade however the hotel is apparantly always full so be prepared and the book the room type you want early. The hotel's rates are very reasonable which is why we booked and I assume why the hotel would be in such high demand.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

Great hotel It was so beautiful there, and we would love to go back!! The thing is you cant really leave the resort, at least we didnt, as its kind of dangerous too. You have to stay within your resort. The good thing is if you stay at the Riu, there are 4 other Riu resorts you have access too!, so you can check out the others.

l location I stayed a couple of days in NYC on my way home from the West Coast. I picked the Sofitel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and the Internet rates they were offering. I really enjoyed the location, the hotel is great (nice lobby, stylish rooms, good concierge service, etc). The only thing I didn't like (while staying at the 12th floor) is the view - there was none - only a back street. If you can find a good rate, I can only recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]

isy, noisy There was construction going on just outside my window and it was very noisy. When I checked out, the staff accused me of trying to skimp on minibar purchases.

Big rooms, near the night-life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise. Very well-located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well-decorated. Service is good-enough and the stairs (there's no elevator) can be scary if you have big suitcases. Very good deal, specially for young couples. It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around, but nothing that bothers too much.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]

An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us. It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel, where peace and tranquillity was the order. The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent. Some may consider the rooms on the small side, but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair, you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer.

Very average indeed The room was large and comfortable, but I was not otherwise terribly impressed with this place.

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia. The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted, but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations. Not the best news for our daughters, who were eager to swim after the flight! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door, but whilst better than nothing, this was not terribly convenient. The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd, but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'conflict']]

Pleasantly surprised! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate, so I wasn't expecting much. The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano, or later in the night, the jazz quartet. My room was very large, my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old (it took a long time for the hot water). Otherwise this place is a gem and a nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter chains.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
#4 Hotel in Los Angeles??? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights. Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms. Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like. The carpeting was stained, there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub. Granted the location is good, however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities cleanliness', 'negative']]

Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed!!We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great. For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy. The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk.

really disappointed I can not believe this hotel has such rating stay away from it, I think it deserve one star the most. The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it, they charge you for compelementry coffee, and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port. Bottom line very expensive for the service for the same money you can get a real 5 star hotel. Trust me stay away.

One of the finest hotels in the world This may be the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We stayed in the Executive House Zen which is very pricey, but well worth it if you like unbelievable service. The rooms are modern and roomy by Japanese standards. This is a standout for business travelers or vacationers for whom the money is not the cheif concern.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
great location This hotel is in a fantastic location, close to the shops, bus station and duomo. The staff are friendly. The rooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms are modern and well equipped. I would recommend this hotel and will be returning to it next time I go to Florence. As stated previously, the breakfast is not amazing but it is adaquate!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Lovely boutique hotel The Hotel Ares Eiffel was renovated a few months ago and has been done very tastefully. Some of the previous reviewer photos are a bit old and not at all representative of the current state. The room we stayed in (executive) was very nice. It's reasonably expensive but bearing in mind the location and that this is Paris, probably about right. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a very nice boutique hotel!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'neutral'], ['service general', 'positive']]
sistent, nice bar We have a corporate rate at the JW Marriott and I look forward to staying there again. The bar is very cute and doesn't feel too much like a hotel bar. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are nice. Absolutely NO issues. The gym is slightly larger than a normal Marriott gym (about 2 guest rooms large rather than 1)####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
ral Plaza, not really. Don't be mislead by the addrerss, it is not central to anywhere and 20 mins at least to get anywhere in town. Hotel itself very nice, modern, good food very nice staff. Heating and lighting could be better. Took tours by Grayline, excellent.####[['location general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Restaurant Recs The Ritz is a terrific hotel but their restaurant recommendations need updating. The consierge sent me to a so-so Sushi place called San Raku and then to an awful Chinese place called Oriental Pearl. In a city of thousands of Japanese and Chinese restaurants I think the Ritz could do better.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Recommended by a fussy pair! My friend and I stayed in Room 273 and found it to be clean and comfortable. Sheets and towels changed daily, room was sufficient size with tea making facilities replenished each day, breakfast was simple but very edible and the staff, although we didn't require much, were helpful! Internet access available, storage for baggage, definately would stay here again and worth the money. Located on a quiet street beside Vondelpark, PC Hoovestraat, with great shopping and trams.

Good location, needs renovated The website inaccurately reported the hotel had been renovated. Carpets were worn, common areas not clean and the furnishings dated.

Great Hotel Great hotel for families, with main bedroom and seperate sitting room for kids with foldout bed. Kitchenette useful.

Total incompetence The staff at this hotel all of the way up the manager are totally, totally incompetent, definitely stay away! My initial reservation was totally botched by someone who sounded like a teenager answering the phones. Then when I called to cancel my reservation I discovered that the mistake had never been fixed. Even worse yet, despite cancelling, my credit card was still billed and after 6 calls and several e-mails to the hotel, including Leah the manager I was never responded to!! I have never never had an experience like this at any hotel in my life!####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]

Wonderful visit at The Adler Cavalieri Wonderful overnight experience! The room was spotless. The staff was so helpful, providing excellent directions and even an umbrella!I highly recommend - the hotel is close to the train station as well as within walking distance of many of the interesting sights.

We'll stay at the Adler Cavalieri again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
worth the price! We stayed at the Ritz Millenia for 5 days in Sep 06. Their staff were super friendly - and made all the arrangements we asked for. The location is perfect for evening walks by the river, with all the restaurants nearby. The bathroom was the highlight of the accomodations - we had the river view which was spectacular. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone!One downside: the room service breakfast options are limited, you are better off walking to a cafe nearby.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

great value - in der mitte just returned from a two night stay at the mercure - a very unpromising facade, but don't let that put you off! We payed around 70 euro a night - and i was pleasently surprised. We had an enormous room, big comfy kingsize bed and a great shower. Couldn't ask for anymore really, about a 20 minute stroll to mitte and hackescher markt.

Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic, the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms. It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin (its very cheap, efficient and easy to navigate) but the area was no problem - I guess it's worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are. I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price, venue and facilities (breakfast, spa, small bar, minibar, bikes available and outside seating). Stay here!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
A great base to explore SF Stayed here for 3 days while exploring SF for the first time - what a great place! Very central to Union Square and transport links, I was very pleased with my find as we were so central!Good bed in average sized room, very large bathroom, breakfast supplied in lobby in the morning is the average American continental danish and coffee. Can really recommend this place if you are keen to be central and want to spend your time looking at the sites rather than trecking back to a hotel on the other side of the city####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral']]
Great Hotel Have just returned from a weekend away march 4 - 7th. Our room was on the 37th floor and we had great views of the Empire State building and the river. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. Location is excellent and only a few minutes from the heart of Time Square.

Awesome time Just returned from my vacation and I had a fantastic time. The weather was really nice and the grounds where immaculate. The Dominicains are some of the friendliest people you could ever meet. If someone has already planned their trip to the Palladium and going there shortly and would like some tips or advice on where to go and which restaurants are the best, send me an email and I would be happy to help.

Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6-10 June 2008 for 4 nights. We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge/freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there. Could not fault it at all. Hotel is in a great location, plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station. I think this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when doing a city break. Would definately recommend it.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Stylish and Sophisticated Soho Hotel was very modern and stylish. The hotel was clean and maintained to a very high standard.

Delightful and Romantic!! We stayed at this hotel with friends. We decided to spend about $50 more per night, but our room was spectacular, while theirs was average or below. Still, even they were satisfied with the stay because they saved money and the location was ideal for our tastes. Really a wonderful hotel, but don't spare the expense. It's worth every penny!!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
To Much Attitude and Bad Customer Service I stay at this hotel regularly for business. The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time.

Great Deal! Got a great deal at the Marinna Inn. The location was nice, the hotel clean, friendly and problem free.

wonderful experience I love Bali very much, together with my husband and other couples, we always stayed in five star hotel. This time we want to spend in private villas instead. And we find Aston bhavana, perfecly located in prime area in Seminyak. we are very happy with this decision. The design is so cozy and the villas is so spacious, the ambience is so fresh, we could relax in our private pool, and having a chef cooked in our villas, the service is absolutely high end, we feel so special.

Great location I stayed in this hotel in jan 2007 for three nights, you could not wish for a better location, everything is within reasonable walking distance and for those who don't like to walk there is a tram stop directly outside the hotel. my room was small but clean with tv and tea + coffee making facilities and a safe big enough for a laptop. The bathroom was fine with a good shower. I did not eat in the restaurant as their is plenty of choice in amsterdam, the bar is expensive but a pleasant enough place to meet up or finnish the night.

Excellent Choice for Business Traveler, Tourists A very nice hotel. Good amenities (ice tea and snacks in the afternoon, free breakfast in the morning, coffemaker, microwave, fridge in room). If you are a jogger, this is an excellent location - run down St. Charles for a few miles in the former trolley tracks or drive a few blocks to Audubon Park and run the loop there. Close to nice restaurants and a large Whole Foods on Magazine Street. A great value too. I will definitely stay here again.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
Great hotel, great service, great location! My family of four, including two teenage boys stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is excellent, the rooms, although fairly small, were certainly big enough for the four of us and were well maintained and very nicely decorated. We received very good service and would definitely stay there again if we return to Boston. Everyone, including the desk clerk, concierge, door man, and housekeeping staff were friendly as well as helpful. I have no complaints and would highly recommend the Boston Park Plaza.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]

Great Customer Service... Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to 'overbooking'. This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night.

WE LOVED IT. Berlin was the start of our Europe trip and the Westin was a great start to our holiday. Without doubt when in Berlin we will try to stay here again. The location is perfect (a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag),the heavenly beds are heavenly, the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations.

PB We had a Fabulous time!! We brought our 2 small children with us and the hotel staff was very accomadating. The rooms were gorgeous with all the amenities.

Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles (check in delayed by half an hour, water pressure) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service. Interiors are very well designed, minimal being the key word. I'd go back there as the location is perfect, we walked everywhere and didn't need to take the tube at all! One highlight: the breakfast! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices, cooked brekfast with tortillas, eggs, bacon, etc is definitely worth it!####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive']]
Recent Upgrade I stay at this hotel regularly for business and pleasure. It is in a great location, right next to Chinatown, across the road from the Sydney Entertainment Centre and a short walk from Darling Harbour.

While it is not in the most glamorous part of the city it is well worth a visit.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Recommended, but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online. I'm sure this hotel is fine for vacationers: the rooms are ok (especially the kitchenettes), the location is pretty good, and the staff are helpful. However, I don't recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer. The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm, and the wireless internet mostly non-existent (at least while I was staying). It just isn't worth it.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]

great everything Booked this hotel through Last Minute.com when my other hotel booking was in euros and needed a better deal. This hotel was first class, on arrival at reception got served immediately given all the info I needed with maps and details of trips and buses. room was very clean, the bed was huge, the buffet breakfast was brilliant and catered for every taste. The hotel was a 5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port, with regular buses and a metro stop outside.

really liked it We stayed in December just for 1 night, but I liked the location, the room (great bed) and the staff. The restaurant was very good. It is joined by the skyway to 2 rather pricey malls, but is was good not to have to go outside to shop. Legal Seafood is in the mall, Yummy!

Excellent accomodations. Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace. It is a lovely hotel deserving of it's 5 star rating. The employees were very helpful, very accomodating. Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money, asking about areas we wanted to visit, ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants, even getting a massage.

We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel. The staff at the hotel were simply superb; Mendrin, Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24/7! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front, with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants. Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options, imported spirits, late check out and free laundry service!Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don't forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities quality', 'positive']]
The views are just to die for!!! Stayed here for a long week-end, November 4th - 8th, in Room 308 and the views from that room were marvellous, the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay and the Eiffel Tower and we overlooked the Tuilleries, these views were even better at night when Paris was lit-up!!! The room was comfortable, fantastic bathroom - huge and the bed was one of the most comfy that I have slept in anywhere in the world and the hotel is in a wonderful location.

Never stay here! Whew, this place was bad. The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn't let my kids in it, the whole place smelled, and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments. I was literally scared of this place, and when I reported it to the desk, they just said they couldn't stop the calls because they were coming from within the building.

Over rated For the price you pay, make sure you get one of the better rooms. When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom... the restaurant is pretty cool.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['facilities general', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict']]
