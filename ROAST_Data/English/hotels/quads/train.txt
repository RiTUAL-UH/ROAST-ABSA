Excellent location and view ! I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel ' s location , new decorum view from our 21st level room and a complementary breakfast in the early morning before our tour . I haven ' t visited Waikiki Beach in decades and this overnight was a great way to end our week in Hawaii .

Fantastic location We stayed here for one night on the 3rd leg of our Honeymoon and it was fantastic , we had a suite with a little kitchen and a lounge and a large bedroom .

Great location and spacious room Can ' t argue with the location ( short walk to Universal Studios , short drive to Hollywood and downtown ) , or the room which was massive and comfortable with a great bathroom . Price for room was pretty good and they were able to extend our stay by a day ( you will need time to explore LA ) . nly downside were the exorbitant charges for even short local phone calls and internet access . Everyone knows hotels love to charge for any extras , but their prices were outragous and we simply couldn ' t avoid them due to crcumstances . Breakfast was nice and reasonably priced ( extra to cost of room ) verall , pretty good , just a shame they feel they have to rip off tourists who need to make urgent calls .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spacious'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'massive'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['bathroom', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great'], ['Price for room', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'pretty good'], ['local phone calls and internet access', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'exorbitant charges'], ['prices', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'outragous'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'nice'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'reasonably priced'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'pretty good']]

Desk service is condescending , except for the sheets rooms are really not well - maintained , carpet is badly stained , and everything is worn - out . Good but noisy location with thin walls . Downstairs breakfast restaurant looks mediocre and expensive , though the night club looks intrguing . Would stay again only if stuck . ip : Unless the season is very busy , you can probably get very deep discount coupons at Visitor Center , so don ' t reserve ahead .####[['downtown', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'nothing decent'], ['clientele', 'service general', 'negative', 'too young and / or drunk to know any better'], ['Desk service', 'service general', 'negative', 'condescending'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'really not well - maintained , carpet is badly stained'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'everything is worn - out'], ['location', 'location general', 'neutral', 'Good but noisy'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'mediocre'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'expensive'], ['night club', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'looks intrguing'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Would stay again only if stuck']]
A Great Base of Operations for Uptown Manhattan I was a bit concerned about staying at the Marquis right up until the moment we checked in . ur stay could not have been any better .

Great amenities for the price If you want a first class or corporate hotel in a nondescript cityscape , then stay away from the Perak , instead book at one of the glass and concrete boxes on Orchard Road . he Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore . For around $ 70USD per night you get a clean ( albiet small ) room , with basic but nice appointments ( Cable TV , A / C , DVD , free wireless internet , etc ) , a good location in vibrant Little India , and basic but tasty buffet breakfast . I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up . But the cheapest rooms at the Perak have a skylight rather than a window and are much quieter if noise is an issu####[['price', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Great amenities'], ['Perak', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great value for the money'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'albiet small'], ['room', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'basic but nice appointments'], ['Perak', 'location general', 'positive', 'good location'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'basic but tasty'], ['Perak', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'much quieter'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'neutral', 'bit of street noise'], ['rooms', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'cheapest']]

problems in paradise I was travelling on a family gathering in Miami , and my family booked at this hotel previously . I arrived at 2230 on a Thursday and Friday morning enjoyed the breakfast they offered , subsequently we left the hotel around 1430 on Friday and returned at 1600 , on return luggage from our room had been stolen . My major concern was the way in which the hotel handled this , the first question they asked was should we call the police ? I also noted that on return at least 3 room doors were opened by housekeeping and the rooms unprotected by employees , thus violating their own policy - to get into this hotel you have to go through a gate into a secured compound . My warning is this : the hotel accomodations are nice and pleasant , be very careful about your possessions and use the safe !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'problems in paradise'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'enjoyed'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'luggage from our room had been stolen'], ['housekeeping', 'service general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['hotel accomodations', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'nice and pleasant'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'be very careful about your possessions']]

Worthy of the Praise All we can do is echo the praise that other reviewers have bestowed upon this wonderful oasis . What an endearing spot !

Superb breakfast view k , I ' m a little biased because Berlin in the snow in mid - February is inspiring , but this was a superbly located hotel , with great facilities and very helpful staff ( whose English is far better than mein Deutsche ) . My girlfriend pointed out that were it slightly further up the Ku ' damm , by only about 75 metres , it would be more expensive to reflect the slight - change in area , so it really is a bargain . I ' ve never been in a hotel where for such little outlay you have a MASSIVE bath in a marble bathroom , set in a large , well laid - out clean and comfortable room . My top tips would be to have the ( very ample buffet ) breakfast there , whilst enjoying the view from the 6th floor - fruhstuck even runs until 10 , so you can still have a bit of a lie - in ; and to get a City / Welcome card , as the hotel is very close to stations for all the forms of transport ( except trams , being located in the West ) , thereby utilising its much raved about location . We would eagerly use it again .####[['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'Superb'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'superbly located'], ['hotel', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'great facilities'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'bargain'], ['bath', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'MASSIVE'], ['bath', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'marble bathroom'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'well laid - out clean'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'very ample'], ['hotel', 'service general', 'positive', 'very close to stations'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'would eagerly use it again']]

Lovely My friends and I stayed here for four nights over the St Patricks day period . Our rooms were on the 36th floor , really nice rooms , very clean and modern , maid service every day . The only thing I would fault would be , some of the reception staff are quite rude , and keep an eye on your bill with the bar staff , if they are serving at your table , keep tabs of what you had as they do seem to try to add drinks on that you haven ' t had , or imply you haven ' t paid !

Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor , and all the previous positive reviews are spot on . The Europa doesn ' t seem to appear in any guidebooks , and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising , but once you arrive in the hotel , Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts . The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished , and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes ' walk from the Duomo .

Great hotel , shame about the price increase ! We enjoyed a fantastic Mother - Daughter trip to Paris in August and were very impressed by the quality / cost ratio of Regent ' s Garden Hotel . We got a really nice , recently refurbished twin room for only 99 Euro ( booked direct on the hotels website ) . However , rather large negative : A few weeks later , having been so impressed by the hotel that I was planning a second trip back there to stay with my husband , I was told by the hotel that it had just been upgraded from a 3 * to a 4 * hotel and that subsequently the price has increased from 99 Euros for a Classic room to 169 Euros ! A huge increase which dramatically changes the ' value for money ' aspect of the hotel . While I would agree that an increase was warranted based on the refurbishment , it does not warrant a 70 Euro increase and it ' s a real shame as it puts a nice little hotel in the unaffordable category for a lot of people who would previously have stayed here ( a comment I made to the hotel ) .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'price increase'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'recently refurbished'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'impressed'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'unaffordable category']]

Seriously lacking This particular Four Seasons property was absolutely forgettable . From the moment we pulled up , the service was way below expectation . . . . sitting in the car with the luggage for several minutes ( no bellhop ) and having to re - circle the property to get help with the bags , to the missed wake - up call , to waiting for 45 minutes for a coctail server to approach our table in the lounge . . . everything seemed to be a bit off .

The owners and staff are extremely accomodating , offering good advice to restaurants ( their recommendation of Za Za ' s Tratorria was so good we went back our last night ) , tours and anything else you need to know .

Mixed review We celebrated my husband ' s 60th birthday and I had booked 4 rooms . We had problems with the final billing for 3 of those bills . I received an internet rate of $ 64 a night , but the bill indicated $ 127 and we were charged for a valet service that we did not have for one room . Check your billing statement .

Great location ; Comfortable hotel - shame about the building We picked the Radisson by chance out of a very long list of Boston hotels . Despite being the ugliest building in Boston it is a comfortable hotel whose location is fantastic for most of the central Boston attractions .

Good hotel , problem with a burger I stayed here after a Red River Shootout , and it was good . The room was cozy and it was easy to access .

11 days in HK We stayed at the South Pacific Hotel from 07 / 03 / 2006 - 16 / 03 / 2006 and found our stay to be most enjoyable . The hotel is quite basic , with a bar fridge and kettle , very clean and well located in Wanchai , with shops ( two good bakeries nearby ) and Times Square an easy walk , transport is very close . The concierge , the doorman and the cleaning staff were very friendly and attentive . The twin bed room was more spacious than the double room , the beds are easy enough to push together .

Good value , Good location Booked a two night stay including breakfast both days and evening meal on first night for 拢179 . Evening meal was absolutely awful , supposedly nouveau cuisine but simply an excuse to serve minute portions of tasteless food . However everything else was great and in contrast to the evening meal , the buffet breakfast was fantastic . Room very nicely decorated , 11th floor had great panoramic view from Greenwich to Crystal Palace . The location is also good just yards from South Quay DLR station . From here you can get into central London quickly .####[['value', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Good'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['value', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'including breakfast'], ['Evening meal', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'absolutely awful'], ['Evening meal', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'tasteless'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very nicely decorated'], ['Room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'great panoramic view'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'good']]

Good find in Paris A good hotel away from the main touristy areas of Paris . Staff were very friendly , helpful and the accomodation was a fair size . Although the bathroom in my room seemed a little dated compared to others in the hotel , the whole room very clean and comfortable offering excellent value for money .

A Beautiful Place in a Very Good Location Stayed here for three nights in June 2008 , 2 adults and 2 teenagers in the annex rooms , second ( third ) floor . An absolutely beautiful place , clean and new with real Venetian decor ( go to the Ca ' Rezzonico museum and see the same style furniture you have in your room ! ) . Breakfast was very good featuring home made apple croissants . I am a super light sleeper and on the first night heard noises from the private residence above our room - Walter and Sandro at the front desk contacted owner of the building the next day and immediately resolved the issue , they were super nice and helpful .

Functional downtown hotel Stayed for 2 nights in July 06 , a functional hotel located slightly away from downtown but within 10 minutes walk of most of the sights . I ' d have this down as a 3 star rather than 2 . 5 . Received a warm welcome on arrival , and we were able to check - in despite arriving early , lots of information offered by the reception staff and secure underground parking ( for $ 16 per day ) . Room was clean but not huge . The receptionist advised that the hotel was going to be refurbished later in the year , but it had cable TV , air con and everything else you need when your planning to spend most of your time exploring a fantastic city like Seattle . Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the first day but it was over - priced and the food wasn ' t great . On the second day we chose to go to one of the many local coffee shops , which was much better and cheaper !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Functional'], ['reception staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['Room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Room', 'rooms design_features', 'neutral', 'not huge'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'over - priced'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', "wasn ' t great"]]
Prescott - A lifesaver THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n ' t provide high speed access . They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop . I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time . THe only reason I didn ' t give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service .

Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect , staff were great . Room was very small but was perfect for us , it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom . We stayed for three nights in total , it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay ( 1 week ) . As mentioned in other reviews , it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere . Would definetely recommend Residence Foch , the area was perfect , literally max ten mins walk from the Arc de Troimph , lovely safe area .####[['Residence Foch', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'great'], ['Room', 'rooms design_features', 'neutral', 'very small but was perfect'], ['Room', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'including a minibar'], ['bathroom', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['Room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small'], ['Residence Foch', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definetely recommend'], ['Residence Foch', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'area was perfect']]

Perfect Location . . . Fun Hotel Just returned from a two - night stay at the Triton , and I have to say my experience was in contrast to that of some of the other reviewers who felt there was a lack of restaurants in the neighborhood or that the staff wasn ' t helpful enough . We received excellent recommendations for dining in the neighborhood ( Taylor St . , Ryoko and Le Colonial ) both nights of our stay from helpful concierge , Nick . Add to that a perfect location - - practically in Chinatown , right next to Union Square , and convenient to the waterfront - - and a fun decor .

Lovely hosts , but catered towards Americans The hotel is quaint with a lovely terrace and nice hosts , but seemed as if this place was more geared towards americans , with some surprise at guests that are not americans ( i . e . us ) . This is probably due to the american wife of the owner couple . Unfortunately this made the hotel seem less diverse , whereas Florence is very diverse ! !

Mislead in cost of internet access I stayed here for three nights the last week of December . It is a good hotel in a good location but : - The hotel ' s web site implies that internet access is free but that isn ' t so ; they charge $ 9 . 95 / day regardless of whether you use the provided ethernet cable or wi - fi ( aT - mobile service ) . I used the ethernet cable , but the process of authorizing the charge each day took about five minutes ( the system is very slow ) . - Valet parking costs $ 31 / day . - The restaurant ( Cafe 15 ) had very slow service when I eat there , even though they weren ' t doing much business .####[['cost of internet access', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'Mislead'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'good'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'good'], ['service', 'service general', 'negative', 'slow']]

Loved the Apex City Of London Hotel Booked the Apex City of London Hotel for 2 nights based on the reviews on Tripadvisor . I was not disappointed .

Convenient , Staff Superb The staff at this hotel are great and go above and beyond the call of duty . I had a terrible case of strepped throat and without delay upon check in and without asking , hot tea , lemon , and biscuits were delivered to my room to help my voice .

Decent package deal Hotel room was decent for the price paid for . It did show some age in the walls and furniture but serves the purpose for a place to stay .

Great Hotel Great location I booked this hotel as a result of reading the reviews . The positive reviews are all correct . This is a new hotel in a great location for a short break visit to Barcelona . 50m from the Cathedral , 200m from Las Ramblas , and 400m from Plaza Cataluyna which is the central arrival point of trains and buses from the airport . The staff are friendly , rooms and general areas clean , and the beds large and comfortable .

Highly recommended We stayed in the Lorenzo Il Magnifico for 3 nights in August 2004 . The standard of the accommodation was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful - to the extent that they sent out for a takeaway pizza on our behalf when my wife was feeling unwell .

A nice touch was the complimentary desert from the hotel management on the occaision of my wife ' s 40th birthday .

Rust , mold and cold water While the refurbished lobby , restaurants and bars are still elegant and luxurious , the standard rooms are far more reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room . Chipped paint , rusting fixtures , moldy grout and an utter lack of amenities . The assorted selections of soaps and shampoos , apparently borrowed from other hotels , is not critical , but is indicative of the curent state of the Biltmore . Waking up to find a mixture of cold to luke warm water dribbling out of the five foot high showerhead only reinforced an already negative impression . The staff are certainly accomodating and room service was adequate , but I would wait until a complete renovation of the rooms before ever staying at the Biltmore again .####[['rooms', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'reminiscent of a decrepit dorm room'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'Chipped paint'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'rusting fixtures'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'moldy grout'], ['rooms', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'lack of amenities'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'accomodating'], ['room service', 'service general', 'positive', 'adequate'], ['Biltmore', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Wouldn ' t atay anywhere else in Manahattan Over the past ten years , we have stayed at Hotel Beacon four times and - having stayed at some other hotels - we would never stay anywhere else in NYC , The rooms are huge and very comfortable with a small but well - equipped kitchenette . It ' s a great location , stunning views to Central Park or the Hudson from the upper floors - don ' t forget to ask when booking because they do try to give you what you request ; buses and subway within moments of the door - or just walk to Columbus , Amsterdam , Central Park , even Mid - Town . One particularly brilliant aspect of Hotel Beacon : Fairways foodstore directly across Broadway from the Beacon . a jaw - dropping selection of stuff to eat , including a hot food counter which makes eating in any restaurant a bit of a waste of time : grab a bottle of wine at the Beacon Liquor store , Korean chicken or something at Fairways then dine at your Hotel Beacon room window overlooking a million Manhattan lights . Unforgetable .

Restaurant Hotel is very nice . Restaurant is overpriced and the food is way below average . The manager Alex is way too arrogant and thinks he is doing you a favor for this very mediocre restaurant . Prices for this New York City eaterie is outragious when one can venture just down the block and go to a very fine resataurant named Keen ' s on west 36th Street for the same prices and have a far superior New York restaurant experience . Although hotel and roof top is a very nice amenity defintely stay away from their restaurant and their very arrogant mangager Alex .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['Restaurant', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'overpriced'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'way below average'], ['manager Alex', 'service general', 'negative', 'too arrogant'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['roof top', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice']]

Three cheers for the Ramada I have travelled to Amsterdam many times but this is the best value for money hotel in it ' s class bar none . My room was imaculate with a comfy bed and was well designed with a cool bathroom and deep bath . The location cannot really be improved upon as it is a mere 5 min . walk to central station and even backs onto a little known red light area for some late night action . The only downsides are the lack of air - con and a fridge , but hey you do get a fan and a fridge is not essential really . All for about 拢40 per night , I have paid considerably more for a lot less , get it booked .####[['Ramada', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'best value for money'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'imaculate'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfy bed'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'well designed'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'cool bathroom'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['NULL', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'lack of air - con and a fridge'], ['Ramada', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'paid considerably more for a lot less']]

Perfect July 10 - 16 , 2008 . A steal for Venezia ; includes gondola traffic ( Oye ! ! ! ) , singers and musicians ( on the boats ) - just open your window .

Location , Location , Location We enjoyed a 3 day stay at the Parc 55 ! The location is the best because of the proximity to BART ( across the street ) , and the cable cars ( 1 block away ) . Westfield Shopping Center is located directly across the street ( Nordstroms , Bloomingdale , great food court too ) . The service and the rooms were excellent and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco that would like to be close to the shopping and public transportation . It is right on Market Street , and is close to Chinatown . Parking is a little pricey at $ 40 for overnight ; however , parking is at a premium at this location . We found great rates for this hotel on Expedia ; however , I would recommend that you check out their website ( Parc 55 ) first because they have several special package rates .####[['Parc 55', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'enjoyed'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'best'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['Parc 55', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend']]
Worst hotel ever ! ! ! ! ! ! This was the worst place I have ever stayed . The bathroom smelled so badly like mold that we could not open the door without the entire room smelling .

Matchless in Midtown This hotel is so well located , within walking distance of Grand Central Terminal , and ideal for theatergoers . It is a fairly new tall and narrow building squeezed between two larger ones so there ' s little natural light , but the rooms are what you ' d typically expect from a Marriott Courtyard , and surprisingly roomy for Manhattan . . . clean with comfortable bedding and plush towels , free internet , good in - room coffee ( avoid the lobby machine stuff ) , flat screen TV , and most of all , a very professional and helpful staff . ( We did not choose to use their breakfast option ) . And the price . . . $ 299 for a king - size . . . is matchless for a nice place in midtown . We will definitely return .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'well located'], ['hotel', 'hotel miscellaneous', 'neutral', 'little natural light'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable bedding'], ['rooms', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'plush towels'], ['internet', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very professional'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['price', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'NULL']]
loved this place My girlfriends i stayed here for a week , We had the best time ever . Everyone there was very courtious with an exception of the unhappy young front desk girl but Orlando down on the beach made up for that . Our room was good sized and our room looked out to the beach . The only downfall to this getaway was when it was time to take a Taxi back to the airport . I highly recommend this place to others and highly anticipate my oppurtunity to go again in December .####[['Everyone', 'service general', 'positive', 'very courtious'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'loved'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'best time ever'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'good sized'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'looked out to the beach'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend']]
Fantastic location ! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Alicia . Didn ' t experience any of the previous reviewer ' s problems . The location is just ideal , easy walking distance to the 3 main museums and to the palace .

Great location , but needs an update My husband and I spent one night at this hotel before flying out early the next morning . For what we needed this hotel served its purpose - - it was close to the train station , which we wanted since we were arriving by train , we didn ' t need breakfast since we were leaving so early , we were able to book one night only ( through Expedia ) despite the fact that it was a weekend , and the front desk was manned 24 hours so they were able to check us out when we left and they got us a cab . The hotel could use some freshening up , and I agree that it ' s not four - star quality . However , the location can ' t be beat and some of the views are amazing .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['front desk', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'some freshening up'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'views are amazing']]

Great Start to the Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel for 3 nights in August as the ' activity ' part of our honeymoon , we booked it soley as a result of its ( previous ) number 1 position on Trip Advisor . The hotel is super , rooms were great , staff were friendly but the location was just fantastic as we managed to walk most places ( Times Square , Macy ' s , Rockerfeller , Empire State ) and it was easy to get the Metro from Times Square for other attractions ( Staten Island , Brooklyn Bridge ) . We ate breakfast every morning at the Red Flame Diner just down the road which was fab .

charming clean hotel Just returned from our trip to Florence . We found this hotel to be all we needed for 3 people . It is clean , with wall to wall hard wood floors , sound proof windows , large modern bathroom and kitchenette which is great for late night or for early morning snacks .

Good location - otherwise horrible I got the hotel because it was in a good location and the reviews looked plausibly ok however I was very dissapointed . It was in a good location , right next to Chinatown , but it should not be called a hotel , but a cheap motel or a hovel . The room may have been cleaned before we got there , but it was so old that you couldn ' t tell for sure . Furniture , carpet , bathroom all in horrible condition . Even though it was cheap ~ $ 75 / night , it really wasn ' t worth it .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'horrible'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'very dissapointed'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'cleaned'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'so old'], ['NULL', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'horrible condition'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', "wasn ' t worth it"], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'cheap']]
A Quality Hotel in a Perfect Location ! The Ramada City Centre is a quality hotel that offers all of the services and facilities that are expected from a hotel under the ownership of a major company . The rooms are of a reasonable size with standard tv , radio , telephone , fan , safe , trouser press and tea and coffee making facilites . I stayed for 4 nights and am pleased to report that the room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were also provided daily . The hotel had an impressive large 24 hour reception area , lounge , restaurant and bar , all appeared to be recently renovated / decorated .

There are Better Options than this tired , outdated hotel I give it two circles instead of 1 , only because of its location next to the Hynes convention center and Prudential Center . We paid $ 250 per night ( convention rate ) for a cramped room with low ceilings , outdated furnishings , and paint peeling from the ceiling . The hotel is not friendly to families with young children , and charges extra for items included in lower priced chains , e . g . extra fee to use the fitness center and pool , along with internet .

Great quality for the budget minded traveller We were budget conscious when booking the hotel and its services far exceeded my expectations . Its location was fantastic , close to all the attractions , and transport via the Metro is literally 30sec away .

Safer than expected Having read some reviews of this hotel we , as pensioners , were rather apprehensive about tales of dodgy characters and threatening transients in the vicinity of the hotel . However we have just returned from 6 days at the Della Natione and at no time did we feel unsafe or threatened , we also found the Duomo to be a 7 minute walk away not 15 and we are in our 60 ' s . The hotel was comfortable , we had a quiet room which was cleaned regularly together with the bathroom and although the breakfast was continental it was more than adequate with supplies of foods being constantly replenished .

great value for money , good area Me and 4 friends stayed in this motel for a few nights in October and were very pleased with the value for money . The motel is indeed on Lombard Street , which is in fact a section of the 101 , but as we had rooms away from the street we didn ' t have any trouble with the noise . The rooms themselves were pretty much the same as any motel room we saw during our round trip , nothing exceptional but very adequate . The biggest plus is the area , it ' s in a nice little neighbourhood with shops and some excellent dining right around the corner ! We particularly enjoyed ' Barneys ' with its ' gourmet burgers ' . It ' s not downtown , but a short busride has you in the heart of Chinatown in no time .####[['motel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great value for money'], ['motel', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'neutral', 'nothing exceptional but very adequate']]

Excellent Hotel , very helpful staff We booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights before our cruise . The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona , within a few yards to the underground , five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available . We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port ( 12 - 20 euro , depending on the driver ) . The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily . The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop . The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9 . 50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited .

Great Weekend Getaway Flying down from a colddd Baltimore to Miama and staying 4 days at the Sonesta was a real pleasure . It is only a block away from the heart of Coconut Grove , a very cool little town , and across the street from a nice park ( including a skateboard park my son loved ) . The hotel ' s 8th floor swimming pool has a fantastic view of the bay , as did our room .

Our Home in Florence This hotel feels much more like a home than an institution - - for us , that feeling came from the moment we met Carmel , who grew up in Boston , and she invited us upstairs onto her lovely outside terrace . Located near enough to the train station to be convenient for travel but on a side street , Hotel Il Bargellino is also near to several Florentine sights . Our only complaint was that the noice from the street can be a little annoying late at night , but it ' s a trade - off for being right in close proximity to so much . Carmel enticed us as customers by helping us find the best accomodations in her hotel , and we will stay here again upon our next trip to Florence .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'feels much more like a home'], ['Carmel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

Loved the Marriott Marquis New York Stayed at this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor . The hotel was fantastic we were made to feel special , nothing was too much trouble for the staff . We had a Time Square view at no extra cost , the room was huge with sofa ' s and chairs , the bed was huge clean linen every day . We had concerns about the lifts after reading some of the reviews but I don ' t think we ever had to wait more than a minute for a lift .

Most Disappointed Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months , we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September . Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations , and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising . We were incredulous that when we arrived , the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us . This attitude , combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom , led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor . We would not recommend staying at this hotel .####[['The Chancellor', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Most Disappointed'], ['The Chancellor', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'did not live up to our expectations'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'unfriendly'], ['front desk', 'service general', 'negative', 'very tired'], ['bedroom', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'shabby looking'], ['The Chancellor', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'disappointing stay'], ['The Chancellor', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not recommend']]

The room was not fancy , but was large and very clean and comfortable . This hotel is not on the beach but a beautiful beach is very near by . The only problems we encountered were very few signs directing us to the hotel and when we called the first time , the desk clerk was unable to give us directions from the town plaza which was less than 1 mile away .

most inaccessible hotel of the world This is an example of a poorly planned , new hotel tower on top of an old department store . To get to your room requires 2 different elevators and a hike across the lobby . Pity of you arrive by car ; NO PARKING ; NO CAR DROPOFF . No Taxis either at most times !

Give It A Miss The hotel is in a great location , but I would have serious doubts in recommending the hotel as there are several deficiencies that need immediate attention . Hotel is in need of some seious maintenance i . e . broken counter tops , leaking taps , no self closing room doors , window locks not working and musty stench from stairwells . There is no parking at the hotel and runs $ 18 - $ 25 per day plus tax . No High Speed Internet access at all is available , you have to cross the road to a sister property ' s lobby and pay $ 10 a day .

Gem of a hotel This is a particularly agreeable hotel with friendly staff , nice furnishings , and excellent value for money given the included breakfast , wine / cheese evenings , and coffee and tea on - tap , so to speak . Our petite double room was , as expected , space - challenged , but clever use of the available space minimized the bother , and for a 2 - night stay it was not a problem . For longer stays , I would invest in a larger room . Particularly appreciated was the ability to set up my laptop and connect to the internet for free without having to re - arrange the furniture , unplug lamps , and so on ( which is so often the case at more expensive hotels ) .

Great value for money and one stop from Hollywood Myself and three of my friends stayed at this Hotel as part of a miniature Californian tour . It was clean , the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway . The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood . There is a five minute walk to the subway / rail station and then one stop and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre , this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel . Overall this Hotel provides clean accomodation and serves perfectly as a base for those who wish to go out drinking in Hollywood .####[['Hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Great value for money'], ['Hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'relatively close proximity to Hollywood'], ['accomodation', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean']]

Good - sized clean rooms but service could be improved We booked a standard room at the Villa Mazarin . We found it centrally located ( we walked to most of the major tourist sites ) and the rooms were decent sized and comfortable .

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities , but since I came here on business , I needed an internet connection in my room . That service was sorely lacking . Not only that , the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them . This may sound insignificant , but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center , this hotel gets a big fat zero .

New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors . No regret at all contrarely the best price / quality / service i had since i travel to HK ( 12 years for business ) . Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner ( if you want ) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality . Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting , just and just more than what you need , all perfectly well organized and controlled . Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong . Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities .####[['Langham Place', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'best price'], ['Langham Place', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'quality'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['facilities', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

Like a lot of other reviewers , i thought the room was small but in a place like Hong Kong you shouldn ' t be spending too much time there .

About 10 minutes walk from the busy streets of Causeway Bay , but 30 seconds from the MTR station and trams which are cheap and reliable ( buy an Octupus card at the airport ! ) .

Very good time Returned 1 / 5 - first trip there . Apparently , less crowded than the week before . We had very good service all around . Also discovered one of the few people in the Caribbean who can remove a cork from the inside of an empty wine bottle - he is Luis the Maitre ' d at Le Gourmet , one of the reservation only restaurants . If you go there , make it a point to see him .####[['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'good'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Very good time']]
Mediocre cleaning , mediocre breakfast buffet Was not asked about room preference at check - in and got one stinking with old cigarettes . Happily we were offered a non - smoking room within 30 minutes after we complained . The glasses and cups we used in the room were not changed by the cleaning lady , just wiped off . The breakfast buffet was ok , but not up to the standards one should expect from a 4 - star hotel .

weekend at the westin this is a very nice hotel in a very good location in downtown dallas . the beds were soft . the shower was a heavenly shower with very good water pressure . the towels were very thick and soft . no pool . the only bad thing about this hotel is that it is connected to the plaza of the americas office complex which is closed on the weekends . so all of the shops are not open . there is an ice skating rink that is open for limited skating . pay the $ 20 for valet parking unless you plan to drive to other parts of dallas . the dart train is only about 2 blocks from the front door .####[['westin', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice hotel'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'soft'], ['shower', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Superb ! My husband and I just spent four wonderful nights ( and mornings and afternoons ) at Matteo ' s beautiful new small elegant hotel on the Grand Canal . His great hospitality creates a house party atmosphere where guests are treated , and treat each other , like old friends .

very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful . The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money .

Fantastic pools , shame about teh beach replenishment Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in October 2008 , and whilst the rooms were pretty bland the pools and outside areas facing the beach are lovely . 3 pools - one infinity , one with a pool bar and a spa pool . The hotel is right on the beach but the beach was being replenished during our stay so you couldn ' t actually use it and had to walk to the main Kuta beach ( about 5 - 10 minutes ) .

My base in Hong Kong There are plenty of good comments about this hotel already posted here on Trip Advisor . This is a well run , clean and nicely appointed hotel that is very handy for the airport as well as being only a few stops on the MRT to Central Hong Kong . The hotel is attached to a newly built shopping centre . If you can live without the hussle and bussle of a city centre then this hotel is a good option . I am in Asia 6 or 7 times a year and use this property as my base from which I then travel in and out from the nearby airpor####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'well run'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'nicely appointed'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'attached to a newly built shopping centre']]
reviews are spot on excellent location - restauarants and bars are all on the street right in front of the hotel . sites very easily accesible with both the u bahn and s bahn right outside the door . we didnt have breakfast - its 15 euros but if book day before its 11 . To be honest though , once you have found a place to eat , ordered juice , coffee and say crambled eggs you have pretty much spent that anyway so it is probably worth it as its a buffet . bar in hotel nice to start in or have a drink before bed . if you stay in the front of the hotel - the windows are transparent ! we stayed with two children and hotel was fi####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['buffet', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'worth it']]

clean and New Hotel This is a very new hotel , it is a non - smoking hotel , which was pleasant . The location is very close to the center , tram way is outside the hotel about 1 mins walk , and there is a bike hire place on the basement of the hotel which was very convenient as cycling is one of the easiest way to get around Amsterdam in the day or at night . The room is very big and the toilet is state of the art . Only complain is the free wifi is on the slow side of things . The buffet was really good , and the dinner at the restaurant is nice with very nice view of the river and the other side .####[['Hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'New'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very close to the center'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'very big'], ['toilet', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'state of the art'], ['wifi', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['wifi', 'facilities quality', 'negative', 'slow side of things'], ['buffet', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'really good'], ['restaurant', 'facilities design_features', 'positive', 'very nice view of the river']]

lub is great ! We stayed here for 3 nights in club and although the rooms are on the small side and showers lack any real power it was Jean and Joyce , the concierge , that made our stay here more than comfortable . They arranged everything from reservations in the best restaurant in the South West ( Binkley ' s ) to a hot air balloon ride over the desert , they just could not do enough ! The Club lounge is exactly as a lounge should be , full of great food and masses of free drinks all through the day and more information about the area than you can shake a library at .

Great Little Boutique Hotel ! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations , excellent service by the hotel staff , and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel . Breakfast is served each morning , with a generous choice of bakery , meat , egg , fruit , and drink choices . While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town , we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites . Our room was clean , spacious , and we enjoyed a magnificent view which was perfect at sunset .

Such elegance ! I loved The Kimberly ! It ' s small , as hotels go , but I never felt claustrophobic in it and especially not in my room . The parlor was comfortable , the kitchen surprisingly complete , and the bedroom was QUITE spacious with an awesome bed . The staff was delightful , especially the doorman , an older African American man , who was quick with a smile and never , ever gave me the feeling he was looking for a tip ( which made me tip him more ! ) . It ' s conveniently located to many midtown attractions and also the subway at 51st and Lexington . I would definitely stay here again , but word to the wise : make sure you get your car out of the garage within a 24 hour time period or they will charge you for an extra day , even if you ' re only a minute or two late !####[['The Kimberly', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['parlor', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['kitchen', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'surprisingly complete'], ['bedroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'QUITE spacious'], ['bed', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'awesome'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'delightful'], ['The Kimberly', 'location general', 'positive', 'conveniently located'], ['The Kimberly', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely stay here again']]

Decent with good quality / price ratio , but noisy The hotel is in a good location , the rooms , at least the low priced one i got , are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there . The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm . I tried to put the room temperature regulation on , but the fan was really noisy , so i opted for an extra blanket . My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings .

firmed reservation , but no room available when we arrived I reserved two rooms several months in advance and confirmed them via email one week before arrival .

Unfortunately , the Colon Hotel rooms turned out to be run down , with stained upholstery , linens , and carpeting , no air conditioning , and an old , lumpy bed . We found a new hotel .

Highly recommend the Berchielli We spent 2 nights at the Berchielli last week , and the experience was completely delightful : perfect location ( on the river , an easy walk to the Ponte Vecchio ) ; friendly , attentive staff ; spotless , attractive rooms ; and an excellent ( hot ) American breakfast . Other family members had spectacular river views through 2 huge windows in their rooms . My single room , which I referred to as the princess room , since you went up 2 flights of stairs to enter the sleeping / bath area after you came in the door , had no view , but was so delightfully quiet that I happily accepted the trade - off .

Excellent value I stayed at the Affinia Dumont on my third business trip to New York , and this is the best hotel value for the money in NYC or anywhere else . It ' s perfect for those wanting to mix business and pleasure thanks to an enormous desk and Aeron chair as well as a lovely looking spa ( I just used the yoga room one morning ) . Also a well - equiped fitness room , which I didn ' t need because I walked 6 to 10 miles a day ! The elements that made this a standout for me were the excellent lighting ( including some energy - efficient fixtures ) - - especially the reading lights over the bed , over the desk , and by the reading chair - - and the great mirrors everywhere you could possibly want them .

Noisy . . . I must admit the Hotel Fusion is a great bargain in a great location . My room was large but basic . My only compaint is that while they went to great lengths to renovate the hotel they overlooked one detail , insulated windows . I was on the 4th floor and the street noise penetrating into my room overnight was almost unbearable . I am not a light sleeper and if you are I would recommend staying somewhere else .####[['Hotel Fusion', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great bargain'], ['Hotel Fusion', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'Noisy'], ['Hotel Fusion', 'location general', 'positive', 'great location'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'basic'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'street noise penetrating'], ['Hotel Fusion', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'recommend staying somewhere else']]
Excellent I stayed there with a mate having arrived after 15hrs on planes from New York , Madrid and Barcelona . The staff were friendly and welcoming right from the start , with plenty of charm and good humour ( which we found unusual in Spain on the whole ) ! Rooms were very clean and well maintained . It ' s in a great location for the night - life ( ramblas ) and was within easy walking distance of good bars , resturants , and other attractions . I ' lld recomend this mainly for younger people , singles or couples as the nightlife in the immediate area is vibrant to say the least . Overall , a great hotel with excellant service , presentation and modern amenities , would stay there again without doubt .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'welcoming right from the start'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'plenty of charm and good humour'], ['Rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'great location'], ['hotel', 'hotel miscellaneous', 'positive', 'recomend this mainly for younger people , singles or couples'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellant'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'presentation and modern amenities'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'stay there again without doubt']]
Good location , comfy beds Rooms were great although the bedroom area was a little on the small side , the bathrooms and comfortable beds really made up for this . All sights within easy walking distance - 5 mins walk to the flower market and 15 - 20 mins to Museumplein . Near to metro , trams and canalbus stops . Just round the corner from the hotel is Utrechtsestraat which contains some of the best restaurants in Amsterdam . During our stay there was a lot of unexpected construction work ( both to us and the hotel ) which the hotel kindly compensated us for . Would definitely stay here again .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'Good location'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfy'], ['Rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great'], ['bedroom area', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'little on the small side '], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'All sights within easy walking distance'], ['hotel', 'service general', 'positive', 'kindly compensated us for'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely stay here again']]
very good experience at this hotel Stayed for 2 nights while touring through Texas . Located to the north of the city but convenient for attractions ( if you have a car ) . we did the JFK museum in downtown Dallas before heading over to Fort Worth Stockyards and then to Southfork Ranch so you can do these attractions in a day from this base . Nice restaurants and other facilities . Excellent well appointed room at very competitive rate .

Elegant Hotel , excellent position , but some minor flaws We stayed here in late September 2003 , and would recommend it for position , and its effortless elegance and style . A five minute walk from the Duomo and various excellent side - street restaurants make it a very strong choice . That said , those minor flaws : as in other hotels , rooms vary in quality from tired and jaded to newly refurbished with Tuscan pain effects - so negotiate for the better ones . Breakfast was mediocre with catering being run by an outside conmtractor ! Be prepared to part with $ 25 a day for parking as well . But overall the setting - especially the roof - top bar terrace - gave this a very strong rating .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Elegant'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent position'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'mediocre'], ['parking', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['roof - top bar terrace', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Fine but pricey stayed here for a long weekend - nice hotel and obviously can ' t beat the location - we were in the castle club which is worth the extra money as had ' character breakfasts ' every morning - that way you can gets lots of photos and avoid eating in the hotel for lunch and dinner - had the buffet at the Inventions restaurant one night which was awful - go up to the Disney Village if you want to eat something decent for half the price - there is a planet hollywood and a few other acceptable chains in the village - good standard of room but OD ' d on the air freshner - very comfy beds - staff were fine - kids loved the weekend though which is the whole point - still considering the cost could make a better effort to feed the grown ups####[['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'pricey'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', "can ' t beat the location"], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'good standard'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very comfy'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'fine']]
blissful retreat It was a while ago , but we adored Uma Sapna . Having our own pool was fabulous .

Great place to stay We have now stayed at the Nob Hill Motor Inn three times and have been there several nights each time we were in San Franscisco . We have never been disappointed .

Great stay I stayed here for a week in June , and thoroughly enjoyed my stay . For an airport hotel , it was surprisingly quiet , rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared , and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous .

Fantastic Palace Just back from a long weekend over Paddy ' s day and this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in . The staff were all more than happy to help and always met us with a smile . The hotel is fantastically placed 1 block from 5th Avenue and about 5 mins from Central Park . Food was excellent , however , we preferred to eat out just to make the most of the trip .

OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area , however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy , didn ' t get too much sleep during our stay . Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom . The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say , which was further than I had originally thought , but it was easy to find our way around . Didn ' t have breakfasts at the hotel .

Friendly , helpful staff The best part of Casci is the staff . They were very helpful with recommendations - directions , restaurants , etc . This was our second hotel in Florence , and compared to the first , Casci had a little more of a hostel kind of feel - signs in the bathroom asking you not to clean your laundry in the sink , for example . This was the quietest of all hotels we stayed at , which was nice .

Avoid at all costs How this place can call itself a 4 . 5 / 5 star hotel is beyond me - obviously the management have no grasp of hospitality unless they previosuly ran a prison or similar .

lean but Noisy Reasonably clean , great location by attractions but horrifically noisy , both from street traffic and denizens of the hotel itself . Staff was very nice .

Nice place to stay The Residence Michalangiolo has fantastic rooms , and is run by the nicest freindliest people you could hope to meet . It is easy walking distance to the centre of Florence or there is a great inexpensive bus service .

Loved It After reading the reviews on this site , I was terrified of my choice , but had already paid in full through Expedia . The hotel turned out better than I expected and I completely relaxed . Room was charming , although it was the absolute smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in , and the bathroom was really itty bitty ! Didn ' t have much contact with the staff , but what contact I did have was pleaseant . I arrived at the hotel at 11 a . m . was allowed to check in , which helped me enjoy a full day in San Francisco without worrying about check in times , etc .

I ' m a fussy devil , and where possible do like to stay in 4 * hotels , but I could not find fault with this hotel other than there was no tea - making facilities in the room . I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['room', 'room_amenities general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
venient , helpful  I stayed here as a single female and it was a great place to be . The concierge was able to recommend great restaurants and trips , and the hotel is right next to lots of the sights , and the cable car turnaround so it ' s easy to get anywhere . Downside - I would have preferred facilities other than the adjoining seafood restaurant for breakfast etc . Definitely recommend .####[['concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Definitely recommend']]

Lovely Having stayed in the Sofitel in New York and thoroughly enjoying it - I decided to give the London one a try - and I wasn ' t disappointed . Very simply it was lovely ! Concierge - helpful and friendlyFront desk - friendly and efficientRoom - absolutely lovely - particularly the shower ! and spotlessly clean . Also really quiet due to very good double glazing - so between the quietness and the comfortable bed I had a fantastic night ' s sleep . Bar area - friendly . I was slightly worried that they might have been a bit pompous - but not at all ! I would be delighted to have an opportunity to stay here again .####[['Sofitel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Lovely'], ['Concierge', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful and friendly'], ['Front desk', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly and efficient'], ['Room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'absolutely lovely'], ['shower', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'absolutely lovely'], ['Room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'spotlessly clean'], ['Room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'really quiet'], ['bed', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['Bar area', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'friendly']]

MICE PROBLEMS The W Hotel has really gone downhill since its change of owners . Used to be an okay hotel with balinese style decor . Now the decor looks old and is in need of updates , they have scimped on wait help so the service is extremely bad and THEY HAVE MICE PROBLEMS ! A bit scary as we were coming home from dinner one night , a small little creature went scurrying across the floor to our horror !

Not the worst hotel ever . . . . . . but nothing special . The hotel is very dated and dingy , with a funky smell throughout . Room was tolerable but not the cleanest .

Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra . I highly recomend this quaint , perfectly located hotel . just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno , the location is perfecto . More importanly , the rooms were spacious and comfortable . The service stands out as some of the best I have experience - the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals .

Good airport hotel Nice hotel close to the airport . Our room was on the top floor and was a non - smoking room that was still a little stuffy ( smokey ? ) .

Overall good , but too expensive Overall it was a good hotel , but I think too expensive .

Loved Alam Kulkul We stayed our last night in Bali at Alam Kulkul , as soon as we entered the room , we liked it , even though our room was on the very last corner , but the atmosphere inside was homey , it was not modernly designed or looked new , but very comfortable . I think it was because the room was bright . We also tried their Jamu Spa treatment : Hot Stone massage and Warm tea leaves Facial which was divine . We definitely will come back to Alam Kulkul in our next trip to Bali , and that time we would like to try their villa , which we ' re sure that is well groomed too , just like their hotel room . We highly recommend alam kulkul to everyone .####[['Alam Kulkul', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Loved'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'liked it'], ['Alam Kulkul', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'atmosphere inside was homey'], ['Alam Kulkul', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'well groomed'], ['Alam Kulkul', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend']]
Good choice for central location Clean with nice decor and reasonably large rooms . Excellent location about 10 - minutes walk from Barri Gothic and 15minutes from the SAngria Familia . The hotel is great as a base base to visit the sites or even if you are there on business ( free internet connection ) . However there are few facilities outside the room and the food ( breakfast only ) is very limitted in range and quality - for 6 euros you would be much better visitting on of the many local cafes .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'central location'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'Clean'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'nice decor'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'reasonably large'], ['internet connection', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['food', 'food_drinks style_options', 'negative', 'very limitted in range and quality']]
Not so charming It was nice that the hotel had an old charm feeling but underneath it all it was run down and dirty . The girls staying next to me found cochroaches in their bathroom .

Hotel Carton review Booked a room at this hotel for a great price after reading some good reviews on TA . Staff were very pleasant , rooms were clean and modern , location was great , although one wrong turn and you could end up near the tenderloin , although to their credit , the staff at the hotel tell you this immediately . When you check in , they give you a map , and tell you exactly where not to go , so you really have no excuses . However , as said before , the location is great and you ' re close ( walking distance ) to some great places .

The rooms are beautiful , spotlessly clean .

Wonderful Staff , Great Place On a sold - out summer weekend day ( Saturday July 28 , 2007 ) , we found ourselves in big trouble because of a misunderstanding of the room type at the time of online reservation . The hotel staff went out of their way to resolve the situation to our satisfaction . The stay in this place was great . This Hotel is located within a block of Seattle center / Space Needle , and is within a 2 mintue monorail ride or a short drive from downtown / Pike Market area . The room and particularly the beds are very comfortable , and the breakfast is quite good .

perfect Me and my wife came from Iceland to Barcelona to celebrate her birthday and chose the Pulitzer . From now on this is our hotel in Barcelona . I booked a romantic / celebration stay and it was perfect , from a bottle of Cava waiting in our room which was spacious and welcoming to booking a perfect meal at Quatre Gats restaurant . When we came back from the meal a hot bath was waiting for my wife with cava , strawberries and chocolate and the room decorated with roses , perfect . Front desk and all staff was perfect , they organised a masseuse to come to our room for a deep and relaxing massage for my wife .

Perfect stay was a bit concerned after reading mixed reviews but would highly reccomend this hotel , we were upgraded to sea front view and as it was my 30th birthday they had a complimentary cake waiting for me in my room ! ! the hotel staff could not do enough , very accomodating . The breakfast was amazing and it was lovely sitting out in the early morning sun to eat it .

Great Rooms , Noisy Location We spent 4 nights at this hotel in Madrid . The hotel itself is in excellent condition and our room was clean and very comfortable . You could easily walk to all the sights from this location , which made it convenient . The breakfast was top notch as was the lovely rooftop bar . The hotel staff were nice , but were not at all helpful in recommending restaurants .

highly recommend I ' ve stayed at this hotel four or five times now . The service is excellent , and the accomodations are quite lovely . Can ' t beat the convenient location , as it is very near the subway with lots of taxis and busses . A light breakfast is included in your stay in the lobby , or for an extra $ 5 you can have it delivered to your room . The staff is very friendly .

Good Hotel Must have stayed in a different hotel from the last review . We were here as part of a Kuoni tour and we were delighted with this hotel . Our room had recently been refurbished and was lovely with even a drinking water tap . Very clean and comfortable and a good size The garden was fantastic - really peaceful when you think you are in the middle of Beijing .

>If only other hotels can learn from this Omni Our family of four stayed at the Omni San Francisco for a too short 4 - day weekend . We have stayed at a number of other hotels ( including the Ritz - Carlton ) over the years and can honestly say that this was the absolute best experience we have ever had . Everyone on staff was incredible and made us feel that we were the only guests there even though the hotel was sold out !

My Birthday meal I havnt stayed at this hotel but while staying in Barcelona my wife took me to the Torres for a meal on my birthday . The views are astounding and we were given a table with excellent views of the Magic Fountains which started performing at 21 . 00 hrs and the show was spectacular . The food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpfull and also very knowledgeable about the menus , wine and food . I am a qualifed Chef and my wife and I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world including what is listed as THE best restaurant in the world at the moment by renowned Chefs , The Fat Duck in Bray , UK and found the food and service in The Torres to be of an extremely high standard .

I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard . This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful . Maybe I got unlucky , but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics , I decided to leave the property all together . The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch . Although the bar is nice and the breakfast , the one day I did stay , was excellent , I ' ve become accustomed to a higher standard and comfort from my room .####[['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'very nice central interrior'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely helpful'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'located far from the french quarter'], ['bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'smell'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'other unatractive characteristics']]

Great location , clean with helpful staff We booked for 4 nights in mid - September as we had previously stayed here 3 years ago . Since then the hotel has been given a face - lift .

Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years . In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags . The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening , did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them , begging to be let in . The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities , as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk . Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'unsavory'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'should be avoided'], ['night manager', 'service general', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Beyond 5 stars I am 57 years old and have travelled extensively and stayed in many beautiful hotels , but the Drake Hotel now sits at the top of my list .

Rather Disappointed ! Dear Reader , after our recent one night stay at the Bali Hyatt , we unfortunately have to confirm the negative review written by LukePerth dated Nov 18 , 2008 . Our room was very humid and loud , which may relate to the structural set - up of the hotel property . We think that it could be worthwhile to invest some more $ $ $ and stay at the Sheraton Laguna Beach Resort in Nusa Dua .####[['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'very humid and loud'], ['Bali Hyatt', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Rather Disappointed']]
Very good hotel We booked this hotel for the last night of our vacation using our Marriott rewards points . We didn ' t expect much but it actually turned out great .

Above Average Hotel Stayed for three nights in June 2005 . Slightly overrated . While the rooms were clean and modern ( plasma t . v . , purified water in the bathroom ) , they are very small . Hotel guests are mostly white Americans , not that that is a bad thing but being in the hotel , you would never know you were in China ( except for the staff ) . Great location , excellent service , clean / modern facilities , good Western - style restuarant for buffet breakfast , luxury shopping within the hotel .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Above Average'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'Slightly overrated'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'modern'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'very small'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['facilities', 'facilities cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['facilities', 'facilities design_features', 'positive', 'modern'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'good'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['luxury shopping', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'within the hotel']]
Nice Hotel Nice hotel to stay while on a girls getaway . Located just outside the French Quarter . It was a clean hotel , nicely decorated , however the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small , so if your traveling with 4 - 5 women you may want a larger room . It was about a 10 minute walk from the Quarter , which is not bad , but it was a bit scary at 2 in the morning . Quaint bar . For the great rate they charge it is worth staying .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['Hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'nicely decorated'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small'], ['bathrooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small'], ['bar', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'Quaint'], ['Hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great rate'], ['Hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '10 minute walk from the Quarter'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'worth staying'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'Located just outside the French Quarter'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice']]

Good budget hotel I thought this was a good hotel for the money . It ' s clean , the staff were helpful and it is very centrally located . I loved having a fridge in the room cause I stocked that with some wonderful ham and cheese shortly after my arrival .

Double Charged ! While the hotel itself was nice , I was deeply troubled when the Hotel billed me twice for the 2 night stay . The nightly room rate was something like $ 290 and i paid $ 749 . 69 upon checking out . I was shocked therefore to find a separate charge to my Credit Card by the Arctic Club Hotel for an additional $ 658 . 28 ! !

Excellent location This hotel had an excellent location , near Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas . It was also convenient to get to / from the airport with the aerobus stopping at Plaza Catalunya . The rooms were very nicely furnished and quiet and you are greeted with a glass of cava upon arrival . The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful .

Warm memories of Hotel David We had a very nice stay for Christmas 2008 at the Hotel David in Florence , Italy . The staff ' s hospitality , the warmth of the hotel all decorated for Christmas , the happy hour next to the fireplace , the spacious clean rooms and wonderful freshly baked pastries for breakfast and Christmas Eve , all contributed to a very memorable visit to Florence .

Superb Hotel Stayed for 4 nights April 8 - 12th . Great staff - room was immaculate and more importantly , the bathroom was very clean .

A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in ! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted . Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station , bus and tram stops etc . One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution , we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'really nice'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'spotless'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'not be faulted'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station , bus and tram stops'], ['hotel', 'service general', 'positive', 'upgraded to a harbour view'], ['swimming pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes']]
Helpful staff and warm atmosphere My daughter and I stayed just one night at The Chesterfield and took advantage of the promotion found on the hotel ' s website that included a full breakfast . The hotel was warm , clean , safe and very British . Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as hot offerings from the kitchen ; a real treat . Though not the least expensive room in the city , for about $ 200 , it was , for two of us , worth every penny . Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring .####[['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Helpful'], ['The Chesterfield', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'warm atmosphere'], ['The Chesterfield', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'warm'], ['The Chesterfield', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['The Chesterfield', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'safe and very British'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'huge'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'neutral', 'not the least expensive'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'included'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'real treat']]
Good Service but Loud The location is quite convienent with many good restaurants in the neighborhood . The staff was very friendly and very helpful .

Good value weekend break When we stayed , they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money . We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel . Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times .

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel , or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service , a very modern and up to date decor , large and comfortable rooms , all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops . The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11 . 00am just in case we ' d had a late night , a sun terrace on the roof with a ( small ) pool and gymnasium , although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife . Its great value for money and if you are looking for a safe bet , with good service and a convenient location look no further####[['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'very modern and up to date decor'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great value for money'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'good'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'gave us everything'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Difficult to find fault'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not the largest'], ['Barcelona Universal', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'efficient'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive', 'ran till 11 . 00am'], ['pool', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['gymnasium', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient']]
One of the Best Hotels in Asia We have traveled all over asia , and not many of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at were as nice , attentive , and beautiful as this one . The concierge was very helpful , room service wasn ' t extremely overpriced , and the front desk staff was excellent . The room was BEAUTIFUL , it had the best furnishings out of any room I have ever stayed at . We were staying in the basic room for 107 a night , and were amazed . Vaulted ceilings , dark contrasting colored furnishings , beautiful lobby , GREAT location for tourists .

Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel , three great pools to choose from . My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials , we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade , 75 $ resort credit ,  complimentary bottle of wine . I would recommend a little restaurant right down the street called Hacienda , we got breakfast there almost every morning for like 7 bucks a person it was really good food with an excellent view !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Definately Recommend'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nicely renovated'], ['pools', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'great'], ['bottle of wine', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'complimentary']]

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton - family properties , and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay , it was hardly worth the price paid . Good points : very friendly staff , and terrific restaurantBad points : the room was dated - old rundown furniture , warped bathtub , stained bedding . I was only offered a double - queen suite in the main building , which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements .

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment , but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes , and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes , which improved the whole situation . The hotel is really quite plush , the rooms had everything we needed , and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free ! The staff were very helpful , and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go . The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others , but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day , and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water , wasn ' t to be turned down . It is definitely a hotel I would visit again , particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Fine'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'run down area of Barcelona'], ['rooms', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'had everything we needed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'neutral', 'discontent'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'visit again'], ['rooms', 'room_amenities prices', 'positive', 'soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'bit of a disappointment'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'walk to the sea in 10 minutes'], ['Hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'really quite plush'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'knowledgeable']]

Nice Hotel Stayed here last year . It was a very nice hotel in a good location . 10min walk to the centre . Very nice rooms however did not particularly enjoy Barcelona that much . If you do decide to go then you should consider staying here .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'good location'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'Very nice'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'consider staying here']]
Great City Centre Hotel Having just had a 3 night stay at the Park Plaza I can ' t understand why it gets such bad reviews . It is a typical city centre hotel and everyone should bear in mind that it is 80 years old and so doesn ' t have the modern look of some of the newer hotels in Boston . The staff were always happy to help , the room we had was large , very clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location for seeing all Boston has to offer . I would most definitely book here again .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'City Centre'], ['Hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', "doesn ' t have the modern look"], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'always happy to help'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'great location']]
Great hotel and Anthony is hot : ) The hotel is beautiful and the weather was great ! I was wondering where I was going to stay and leery on which place to choose ( being from the East Coast , we are all leery and question EVERYTHING ) . Best value in Hollywood , however , extremely dissapointed in the parking fees . Corey , can you ever wave that fee ? Geesh . Also , if Anthony is a ' friend of Dorothy ' or is Family , I ' d date him in a minute ! : ) Thanks again !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'beautiful'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Best value'], ['parking fees', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'extremely dissapointed']]

Heavenly hotel An oasis of calm and luxury in the heart of bustling Mong Kok . We stayed on the Club L floor which aside from having a gorgeous room with a great view of the city it meant we had a special personal check - in in Club L where there is a free internet den , massage chairs and unlimited food , drink , breakfast , afternoon tea for Club L guests . The whole hotel smells of gingerflower which was lovely and is connected to a huge shopping centre with loads of nice shops , restaurants , coffee shops , supermarket , cinema . . . basically they make it hard for you to want to leave the building .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Heavenly'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'gorgeous'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'great view of the city'], ['internet', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['food , drink , breakfast , afternoon tea', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'unlimited'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'smells of gingerflower'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Very comfortable beds ; colourful and clean Great little hotel - a 50s motel that has been turned into a very pleasant hotel . The room was very clean and the bathroom , although small was nicely decorated and also clean . Beds very comfortable and good aircon ( if needed ) . The pool is not large but perfectly adeqhate for a refreshing dip after a long 10 hour flight from the UK ! Breakfast was fresh pastries and bagels etc with coffee , juice and fresh fruit - eaten near the pool or back in rooms . Nice relaxed area and we walked to Fisherman ' s Wharf via a park and along the side of the bay - you can also take a bus from nearby . I certainly would recommend this hotel .####[['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'Very comfortable'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'colourful'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'neutral', 'small'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'nicely decorated'], ['bathroom', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['room', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'good aircon'], ['pool', 'facilities design_features', 'positive', 'not large but perfectly adeqhate'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'recommend this']]

Great , eccentric but click hotel I read one of the below reviews expecting the dylan to be past its prime after the changeover from ANoushka Hempel , shabby rooms , etc but was very pleasantly surprised . I went to amsterdam , a city i love and have visited many times for work and for pleasure , with a new partner - we were really surprised by the polite and professional ( not at all snobby ) service , great room service , great cocktails in the bar , and best of all , a great room . Booked a cheap ( 鈧 ? 30 ) rate off the internet and was expecting a broom closet , but the room was very nice , large ( by Amsterdam standards ) , loads of character , clean , kept - up - looking , just very very cool . I ' d not hesitate to recommend the dylan especially as there are not too many options in AMsterdam for characterful , stylish hotels .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'eccentric'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'polite and professional'], ['room service', 'service general', 'positive', 'great'], ['cocktails', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'great'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'loads of character'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'not hesitate to recommend']]

Friendly , quirky and great location Rooms are nice but small . If you are a couple with a lot of luggage , you will be wondering where to put it with just 2 drawers and a narrow wardrobe in our Queen room . That said the staff were always friendly and helpful . The quirky object in the mini bar cupboard gave me an hilarious taking point at the conference I was attending at the Westin nearby .

Great hotel and great staff I stayed at this hotel this weekend and was really pleased I chose the hotel . The staff were all very friendly and helpful , all the staff could speak English ( and were happy to ) , the location was perfect and the room was exceptionally quiet considering it was on a main road . The only down side to the hoetl was the size of the room . We stayed in a standard room and even though it was big enough for us it would have been nicer to have a slightly larger room . I would certainly return to this hotel if I return to Paris , the staff certainly and location certainly made a difference .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very friendly and helpful'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'could speak English'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'exceptionally quiet'], ['size of the room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
Perfect spot to enjoy Paris in the spring Nicely renovated hotel in a prime location right by the Eiffel , with bars , restaurants and shops all just seconds away . Staff are superb and very helpful , and pour a generous glass of vin blanc - perfect at the end of a busy day sightseeing . Rooms are small but very comfortable and bright with all amenities you need . We only had two days but the location meant we could easily see everything on our hotlist . I would definitely return if staying in Paris again .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Perfect spot'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nicely renovated'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'prime location'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'superb and very helpful'], ['Rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['Rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['Rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'bright'], ['Rooms', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'with all amenities']]
xcellent stay Book this hotel back in August for a November stay , someone at the marriott hotel website made a mistake and had the web price for a two bedroom lakeview suite at $ 29 . 00 instead of $ 229 . I jumped on it and booked it and thought I might get a hassle over it but instead the front desk staff were impressed at the rate I had recieved and happily checked me in . The staff were very friendly and the shuttle driver was excellent taking us to the downtown area whenever we needed him , of course a tip seemed to help with that . The hotel itself was clean and comfortable with a extended buffet breakfast . I would stay here again when in the area .####[['marriott', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'xcellent stay'], ['front desk staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very friendly'], ['shuttle driver', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['buffet breakfast', 'food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Disappointing A business type hotel close to Sants station , convenient for access to the airport and the metro station for Barcelona ' s tourist spots . The rooms were spacious , clean and well kept . For breakfast there was a wide choice of food available but the organisation was dreadful and on the Saturday it descended into the farcical with guests queueing for upwards of 30 mins to get into the dining area . One further point , check your credit card bill carefully I found 40 + euros were charged to my credit card after we had checked out .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Disappointing'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient for access'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spacious'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'well kept'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'wide choice of food available'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Paper thin walls stayed at the stamford on sat 19 . 4 . 08 after dropping brother at airport , reception was friendly enough but room seems dated even after reno ' s and beds are hard and pillows terrible . the worst thing was the noise from the adjoining room which started at 12 at night till at least 3am rang reception and asked if they could do something about it which involved knocking on the door and being told by guests next door to [ - - ] off and then giving up , was offered another room but as my 1 year old daughter had just gone to sleep after 2 hours of being kept awake by the noise i couldn ' t see the point i asked again for them to do something about the noise and the rang them and no change i rang again at 3 in the morning to be told there was nothing they could do about it and to see the duty manager in the morning . next morning at check out after no sleep i asked for the duty manager and told him my concerns , his reply was to offer free parking at a value of 10 dollars , i laughed as i thought he was joking after paying good money for no sleep he said the best he could offer was 2 free breakfast in there restaraunt which is about what soggy cold bacon and sloppy eggs are worth . for anyone wanting to stay at a decent hotel at the airport pick the holiday inn at least you might get a nights sleep .####[['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'Paper thin walls'], ['reception', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'dated'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'hard'], ['pillows', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'terrible'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]

great location Although it has been a few years since we visited this hotel , i would definately reccommend it as a no frills but clean , friendly , and centrally located hotel , if you are on a budget .

Why go to Venice when you have Amsterdam The Ambassade is located on one of the most scenic and quiet canals in Amsterdam .

The 5 stars are justified by the quality of the bed , the size of the room , the choice of restaurants , the excellent noise protection , the impressive size of the lobby and the bar . The spa on the top floor is great : very clean , extremely friendly staff ( like in the rest of the hotel ) . Noteworthy : it is the only really centrally located 5 - star hotel in Frankfurt . Breakfast is OK , nothing very special for the high price it is .####[['hotel', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'Perfect 5 - star'], ['bed', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'quality'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'excellent noise protection'], ['spa', 'facilities cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely friendly'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'centrally located'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'neutral', 'OK'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'high price']]

Bargain and convenient location For years , I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only . The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room . The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front . if , like me , you juts need a place to sleep and shower , the beds could be better but the water has always been hot , and it is a bargain ! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here , but I am barely in the room , so why pay more ?

Don ' t arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor . I had a reservation for a room with a large bed . When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds . They did find a room with one large bed , in the smoking rooms , but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby . For 140 Euro , I expected a lot more .

Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers . the room was perfect , great space which is unusual for New York , beautiful view , excellent location . The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor . The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly . But the reception area is really nice .

harming ! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed . We had room # 11 , which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn , but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast . We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by . The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful .

Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming , so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there . The lobby is absolutely exquisite , and the staff were warm and welcoming . The rooms didn ' t quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side . However , the bathrooms were larger than most I ' ve seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean . I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a pricier hotel for a weekend stay in Boston , close to many opportunities for great shopping , entertainment , and activities .####[['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Lovely'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'grandiose'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'charming'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'thrilled'], ['lobby', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'absolutely exquisite'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'warm'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'welcoming'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'negative', "didn ' t quite measure up to my expectations"], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'smaller'], ['bathrooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'larger'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'decor was stylish'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely recommend'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'pricier'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to many opportunities for great shopping , entertainment , and activities']]

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days ( before going back to work  reality ) . We were in the first group to leave the ship , so we arrived at the hotel at 9 : 30am ! The staff couldn ' t have been friendlier . They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits , and we sunned at the beach  had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2 : 30pm . We especially enjoyed the following : our very large and comfortable tower room , uncrowded beach , health club facilities , and good restaurants within walking distance .

Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views .

When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it .

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month . Tastefully decorated , spacious and clean rooms , friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room ! The location is ideal as it is close to everything you could possibly want to do in the Big Apple and there really is no need to take cabs as the subway is minutes away . I highly recommend this hotel and can ' t wait to return next month .####[['Beacon', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'hard time faulting'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'Tastefully decorated'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spacious'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'FANTASTIC market right across the street'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideal'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to everything'], ['Beacon', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'subway is minutes away'], ['Beacon', 'hotel general', 'positive', "can ' t wait to return"]]
Lovely , peaceful hotel 2nd visit to Paris . First time we stayed at The Novotel which was too large  very businesslike . We really enjoyed the position of Hotel Bassano in a typical , quiet part of Paris - a much more romantic setting . The staff are very polite  willing to please . We found the room delightful  very comfortable ( it was much appreciated when we went out for the evening to find our bed had been turned back  chocolates left for us - a very nice touch ) . Definitely recommend .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Lovely'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'peaceful'], ['Hotel Bassano', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very polite  willing to please'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'delightful'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Definitely recommend']]
Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site , and the hotel lived up to expectations ! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help . We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children , but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around , so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room ! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food ! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again , having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Loved'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lived up to expectations'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Very very friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'couldnt do enough to help'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'safe'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lots of CCTV cameras around'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great adventure'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'great'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'loved'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely recommend'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'would stay again'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'NULL']]
Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington . The hotel is conveniently located ( about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro ) , the staff is friendly and accomodating , and the suites are comfortable and well laid out . The 32 ' ' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus . Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items ( eggs , omelets , etc ) and an evening cocktail reception , both of which are fantastic . The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro ( about a 5 - 10 minute ride ) .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'conveniently located'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'accomodating'], ['suites', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['suites', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'well laid out'], ["32 ' ' flat screen tv", 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'definate plus'], ['breakfast buffet', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['breakfast buffet', 'food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive', 'cooked to order items'], ['evening cocktail reception', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'few stops away on the Metro']]
Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel . The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying . The bedroom was small , but intimate with everything a girl would want . . . . voluminous pillows , the finest sheets , and a comforter that you wanted to wrap yourself in along side your bed mate .

Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels , so Laguna had to meet the expectations , and mostly it did . My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool . Service was mostly impeccable . My only 2 small grouses were that check - in was long and that it was difficult to find a sundeck chair by the pool . It would have helped if staff was on hand to help guests find available chairs .####[['Laguna', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Pretty good'], ['Laguna', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'meet the expectations'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'raised platform'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'balcony facing the pool'], ['Service', 'service general', 'positive', 'mostly impeccable'], ['Service', 'service general', 'negative', 'check - in was long'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'difficult to find a sundeck chair'], ['Service', 'service general', 'neutral', 'would have helped if staff was on hand to help']]
Welcoming and friendly staff , elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel . The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel , from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants . The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous , with antique brick walls and elaborate , lush curtains . My favorite part of the hotel ( besides the amazing staff ) , was the location . It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions ( the steamboat tours , downtown New Orleans , The French Quarter , etc ) .

ice hotel , but beware The front desk staff were very nice . The breakfast buffet was tasty . However , the bathroom faucet had a very loud and obnoxious jack - hammer noise whenever turned on .

Interesting comfortable base in Seattle Really enjoyed my time here . Interesting decor with unique touches everywhere .

Personally . . . They have an excellent personal service , I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included , because I had to pay 12 euros per head . Apart from that , I loved the room . Although it was on the 3rd floor it was a quiet room and the location is perfect for shoppers !

Melia bali - Honeymoon Just returned fro a 2 week stay at the melia and we have not a bad word to say about this fantastic hotel or this beauiful island .

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews . Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar , were helpful , friendly and entertaining . Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated . The view alone is worth the visit ! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I ' ve visited . Oh and the spa . . . if you can fit it in do so , the perfect end to a great island vacation .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'pleasantly surprised'], ['Dominic', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['Dominic', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['Dominic', 'service general', 'positive', 'entertaining'], ['Hiriam', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['Hiriam', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['Hiriam', 'service general', 'positive', 'entertaining'], ['Rodney', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['Rodney', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['Rodney', 'service general', 'positive', 'entertaining'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'little small'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'updated'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'view alone is worth the visit'], ['Restaurants', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'little pricey'], ['cocktails', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'little pricey'], ['spa', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'perfect end']]
Absolutely brilliant . . . Myself and my girlfriend stayed 3 nights at this hotel just recently . I can highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the brilliant city of Barcelona . It is a two minute walk to La Ramblas and only a little further to some of the main attractions ( such as Gaudi buildings ) . The staff were excellent , the breakfast was good and the room was perfect . If we go back to Barcelona , we won ' t stay anywhere else .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Absolutely brilliant'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'two minute walk to La Ramblas'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'little further to some of the main attractions'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'good'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', "won ' t stay anywhere else"]]

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights . Despite the other reviews which might scare you off , we found the staff friendly and very responsive , room was clean and in good shape , and only a few very minor issues . Whenever we called , someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less ( e . g . extra blankets and pillows ) . This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt . Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore . About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior - - - though there were plenty of grab bars .####[['Elizabeth', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Very acceptable'], ['Elizabeth', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very responsive'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'good shape'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'neutral', 'few very minor issues'], ['Elizabeth', 'location general', 'positive', 'conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt .

Great Resort , Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites , pools and golf , but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation . The suites at PHTC are roomy , clean , quiet and offer great views . We stayed 3 days at this resort and would definitely stay again , but would avoid the restaurants . The staff at the Resort are super helpful ( and this includes the restaurant staff ) , but the 3 different resataurants we ate at ( on property ) were mediocre at best .

Great Hotel , superb location Just returned from H10 Montcada , this is an excellent hotel in a great location in Barri Gothic one street away from La Ramblas . Yes the rooms are quite small but we had no problems and it does have a great bathroom . Only minor problem was with the room safe not opening one evening , this was rectified within 5 mnutes of informing reception . Got the aerobus from airport for 3 . 90 euro single , stops right outside the arrivals at airport , hotel is a 10 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya use via Laetana to walk down , its less crowded to walk with a trolley case .

Fabulous location The Hotel had been recommended by my sister and for a girl travelling on her own , it was fantastic . Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter ' s restaurant district , it was perfect to eat out and walk safely to hotel , even at night . Needed to close window at night tho ' cos can be noisy if you are an early to bed person . Breakfast was fabulous and lovely helpful staff . I felt very secure and like I was in a home away from home . Highly recommend it , especially if a female travelling alone , very secure yet allowed freedom to eat out at night in many places around it . R . R .

Great for special break We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough , the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it ' s free champagne ( Moet ) and high class food from 11 . 00 am till 10 . 00 pm .

Location the best in San Fransisco . . . . . . . We stayed at the holiday inn from 6 - 13 nov 2004 , the hotel is an average 3 star but the views from the hotel are second to none . If possible ask for a bay view room on a high floor , the views of the bay are breathtaking . The best thing about this hotel is the location , across the road from Portsmouth Square , the heart of Chinatown , a 5 minute walk to North Beach the Italian district and 15 minutes either direction walking to the shopping district of Civic Square and the tourist thoroughfare of Fisherman , s Wharf , definately 10 out of 10 for location . For breakfast i would reccomend the Garden Restaurant outside the hotel , on the left , as breakfast in the hotel is overpriced and poor , similaly if you need a camera film etc the hotel shop is way overpiced so walk across to Chinatown and get your goods in the shops there . We would stay here again but that is down to the location , the best in San Fransisco , rather than the hotel itself . . . . . . . . . . .####[['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'best in San Fransisco'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'overpriced'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'poor'], ['hotel shop', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'overpiced'], ['holiday inn', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'views from the hotel are second to none'], ['holiday inn', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'average 3 star']]
Nice but noisy Very mixed feelings about this hotel . Don ' t need to dwell on the positives ( look  feel , location , very friendly service ) as they ' re all pretty much covered in the previous reviews . . The big downside is noise . Both from outside the room ( the noise from the pool can continue late into the evening ) , and from the thunderous air conditioning unit which you have no choice but to use , given the heat and humidity of the N . O . summer . Notwithstanding this , I would probably stay here again .

l , Relaxing Modern Retreat This was our 2nd stay in as many years at Bravo Beach Hotel and once again it was a wonderful time . Thomas , the manager , and the rest of the staff are fantastic , the property is fabulous , and the two restaurants are excellent ! I love the sleek design of the rooms ( very caribbean modern ) , the intimate size of the hotel ( only 9 rooms ) , that almost every room has a view of the ocean , the ipod docks in the rooms , the 2 pools ( one with a bar where you mix your own drinks ! ) and the groovy music that plays on the property all day long . It ' s just a very cool , relaxing setting with no pretense . We love it and look forward to returning next year to BBH !####[['Bravo Beach Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Relaxing'], ['Bravo Beach Hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'Modern'], ['Bravo Beach Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'wonderful time'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Bravo Beach Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'fabulous'], ['restaurants', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'sleek design'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'intimate size'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'view of the ocean'], ['ipod docks', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

Fantastic value We were very pleased with this hotel - granted the rooms are not that smart and the decoration is a bit old but everything was very clean and comfortable the lobby , pool and staff are all lovely and the breakfast buffet was just amazing ( although quite expensive ! ) The free pool towels were very welcome and the housekeeping staff responded immediately when we had a problem with an overflowing cistern ! It is a good 20 minute walk from all the action but during the day walking along the beachfront to the art deco area is lovely . If you are averse to noise though make sure you ask for a room high up as the bar in the lobby is very noisy !####[['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Fantastic value'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very pleased'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'neutral', 'not that smart'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'neutral', 'decoration is a bit old'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'all lovely'], ['breakfast buffet', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'just amazing'], ['housekeeping staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['pool towels', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free']]

Excellent value for money We stayed in this hotel from 29th Dec to 1st January . The hotel is small and the staff are very friendly . The room we stayed in was larger than we expected and was extremely clean and comfortable . As other people have stated , the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy walking distance to other livelier areas of the city . It is also a short walk to the nearest metro station .

A great hotel ! This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service , and it is within walking distance of most attractions ( we timed our selves strolling to the Duomo and it took about 6 minutes ) . I know that many times the star ratings on travel websites do not have any basis in realiity , however , this time I completely agree with the rating on Expedia . com that it is four star hotel . The rooms were great , the breakfasts were very nice , and I loved that the shower products are from the famed nuns at the Perfumia Santa Maria Novella .

gotta love the gym Other reviews have covered the room , the food etc . I want to add that the hilton has the best health club I have come across on my business trips .

>Caveat on ' Ocean View ' Room We booked an ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower . There was a nice view of the harbor , but the only way you could actually see the ocean from our room would be to step out onto the balcony and lean over to see a small sliver of Pacific . I complained that this did not constitute an ocean view in my mind , but the hotel staff told me that is how the room is classified , and refused to move us .

Great hotel in a very convenient location I really enjoyed my stay at the Abba Sants hotel . It is very comfortable , modern hotel . It ' s location , a few minutes walk from the Sants train station , is very convenient for travelers who are visiting the city . The hotel staff was great about giving restaurant recommendations that locals actually go to . The only downside was that the rooms were uncomfortably warm and the only way to cool down was to open the window which unfortunately let in the noise from a very busy street .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'very convenient location'], ['Abba Sants hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['Abba Sants hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'modern'], ['hotel staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'uncomfortably warm']]

lovely , just what you need if you are looking to stay somewhere pleasant but not too posh then this place is in a great location and not badly priced . we asked for a room with a view over the canal and it had great large windows for us to look out of . brekkie was nice and the bar at the front of the hotel was a nice atmosphere .

ral location with friendly atmosphere . We stayed here early October and even though we had done our homework on location , were pleasantly pleased with the hotels location . In the heart of the city , just a few steps away from Chinatown and easy access to the two cable car lines or street cars , to give you quick tranportation to the main attraction areas . Ok there is street noise but then again you are in the centre of a city and the lift can be heard but not enough to disturb you .

The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit .

Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay . The location is amazing , literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla , a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don ' t walk around on your own it ' s fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night , just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys . The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing . We had a well equipped bathroom , a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed . The staff are very helpful too . If you ' re looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona then this is a great option .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great little'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great for my stay'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'amazing'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'extremely basic'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['bathroom', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'well equipped'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'budget hotel']]
Hotel De Gerstekorrel I stayed at the Hotel De Gerstekorrel on February 2006 . Decent accomodations . Nothing fancy , nothing too shabby .

Fairytale trip to the sky . What is not to like . We checked prices at several top rated hotels and this was the best deal for the money .

Decent , comfortable rooms Provides decent accomodation . If you are looking for a luxurious hotel with helpful staff , this most certainly is not the place .

Seattle ' s Best ! Arrived very late in the evening for a one night stay . Staff were very solicitous , and on par with the hotel ' s service standards , each request was met with of course . All staff were pleasant , rooms were comfortably furnished with the latest innovations in guest room design , baths were wonderful .

Problems with Website I have not stayed at the hotel , but did make an online reservation through the hotel ' s official website . This has proven impossible to cancel online . The hotels cancellation web - page is non - responsive and my hotel - issued booking number is too many digits to fit in the dialog box . I was especially concerned about this when I noted the other reviewer ' s comments on this site which indicates that he was charged even when he e - mailed his cancellation .

Great value , huge rooms This property isn ' t the nicest or the best location , but the rooms are huge and clean .

Nice little hotel in the middle of the big apple It a small hotel on the Manhattan side of the brooklyn bridge that is good for a business or pleasure traveler . Standard Hampton morning breakfast , helpful staff , but very small rooms , so if you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room , it might be cramped . Walking distance to most lower manhattan toruist sites , and the deli around the corner is very good .

a true oasis I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay , saying i thought the value vs . price was not worth it , that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be , but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments . i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn ' t have stayed at a finer hotel . the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous , beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff , to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks , to the invitation to join them for canap茅s and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles , robes and slippers laid out . it ' s a true oasis from the rush of central London . you won ' t regret it !####[['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'value vs . price was not worth it'], ['price', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'very comparable'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly and extremely knowledgeable'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
The Silla is fabulous and so reasonable Brilliant , quiet , family run , view over Arno , 5 mins walk from ponte vecchio - ask for room 23 or equivalent - aircond is whisper quiet but enough to mask traffic and partner ' s snoring . Recent refurbish is good though ensuite is small - who cares the shower works well . Lovely terrace for breakfast or drinks - minibar in room will take your duty free , but no tea making equipment ( only minus point ) .

Treat in Amsterdam I stayed at the Piet Hein with my boyfriend for 2 nights in March based on the user reviews posted on Trip Advisor and wasn ' t disappointed . This area of Amsterdam is great as it ' s out of the main hustle and bustle , near the museums and close enough to be able to hop on a tram and be in the heart of the action . The staff were friendly , polite and helpful and the place was clean as were the rooms - nice white linen and a bright , clean , modern bathroom . The hotel is also located right next to Vondel Park , great for strolling around and watching the locals run , jog and walk their dogs ( sometimes at the same time ! ) . I would definately go back here when next visiting Amsterdam .####[['Piet Hein', 'hotel general', 'positive', "wasn ' t disappointed"], ['Piet Hein', 'location general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'polite and helpful'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'modern']]
Spot On Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D ' Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss . Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother ' s 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb . Staff were very helpful with all travel , restaurant and river cruise bookings - as said location ideal , premises were very clean and would definitely recommend to any friends / family in the future .####[["Hotel D ' Albe", 'hotel general', 'positive', 'experience was superb'], ['Staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideal'], ['premises', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean']]
Nice place for limited budget My experience with this place was very positive . The room was small but clean and comfortable . The location is excellent , close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation ( 5 - 10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop ( 24 ) right in front of the hotel ) . For anyone who does not want to spend a fortune staying in London , I strongly recommend this place .####[['NULL', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Nice place for limited budget'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very positive'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'strongly recommend']]
Great find in a beautiful city Stayed at this gem of a place over the christmas weekend and really enjoyed it . The location was very good , in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy , and the tram links were frequent and convenient . After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I ' ve seen in Europe . The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch , and the Living Room reception area , with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks , was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons . .

Four star location , one star service The palomar is an elegant hotel with a good central downtown location . The restaurant is rated highly by a number of gourment magazines and rooms are pleasant if on the small side .

Rude and disorganized staff Arrived from a very long flight with my husband and 3 yr old toddler . The initial receptionist was very pleasant and checked us in without any problems as everything was in order with the room number already printed on the reservation slip at the front desk . After settling in and resting for about 2 hrs , we received a shock of our lives when someone tried to open the front door of our apartment but failed then we got a call from the front desk . The Manager ( some guy ) had the gull to ask us to move out to another room as the room is meant reserved for someone else and said the earlier staff that checked us in was new . So what if old or new staff , this is not the way to treat guests and not even an apology was given for their mistake !

Efficient , patient , friendly I stayed at the Savoy for a shopping weekend in Berlin and found it a superb elegant hotel . The lobby and the restaurant simply invite to sit down and relax .

Just like they said . . . The Jazz was just as I had expected it to be . The hotel was nice to look at , there was a rumble from the underground , the rooms were clean and looked as they did in pictures , and it truly is very close to La Ramblas . All in all , for a three - star hotel it was great - - certainly great value for the money .####[['The Jazz', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice to look at'], ['The Jazz', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'just as I had expected'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'looked as they did in pictures'], ['The Jazz', 'location general', 'positive', 'very close to La Ramblas'], ['The Jazz', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great'], ['The Jazz', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'great value for the money']]

Good Value and Location Spent 3 nights ( $ 110 per night ) at the Ilima in Dec 2005 . Very happy with the proximity to Waikiki Beach and the surrounding designer boutiques ( Gucci , Chanel , Prada , etc . ) and restaurants . This is not a 4 or 5 star establishment , but that is OK , since you are not paying prime $ $ $ . The rooms are outdated , but clean , comfortable , and roomy . We found the staff to be friendly .

Great Place to Destress . . . . . Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven . We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball . The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps ! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog ! The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic . We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy . All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre ( 5 / 8 minutes away )####[['Maya Ubud', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great Place to Destress'], ['Maya Ubud', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'absolute heaven'], ['Spa', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'situated in a great location'], ['facilities', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['Maya Ubud', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'amenities around the hotel were excellent'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Maya Ubud', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great place to stay'], ['Maya Ubud', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to main centre']]

Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews . Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath . Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place , a massive shopping centre but not cheap ! The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location . The hotel is next to the Shangri - la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri - la blocks the sun from the pool . Other than that the place is faultless .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Fantastic'], ['NULL', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed'], ['NULL', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'duck by the bath'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'Very central for business travellers'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'MTR station below the hotel'], ['swimming pool location', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'negative'], ['swimming pool location', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'Shangri - la blocks the sun from the pool'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'place is faultless']]

Efficient and well run OK it will not win prizes for personality but the rooms are a good size in a great location with comfortable beds - what more do you need ? A few tips breakfast is very expensive but if your happy to pay 22 euro each its a good spread but I would advise you to try some of the nearby cafes more BerlinI upgraded to one of the suites it was only a small addition to the price but well worth it and dont be put off by courtyard view rooms they are fine .####[['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Efficient'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'well run'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'will not win prizes for personality'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'good size'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'great'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'very expensive'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'good spread'], ['rooms', 'rooms prices', 'neutral', 'small addition to the price'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'well worth it'], ['courtyard view rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'fine']]

Will not stay here again ! While traveling down the PCH from Bellingham , WA to San Diego , CA we made reservations for and stayed at the Seattle Quality Inn  Suites .

However , when I requested a 2pm check - out ( we did not check - in until after 7pm ) as per the special services extended to Choice Privileges members , I was told the latest we could check - out was 1pm ; the room was small ; there was an accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes which fell down on me when I pulled them closed ; only one elevator worked and it was slow ; the complimentary in room coffee service was provide only for one person ; after showering , the bathtub took forever to drain ( over 8 minutes ) and left behind scum ; we had to walk through the indoor pool area to reach the breakfast room ; the business center computer was out of order ; and the sole desk clerk was so harried trying to do several tasks at once that several guests left after waiting too long for service .####[['Seattle Quality Inn  Suites', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Will not stay here again'], ['Seattle Quality Inn  Suites', 'location general', 'positive', 'within walking distance of the Space Needle'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'accumulation on dust on the top of the drapes'], ['elevator', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'only one'], ['elevator', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'slow'], ['room coffee service', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'provide only for one person'], ['bathtub', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'forever to drain'], ['business center computer', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'out of order'], ['service', 'service general', 'negative', 'waiting too long']]

Great place to stay Stopped for three days on the way to NZ , and enjoyed immensely . Room pretty good although can get a bit noisy outside , saying that my 5 year old slept perfectly . The reason for 5 is partly for location but mainly for the excellent staff , for example we arrived and I had lost the suitcase keys . the desk guy managed to find a saw and had freed up our possesions before I returned with ( superb ) coffees from opposite 7 - 11 . Nothing seems to be too much trouble .

Great anniversary night ! We were able to check in early ( probably as it was a slow day - the Saturday of a three day weekend ) and the desk clerk , when entering our Hilton rewards card number , found out it was our 32nd anniversary . She upgraded us to a fabulour corner room , facing the harbor and gave us complimentary access to the executive suite hospitality room . The staff were all very nice , from the bell man who gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do once we got there , to the desk clerk , to the health club attendant , to the shuttle bus drivers . Would stay there again in a heart beat ! Was only sad it was a one night stand at the end of our vacation !####[['desk clerk', 'service general', 'positive', 'able to check in early'], ['desk clerk', 'service general', 'positive', 'upgraded us'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'fabulour'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'facing the harbor'], ['executive suite hospitality room', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'complimentary access'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['bell man', 'service general', 'positive', 'gave us tips on how to get into Boston and what to do'], ['health club attendant', 'service general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['shuttle bus drivers', 'service general', 'positive', 'very nice'], ['Hilton', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'stay there again'], ['Hilton', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great']]

Obsessed with this hotel ! We got a great deal on Orbitz for this amazing hotel . The location is outstanding , smack between the Duomo and Piazza Signoria . We had a room facing the back , from which we could open our windows to overlook the picturesque Florentine rooftops and an overwhelming view of the Duomo itself ! Our room was huge ; comfortable and modern furniture , a very clean and beautiful bathroom ( maybe a tad on the small side ) but a separate sitting room with a sofa / twin bed and separate TV with its own amazing view .

Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar , a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique , 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris . In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy . A good room , clean and tidy and attentive staff .

It ' s All True ! We stayed here just one night during a week - long stay in the Chianti area , and the member raves are quite well deserved . The hotel is extremely well situated ; the owners / staff could not have been nicer or more patient and accommodating ; the rooms were immaculate , and ours was of quite decent size .

Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Vibe Hotel and I thought , for price and location , you can ' t beat it . They had just recently undergone a massive renovation and the rooms were modern and comfortable and included any amenity we could have asked for - - minus complimentary towels at the rooftop pool which was slightly annoying since we called down to housekeeping 3 times and were clearly ignored .

ice city shame about the hotel we stayed for 1 week in August 4 - 11th , 2008 , found hotel to be showing its age , Doormen and staff very polite and courteous . But as a show Hotel for Boston , I think it could do with some updating . As some people have said it is surrounded by some good buildings , such as Trinity church and the Library , but is overshadowed by the monster skyscraper of the Hancock tower . I will not recommend this hotel to my friends or family as I believe more modern hotels exist in the city .

Fantastic place for the price For the second time in the span of about four weeks I ' ll be visiting London on business . And for the second time I booked my hotel stay at the Parkcity .

'Fantastic Hotel ' Just returned fro a 3 night stay at the H10 Montcada hotel Barcelona with 7 Friends . Fantastic hotel , staff very helpfull and polite rooms spotless and central location superb , within walking distance of all attractions just a short walk down to the marina , the tour bus stops just up the street ( 鈧 ? 20 / person all day unlimited travel ) .

The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street . But found this small hotel , only 1 / 2 block off of Bourbon , to be a quiet jewel . With a good hotels amenities and a friendly and helpful staff , I found myself able to complete my buisness and enjoy some of the nightlife made famous by Bourbon Street . I highly recommend the Hotel Saint Marie for buisness or pleasure .####[['Hotel Saint Marie', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'quiet jewel'], ['Hotel Saint Marie', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['Hotel Saint Marie', 'location general', 'positive', '1 / 2 block off of Bourbon'], ['Hotel Saint Marie', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'quiet jewel'], ['amenities', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'good'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['Hotel Saint Marie', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend']]

Brilliant hotel I spent two nights at Calzaiuoli at the end of last month and can ' t fault it . It ' s location is superb and although I was worried it would be noisy because it ' s so central , we weren ' t disturbed all night . The breakfast is exactly what you expect and perfectly good with lots of hot , strong coffee . I ' ve stayed in a lot of hotels in Florence and this one is definitely up there with my favourite , the Antica Torre , but this one is definitely more affordable .

Not too bad Having stayed here a number of times in the past the hotel is beginning to show wear a bit . Staff were pleasant and helpful throughout which is always as I have found it . The room facilities are as you would expect and the rooms are quite spacious ( from a European point of view ) . I like this hotel because of it ' s proximity to the Central Rail Station where I can get into and out of the Airport quickly without relying on a taxi ( or other transport ) . Food is of a reasonably good standard for breakfast . The Restaurant is highly regarded for it ' s Dutch food .

Excellent service at a cost Good location on a side road of Orchard Road , but not necessarily the best location as Orchard Road is like Oxford St in London , busy and full of tourists . The service was amazing , using your name when you check in , giving you a butler etc . Rooms are excellent , well appointed and a descent size , pure luxury . Concierge and all the staff very helpful , however I did find the cost of drinks a little on the steep side , as was breakfast .

The Best Having stayed at 30 Hotels in the last 90 days it takes a lot to get me enthused about a hotel at the moment but the Mandarin Oriental certainly did . I had a Harbour View room for 3 nights and the standard of the room and more importantly the standard of the service were exceptional . The gym and spa area are stunning also . It is the only hotel Ive stayed at over the last 3 months that I am keen to go and stay at again as soon as possibl####[['Mandarin Oriental', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'enthused'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'Harbour View'], ['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'exceptional'], ['gym', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'stunning'], ['spa area', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'stunning'], ['Mandarin Oriental', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'keen to go and stay at again']]

great location , design hotel A lovely modern hotel in a great location , on a wide , very smart shopping boulevard in the centre . Also about 30 seconds from the ( underground ) train station to the airport ( 25 mins ) .

Loved it ! The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful property located close to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City . It ' s located a floor or two above a large shopping center ( handy as there are banks , drugstores and quick / cheap places to eat ) . We stayed on the club level which meant check in was in our room ( nice touch ) , we had a separate concierge ( albeit not speaking english as well as those in the lobby ) and a delicious free breakfast and afternoon drinks .

Good value for New York Stayed for 6 nights from the 9th January . Had to wait till 4pm for room ( official check in time 3pm ) The offer of a complimentary drink or pot of tea would have been nice but not offered .

Discreet Charms Of The Neri On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren ' t disappointed . It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity . Having travelled extensively , far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use . The Neri , in common with good hotels , simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed , excellent assistance from the helpful staff , and a wonderful location for sightseeing . The hotel deserves to succeed .####[['The Neri', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Discreet Charms'], ['The Neri', 'hotel general', 'positive', "weren ' t disappointed"], ['The Neri', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['The Neri', 'hotel design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['The Neri', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'emphasis on quality'], ['accomodation', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['accomodation', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'good nights sleep is guaranteed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent assistance'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['The Neri', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'deserves to succeed']]

Good room and location We only had one night in Florence , so I chose this place for its good proximity to tourist sites and train station and based on the excellent reviews it received here . he hotel was easy to find , and our room turned out to be quite nice .

Good hotel - good location Stayed at Principal 5 days in november - in a big room in the not renewed section . Second floor with a nice balcony to the street . We think this hotel gives value for money - and is above average in its class . It has a friendly , professional staff in every function important to guests : reception , breakfast and cleaning . We appreciated very much living close to the Gothic Quarter - and Rambla .

ice Airport Hotel Very nice overnight stay at the Steigenberger . I was in the Executive Tower , with a very nice room , comfortable bed and great shower . Breakfast was about average for a hotel like this . he free shuttle to Frankfurt Airport runs 24 hrs a day and takes less than 10 minutes , making it easy to get on the S - Bahn to go to either downtown Mainz or Frankfurt or a variety of other locations . his is definitly a good value for an airport hotel .

oved the hotel , staff and location he airport bus ( 1 stop from the airport ) dropped us close to the hotel ( 400m ) from Placa d Espanya , situated on a very quiet back street but close to two metro stations ( the best way to get around ) . Upon arrival we had to get the paperwork out to check that there had not been a mistake on the price as it far exceeded our expectations . We used a three day metro ticket to travel around , it was so easy , and the hotel gave us advice and a map . We were very close to the Magic Fountains , the tourist bus stops and Crue Coberta shopping street . he only negative was the lack of places to eat and drink but we did find an Asian restaurant with no English spoken and had a great buffet meal , better that we had in the port at a fraction of the price as it was where the locals ate , 50m from the hotel . he room was great with a large bed , a decent bathroom and a cheap mini - bar .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'oved'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'oved'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'close'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'easy'], ['location', 'location general', 'negative', 'negative'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'decent'], ['mini - bar', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'cheap']]

>Watch out for the Extras I stayed at the Four Season Mexico City on a Wednesday in late Febuary . verall the service was excellent and the lobby and courtyard areas are attractive . My room had two huge flat screen TVs and a view of Reforma but beyond that the furniture was nothing special for a hotel of this caliber . Also , while I expect to pay more for room service , internet access , and hotel cars in a more expense hotel like the Four Seasons , the prices seemed a bit excessive : $ 50 for a room service dinner of one beer , one bowl of soup , and a sandwich and $ 25 for wireless internet access .####[['service', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['Four Season Mexico City', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'attractive'], ['flat screen TVs', 'room_amenities design_features', 'positive', 'huge'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'nothing special'], ['one beer , one bowl of soup , and a sandwich', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'bit excessive'], ['room service , internet access , and hotel cars', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'more expense'], ['wireless internet access', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'NULL']]

smelly rooms , no hot choc but cool view ! good value but a bit crap if you consider the smelly smokey rooms and the suspicious showers . he view from the room window is lovely though , over the Amstel , very romantic sunsets and sunrise . . . for breakfast , there ' s either coffee or tea only , personnally i need some creamy hot chocolate to start the day but there were none available , only as an extra , so i had to pay 5 euros extra on the 7euros all - inclusive buffet breakfast ! ! !

ocation Location Location We stayed the night of the 18th May at the hotel in a dbl upgraded room , although as the previous correspondent said , it didnt have a walk in shower , but the bathroom was lovely nonetheless . A very nice hotel , attentive staff - but expensive drinks . However , when you balance that with a very competitive 拢20 . 00 3 course price fixe menu it balances out . Breakfasts are also quite expensive , but we chose to eat a 100 meteres up the road at Marios , all inclusive for around a fiver , and very nice - allbeit not as grand as the Sofitel .

As Per Great Reviews I booked this hotel on the basis of the consistantly good reviews given to it via Trip Advisor . The best thing about the hotel is the honesty and integrity of the staff which I have found lacking in some Venetian Hotels . I suppose this is understandable with the huge number of tourists there . It was very clean , quiet , the staff appear to enjoy their job and your presence and very good value for money .

After renting a car and heading out on a road trip of northern spain decided to book our last night here as well .

Super customer service My husband and myself have just come back from a trip to Asia where we also stayed at the Ritz Carlton . The hotel was exactly what we had expected and fully lived up to its name . The most exceptional points were the customer staff the person that met us Ms . Lynett , professional , kind and extreamly helpful . We really apprected the beautiful though of the Chocolate cake sent to our room courtesy of the hotel for our anniversary .

Best Hotel in NYC My husband and I stayed at the Bryant Park Hotel for a weekend getaway . We have stayed at numerous properties throughout the city and was pleasantly suprised at this hotel . From the moment we checked in , the staff was very accomodating and nice . We were upgraded and the room was very impressive . We will be staying at this hotel in the near future and want to pass on this experience to anyone looking to stay in NY . The hotel was in an excellent location and the park was my favorite spot to sit and have coffee in the mornings .####[['the Bryant Park Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Best'], ['the Bryant Park Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'pleasantly suprised'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very accomodating'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'upgraded'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very impressive'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['the Bryant Park Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'staying at this hotel in the near future'], ['park', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'my favorite spot to sit']]
Great hotel in a Great Location Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in early August . The hotel staff was very helpful , the rooms were clean and although I do not speak any french , I had no problems at all . Very convienant to the Eiffel Tower ( 5 min walk ) .

Smart Hotel , good location The hotel is in both a quiet and central location ; 2 steps from the Vondelpark and 2 minutes from Leidersplein . The public areas are smart and modern and the rooms functional , clean but a bit small . We travelled with a baby and though a very clean and comfortable cot was waiting for him in our room , the lack of space and facilities like a kettle made things a bit difficult . The staff were all helpful and friendly and overall I would recommend it as a good city hotel , but perhaps more suited to singles / couples than families .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Smart'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'good'], ['Hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'quiet'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', '2 steps from the Vondelpark and 2 minutes from Leidersplein'], ['public areas', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'smart'], ['public areas', 'facilities design_features', 'positive', 'modern'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'functional'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small '], ['cot', 'room_amenities cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['cot', 'room_amenities comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'lack of space'], ['kettle', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'made things a bit difficult'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'all helpful and friendly'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'recommend'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'more suited to singles / couples']]
What a gem We stayed at this hotel for eight nights in July and it met all our needs and more . Friends told us that hotel rooms in Paris are small so we booked a Millenium room which is larger .

Great locale and Service , a bit tattered Stayed here two nights in april visiting family etc . What the hotel may lack in modern it makes up for in fabulous staff , free sodas and chips , wonderful continental breakfast with home made baked goods , and spacious rooms .

Great place to stay ! My husband and I had been to New Orleans on two previous occasions - for the French Quarter Festival and for Mardi Gras just prior to Katrina . Even with remodeling going on , our stay at the Bienville House was wonderful ! Our room was large , decorated with period furnishings / antiques and the bed was the most comfortable we have had at any hotel . The hotel was just as the pictures on the websites showed , the staff was friendly and helpful and even though the Heritage Cafe and Gamay Bistro were not open as the websites said , we had a wonderful stay at the Bienville House .

Nice the Paris hotel in Florence is much more than a nice and particular hotel ! We booked the Paris Hotel in Florence through our Travel Agency which suggested it as a very nice and particular hotel : the Paris hotel is much more than a nice and particular hotel ! Breakfast room is unique with its frescoes of the XVI century as the atmosphere in every part of the hotel . What a pleasure to sit and relax in this room having your breakfast with such a large choice of products among which ones also some Tuscany specialties . . . Our room had a very high ceiling with nice decorations , the ancient furniture was very elegant , bathroom was comfortable enough and very clean . Moreover this hotel is placed in a very good location : from there you can reach easily everything in a few minutes on foot .

Horrific I had booked a room for 3 days this past February , and after reading some of the reviews here , I cancelled it . Thank goodness because when I saw it as I drove by on the highway , it looked pretty terrible . I should have been better about writing down all of the cancellation info , because a month later , they charged me for the room I didn ' t even stay in , and refuse to refund my money .

Hidden paradise in middle of the city When I make the reservation for this hotel I have no idea of the hidden paradise that I found in the middle of the city .

Preferred Business Address  Nice amenities , but since I came here on business , I needed an internet connection in my room . That service was sorely lacking . Not only that , the connections only worked in the lobby where people had to jockey for position to use them . This may sound insignificant , but for a hotel that bills itself as a preferred business address and has no internet and no business center , this hotel gets a big fat zero . Not only that , but the management seemed to not care less when i voiced my concerns . at the very least , i should ' ve been comped for my use of the cyber cafe a few blocks away####[['amenities', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['internet connection', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'service was sorely lacking'], ['lobby', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'connections only worked']]

New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors . No regret at all contrarely the best price / quality / service i had since i travel to HK ( 12 years for business ) . Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner ( if you want ) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality . Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting , just and just more than what you need , all perfectly well organized and controlled . Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong . Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities .####[['Hotel', 'hotel quality', 'positive', 'New safe Quality'], ['Boardroom', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'just and just more than what you need'], ['Langham', 'service general', 'positive', 'all perfectly well organized']]

Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July . Rooms ok , clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes . We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room . Fridge and micro stuffed into the room , no place to eat except in bed . Similar to another review , we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners , demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia , and it was also not the place for asking questions . Location ok , a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we ' re used to walking .####[['motel', 'hotel general', 'neutral', 'Not more than ok'], ['Rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'ok'], ['Rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['wardrobe', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['Rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'hardly found space'], ['Fridge and micro', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'stuffed'], ['Rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'no place to eat except in bed'], ['owners', 'service general', 'negative', 'also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude'], ['owners', 'service general', 'negative', 'demanding our credit card for security'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ok'], ['Location', 'location general', 'neutral', 'bit far down on Lombard Street']]
lean and good location but aimed at gay community . The staff were friendly and helpful . The room was comfortable but small . We believe they cater for a gay market , whilst this does not bother us at all , we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element . We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way .

Superb hotel We went to Berlin for the Xmas markets and decided to stay at this hotel because of the very good feedback reviews on tripadvisor . For the money , it is one of the best European hotels that we have stayed in - we were surprised at how large the rooms were . It is also ideally situated and in very quiet street . The only downside was that breakfast in the hotel was not included in the price but we found a small cafe just around the corner where we could purchase rolls , sandwiches , croissants etc at a fraction of the price that the breakfast in the hotel would have cost . Thoroughly recommended - you won ' t be disappointed .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Superb'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'one of the best European'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'also ideally situated and in very quiet street'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'negative', 'not included in the price'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Thoroughly recommended']]
Excellent service I stayed at the Radisson as one of a group of 40 that travelled to Boston for the St . Patricks day parade . I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant . The hotel facillities are really good , including on site swimming pool , rooms are above average size , excellent beds , spotlessly clean , restaurant is well above average and hotel is very centrally located and convienient to airport ( 12 mins by cab ) The reservations dept were extremely helpful throughout and were not in the least fazed by the inevitable changes to bookings that is inherrent in a large group .

Just the job Nice little hotel this , right on top of shopping , the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot . Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace .

Ideal For Long Weekend First impressions of the hotel were excellent . We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff who were keen to ensure that our stay in the hotel and Barcelona was as pleasant as possible . Our room was large , if basic , with a good standard of cleanliness . Due to the tiled floors the noise from corridors did tend to echo in our room however , this was not a particular problem that would put us off returning to the hotel in the future .

Sufficient I wouldn ' t necessarily go back to the Hostal R . Capitol , as I found it a bit old and crumbly for my taste , but it has a couple of redeeming qualities : First , it is located right on the Ramblas , and there ' s hardly a more perfect location for those who enjoy bustling activity in their immediate environs . Second , I was extremely grateful that I was able to book the room shortly before 10 : 30 on a Friday night , arrive about an hour later . . . and check out around 5 : 30 the following morning . The helpful gentleman at the front desk , on duty all night long , was undaunted by the unusual ( but , in my case , necessary ) hours . In short , this would not be my first choice for Barcelona accomodations , but if you need an inexpensive room in a pinch , Hostal R . Capitol suffices .####[['Hostal R .

Great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here over New Year for 3 nights and it is one of the best hotels we have stopped in . The service and attention to detail is amazing .

So comfortable ! 15th July , 2006This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service , lovely staff and beautiful rooms . Right in front of Kensington Gardens , you have plenty of shops , pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End . Every room I have seen ( total of 5 ) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk .

Loved Raco Del Pi and Barcelona Just returned from a three night stay at the Raco Del Pi with my family . Rooms although not very large were spotless .

Great Location , Great Value Great location right behind the Cathedral . Friendly staff . Large rooms , and the restaurant serves AWESOME chocolate flan ! !

Be Warned : Polyester Sheets First of all , this place is really really cheap , so I feel a little bad complaining , also the staff were genuinely concerned when i brought this matter to their attention , however , the sheets here are some kind of polyester blend , so even though it may be freezing cold outside , you will not need to turn on the heat , you will sweat up a storm and wake up wet . I didn ' t sleep too well once i realized i was sleeping on a mattress that must be drenched with the sweat of a thousand previous guests . i would not stay here again , even with it being cheap .####[['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'genuinely concerned'], ['NULL', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'really really cheap'], ['NULL', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', "didn ' t sleep too well"], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not stay here again']]
Q We booked a four - night airfare / hotel package with Expedia , choosing the QC because of the mostly positive reviewson TripAdvisor . com , which turned out to be accurate . TheQ C will not knock your socks off , but it covers the basicbases handily : with a pleasant , clean room and a few pleasing extras like Bath and Body Works toiletries , a second magnifying mirror in the bathroom , etc . Nice bathroom with great water pressure . One drawback : we were put in the second building next door on Camp Street , and the room had permanently - sealed windows of frosted , pebbled glass - - gave kind of a claustrophobic effect .####[['TheQ C', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'covers the basicbases handily'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'pleasant'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['toiletries', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'few pleasing extras'], ['mirror', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'magnifying'], ['bathroom', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['bathroom', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'great water pressure'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'permanently - sealed windows of frosted'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'gave kind of a claustrophobic effect']]

fabulous ! We arrived at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne with high expectations , which could have really set us up for a disappointment . Fortunately , we were even more impressed than we thought we would be . The staff was very helpful , always smiling , and the room was wonderfully clean , with a distant view of the Sacre Coeur from the balcony ( on the fourth floor ) . It is close to the pyramides metro station , so it ' s easy to navigate the city from its location . I ' m not sure that I will choose a pricier hotel in Paris , because this hotel has so much to offer - - all the more reason to splurge on some fantastic French food !####[['Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'fabulous'], ['Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'even more impressed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'wonderfully clean'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'distant view of the Sacre Coeur'], ['Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to the pyramides metro station'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'easy to navigate the city'], ['French food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'not sure that I will choose a pricier']]
Think the HI is getting a bad rap I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of April . My room was spotless ( despite what some reviewers have written ) , and while the bathroom was small , the shower itself was roomy , the hotel bath linens of very good quality and a working iron and ironing board in the closet . The staff was very friendly , very helpful and willing to work with a little Spanglish if communication broke down . I , for one , like not being in a property facing Ashford ( it was much quieter ) and still less than a block from everything on Ashford . Breakfast every AM in a room facing the pool ( which only gets sun in the AM BTW ) was good with pastries , juice and coffee . All in all , more than I expected from a Holiday Inn at a reasonable prepurchase rate .####[['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'spotless'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['shower', 'room_amenities design_features', 'positive', 'roomy'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Breakfast every AM in a room'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'good with pastries , juice and coffee'], ['Holiday Inn', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'more than I expected'], ['Holiday Inn', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'reasonable prepurchase rate'], ['linens', 'room_amenities quality', 'positive', 'very good'], ['iron and ironing board', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'working']]
Beautiful and quiet The Library is a beautiful , clean , lovely hotel in a great location . The staff from arrival until we left 4 days later were attentive , knowledgable , and helpful . The rooms are numbered with the Dewey Decimal System and each room has a little theme ( ours was a the ancient language room ) and they are tastefully decorated to create a calm inviting setting . They have complementary breakfast , drinks and snacks through out the day , complimentary wine and cheese daily , a rooftop bar , streetlevel resturaunt , oncall doctor , free movie rentals , and are within walking distance to 5th Avenue shopping , Grand Central Station , and St .

More than adequate for its class We stayed in the Monna Lisa for 4 nights in early December and had a positive experience . This is not a luxury hotel , but given the price we had no complaints . The street is a quiet one and the location , near the Duomo and on the same street as La Giostra Restaurant is very convenient . Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant to deal with , graciously providing information and making reservations for us for dinners and tours .

Still my favourite - but . . . This is definately my favourite hotel in Paris ( considering my budget ) . Great location , friendly staff , surprising design features , nice rooms , clever lay out , but . . . we were lucky . Friends travelling with us stayed in the same hotel , at the same rate but didn ' t really get what we got . They walked into a really tiny and a little run down room , and the bathroom was very tiny and didn ' t ' feel ' clean . So picking this hotel is like playing the lottery .

Stay here ! This was a terrific hotel in all respects - - great location , fabulous service , and well appointed rooms ( we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely , very quiet and spacious ) .

Nice Place I satyed four nights at the hotel for a conference and found it to be a fine establishment . I was in a distant section that made access to the lobby and conference section quite a hike but was near to the spa and pool which proved to be an advantage .

The food was tasty and well presented and the location was very convenient for access to lots of transportation and local activities .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice Place'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'fine establishment'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'immense'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'tasty'], ['food', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'well presented'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very convenient']]

Great find - family hotel in the heart of New York City Found this hotel quite by accident and what a find . . . Location is just off times square - right in the middle of the action . Hotel is themed on North African theme and it completely works , the friendly attentitive staff actually seem to care about your well being and you don ' t feel as though you are a corporate number . In particular the free cheese and wine every evening helps to make you night out complete , they do this because they don ' t ( didn ' t ) have a liquor licence . breakfast is continental style - but again included in the price . The rooms are big ( for New York ) and a welcome change from the chain hotels - with fans as well as the usual AC . The only downside was leaving - great place .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'just off times square - right in the middle of the action'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly attentitive'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'themed on North African theme'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'actually seem to care about your well being'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'free cheese and wine every evening'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'continental style'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'again included in the price'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'big']]
Very good I ' m a bit surprised by the negative reviews on here - unless parts of the hotel are still being renovated . I stayed in the tower part which was very good - air conditioning was excellent which in Singapore is a must . The rooms are quite small ( the bathroom especially ) , but otherwise a decent place to stay for a few days . There was a regular free bus into town , and it ' s only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay ( about 30 mins to Orchard Road ) . Happily stay again , although as ever I do resent having to pay extra for the internet when you pay a fair whack for the room in the first place .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Very good'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'tower part which was very good'], ['air conditioning', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'quite small'], ['bathroom', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'quite small'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'only about 15 mins walk to Clarke Quay'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Happily stay again'], ['internet', 'room_amenities prices', 'negative', 'pay extra'], ['rooms', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'fair whack']]

an ' t wait to return to UMA Stayed at the UMA for 2 nights in a terrace room and emerged totally relaxed and recharged . Was lucky to catch the hotel in low season , place was utterly serene and prob only saw a handful of other guests around the entire time . Restaurant , poolbar and front desk staff were friendly and helpful . What I really appreciated : 5mins walk from Mozaic ( must be the best restaurant in Bali ) Pool is a good length could be 25metresFree transfers to town from morning to nightResort is lush and green with lots of plants  flowersComo shambhala toiletriesNo major issues with the hotel except that there were flies by the poolside , which makes it inconvenient if you want to leave your food / drink unguarded while you take a dip .####[['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'emerged totally relaxed and recharged'], ['UMA', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'utterly serene'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly and helpful'], ['UMA', 'location general', 'positive', '5mins walk from Mozaic'], ['Pool', 'facilities design_features', 'positive', 'good length'], ['UMA', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'Free transfers to town from morning to nigh'], ['UMA', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'lush and green with lots of plants'], ['Pool', 'facilities cleanliness', 'negative', 'there were flies'], ['Pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'inconvenient']]
Great Location My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our way back to the UK . Plus points - The hotel is in a great location on Union Square and the inside of the hotel looked very nice .

Terrific Location We stayed at this hotel on our first 4 nights in Australia . The view of Darling Harbour from the room was amazing . The hotel room was excellent in everyway .

pretty standard , good location Me and my wife stayed at Coral Princess Inn on November 2005 . The hotel has a very good location and the area is quiet and decent . We are not the type of people to whine about the change of sheets and spots on the walls , but there seemed to be a major problem with their air conditioning at the room we were staying in . We got that little room no 12 for 99 USD per night on the second floor . The temperature in the room was never under 32 degrees celcius and we found it hard to sleep sometimes .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'good'], ['Coral Princess Inn', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'pretty standard'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['Coral Princess Inn', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'area is quiet and decent'], ['air conditioning', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'major problem'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'little'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'negative', '99 USD per night on the second floor'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'never under 32 degrees celcius'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'hard to sleep sometimes'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'spots on the walls']]

Good hotel - but watch your wallet This hotel has character and is in an excellent location . The restaurant is very good - reasonable prices , huge menu , very popular . Only blip in our stay was having one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet and one 20 Euro note lifted from my wife ' s purse while we were at breakfast and the room was being cleaned . Obviously we shouldn ' t have left the money in the room , but my issue was with the attitude of the hotel who rather than express any concern simply refused to accept that it could possibly have been their cleaner and must have been an opportunist thief come in from the street . Quite a strange thief - goes up to the third floor of a small hotel , sneaks into a small room without the cleaner in the room seeing him and then takes one note from each of two purses / wallets , leaving loads of other notes behind and returning the purse and wallet to the pockets of clothes in the room . The hotel ( and cleaner ) were no doubt banking ( correctly ) that we wouldn ' t bother wasting half a day of a two day trip to Barcelona at the police station !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'watch your wallet'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['restaurant', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'reasonable prices'], ['restaurant', 'food_drinks style_options', 'positive', 'huge menu'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'one 50 euro note lifted from my wallet'], ['hotel', 'service general', 'negative', 'simply refused to accept']]

Great Hotel , no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels . The room ( 76 ) was elegant and clean , and the location was perfect .

Clean Room / Great Location / Excellent Price I was entirely satisfied with my stay at the Prince Conti . I was shocked to find a safe and clean room at a price as low as the Prince Conti ' s midweek rates .

Great Hotel , perfect location I ' ve just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice . The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower , i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for , to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out . As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent , i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her . As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep , although there are plenty of buses , cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy .

The beach is supurb ( Like the bounty advert ) lovely warm sea , very safe to wonder around , plenty of sun loungers , and parasoles for shade , the food is very good plenty of choice , breezes is a very clean and kept clean hotel the staff are very pleasent and very helpful , We would recommend taking a box of PG tips and a couple of bars of Cadburys and any other required pleasures , that can ' t be bought out there , you will be ripped off buying things in the hotel . The country side is very plush and green breath taking scenery and well worth taking an excursion out and experiencing the local culture .

5 star hotel with historic charm Stayed for one night and was really impressed .

Just Perfect ! ! ! This hotel was more than expected ! ! ! In the center , close to the bigest shops and to La Rambla , with very helpful staff , we booked the romatic package through their website and we had the breakfast included ( very good ) and a bottle of cava for free !

Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn ' t have picked a nicer spot . We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which , for us , encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit . We had a very ' Florentine ' room with a view ' and a great bed , the best of friendly attention from our hosts , a good breakfast and a super location . In the grim early - winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland , we think about our ' time out ' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return .

They won us over We weren ' t sure about this hotel at first - it needs a bit of TLC and a lick of paint in some areas , but the staff made it for us . We didn ' t see one rude member of staff - all were very friendly and helpful .

Loved it - would definatly stay again . We really liked this hotel . Good room , great restaurants nearby and good cocktails in the bar , not far from Old Street station .

very nice airport hotel Was very pleased with this hotel . Rooms are very large , well appoingted but with plenty of space for luggage etc . Breakfast was more than adequate , with made - to - order omelets , and the whole facility was immaculate and actually worked ! Only negatives we noted were shuttle service from LAX is on request which we didn ' t know and lost some time waiting curbside before calling , and if you rent a car or drive , note that hotel parking is $ 15 . 00 per nite .

Very Good Stayed here for business in Brooklyn , the location was great , just a block from where I was working . Overall a great hotel , well maintained and very clean ( especially when compared to previous experiences in ' upscale ' Manhattan hotels ) . Food was very good , and restaurant / bar staff friendly . My only issue was with the noise from the adjacent room that came through the connecting door . This seems to be a common problem with Marriotts , in my experience ( maybe with all hotels as well , but I stay almost exclusively at Marriotts . ) A fussy toddler kept me awake until 1 : 30AM , ugh .

Not bad Hotel was about 20 - 25 minute walk to the centre of Florence . The room was clean , with a good shower and the staff were friendly . The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests ' coming and going ' . It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep . Probably wouldn ' t stay here again for that reason .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Not bad'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '20 - 25 minute walk to the centre of Florence'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['shower', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'good'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'only downside were the banging of doors late at night'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'stopped a good nights slee'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', "Probably wouldn ' t stay here again"]]
wonderful hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the Argonaut - our second stay here . The hotel ' s location at the end of Fisherman ' s Wharf and almost next to Ghirardelli Square is just about perfect for vacationing travelers - very convenient , yet quiet . Service is excellent , beds are extremely comfortable , and rooms are well decorated and clean . The hotel ' s restaurant , Blue Mermaid , is very good ( although we liked Capurro ' s across the street better for breakfast ) . The bowls of fruit in the lobby and the wine hour in the afternoon are great added touches that make you feel good that you decided to stay there .####[['Argonaut', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very convenient'], ['location', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'quiet'], ['Service', 'service general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['beds', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'extremely comfortable'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'well decorated'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['Blue Mermaid', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['Argonaut', 'service general', 'positive', 'great added touches']]
uld be better Just got back from a week in Seattle and loved almost every minute of it . The Pacific Plaza , while a good buy , could use some improvement .

Also , while the room was non - smoking , the internal ventilation system seemed to draw in smoke from other rooms .

Great experience ! We stayed at this hotel for three nights in total . The first on our arrival in Phoenix prior to our driving tour round and were so impressed we reserved a room for the nights prior to flying back out of Phoenix to Holland . Everything was clean , the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful - from giving us milk at 2am to help us sleep as we were jet lagged to arranging the shuttle bus to take us to Mills avenue so we could go for a night on the town ! ! Having toured round for two weeks the amenities and service here were not beaten along our travels - high speed internet , breakfast , pool , spa , vending machines , fridge , microwave .

Fantastic Bang For the Buck I found the Holiday Inn Darling Harbour to be a bargain compared to other hotels in Sydney . The room was spacious , clean and comfortable .

A sanctuary amongst inferior hotels After a horrific experience at the LaFayette hotel down the street , my coworker and I went back to the familiar comfort of the Marriott . We were greeted by very friendly doormen and someone came and took our luggage that we had to carry up the street in the rain . In fact , they were so nice that when I tripped over a drain cover that was in the parking lot , the doorman immediately went and got a screwdriver and fastened the cover to the ground ! The desk workers were equally friendly and put us in a great room .

I ' d suggest requesting the newer tower ( there are two towers to the hotel ) when booking . Overall , a nice property , but not worth more than $ 160ish per night in my opinion . I ' d look around and see what else is out there , if the rate is exceeding $ 160ish .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great views'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'felt small'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'older'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice property'], ['Hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'not worth more than $ 160ish per night']]
Back again ! On our trip through Mexico we stayed three nights at the NH Hotel Mexico City . Everything was excellent : a very clean and calm room ( on the ninth floor ) , with all comfort you can imagine ( till toothbrushes , toothpaste , wax for shoes , . . . ) , the breakfast buffet was tremendous and the staff was friendly and competent ( spoke even french ! ) . We felt that in this hotel all is made so that the customer feelshimself well .

Pleasant Surprise This hotel was definitely a pleasant surprise . White the room was a bit small / tight , it was very well redone , with an absolutely awesome view of the beach . While it is a block from the beach , there ' s not much in between to kill the view . The lobby is OK - a bight tight , and the Mezz floor is low celienged ( very 1970 ' s ! ) , but the rest of the place is very nice , and well priced . Would definitely recommend it over most others in Waikiki - unless you really want to stay right on the beach and pay a lot more .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Pleasant Surprise'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely a pleasant surprise'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'bit small / tight'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very well redone'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'absolutely awesome view of the beach'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'block from the beach'], ['lobby', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'OK'], ['lobby', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'bight tight'], ['Mezz floor', 'facilities design_features', 'negative', 'low celienged'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'rest of the place is very nice'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'well priced'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely recommend']]
Great location , terrible rooms ! The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location . It is just around the corner from Nathan Street which is ideal for any shopaholics and there is an underground station a minute鈥檚 walk away from the hotel . The Kowloon Hotel is a very busy hotel which caters for business people and tourists alike . As I say the location is excellent but the rooms are just tiny and not particularly pleasurable to be in either I鈥檓 afraid . However , if you don鈥檛 plan to be in the room much and are looking for somewhere central to explore Hong Kong ( as we were ) and without forking out a small fortune for a more exclusive hotel , then this hotel is worth considering .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'just around the corner from Nathan Street'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideal for any shopaholics'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'terrible'], ['Kowloon', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very busy'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'just tiny'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'not particularly pleasurable']]

lose to perfection I stayed in the Royal Park for 4 weeks on a lengthy business trip . In short , this is probably the finest business hotel I have ever stayed in . A few of the things I loved : a nicely decorated , spacious room ; a PC with free internet access ( in the room ) ; a metro station directly under the hotel ; a nice selection of glasses in the room ( tall , tumbler , wine etc . ) ; great food from the many hotel restaurants ; a wide range of toiletries ; a fantastic shower ; free use of a DVD playeror BOSE music system on request ; 8 types of pillow to choose from ( ! ) and finally , impeccable service from all the staff .

Really fantastic This hotel is in an excellent location for visiting London and the tube is just a short walk away on the same street . The staff are very friendly and helpful .

Great Rooms , Noisy Location We spent 4 nights at this hotel in Madrid . The hotel itself is in excellent condition and our room was clean and very comfortable . You could easily walk to all the sights from this location , which made it convenient . The breakfast was top notch as was the lovely rooftop bar .

>If only other hotels can learn from this Omni Our family of four stayed at the Omni San Francisco for a too short 4 - day weekend . We have stayed at a number of other hotels ( including the Ritz - Carlton ) over the years and can honestly say that this was the absolute best experience we have ever had .

My Birthday meal I havnt stayed at this hotel but while staying in Barcelona my wife took me to the Torres for a meal on my birthday . The views are astounding and we were given a table with excellent views of the Magic Fountains which started performing at 21 . 00 hrs and the show was spectacular . The food was excellent and the staff were extremely helpfull and also very knowledgeable about the menus , wine and food . I am a qualifed Chef and my wife and I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world including what is listed as THE best restaurant in the world at the moment by renowned Chefs , The Fat Duck in Bray , UK and found the food and service in The Torres to be of an extremely high standard .

Rip off ! Consumer beware ! Arrived to find a depressingly hot , dank , tiny , shabby UNACCEPTABLE room for the $ 175 + taxes . Although I agreed to pay their $ 50 cancellation fee , my credit card was charged $ 196 . 75 for NO services rendered .

already planning a 2nd trip we stayed at the Royal for a week this March and could not have been more pleased with the service . The hotel is beautifully kept , staff excellent . We booked with hotwire and had standard rooms , no bugs ( ! ) , and we want to return in 2 years for our 30th .

I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard . This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful . Maybe I got unlucky , but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics , I decided to leave the property all together . The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch .

Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years . In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags . The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening , did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them , begging to be let in . The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities , as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk . Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided .####[['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'unsavory'], ['night manager', 'service general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'should be avoided'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'NULL']]

Rather Disappointed ! Dear Reader , after our recent one night stay at the Bali Hyatt , we unfortunately have to confirm the negative review written by LukePerth dated Nov 18 , 2008 . Our room was very humid and loud , which may relate to the structural set - up of the hotel property . We think that it could be worthwhile to invest some more $ $ $ and stay at the Sheraton Laguna Beach Resort in Nusa Dua .####[['Bali Hyatt', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Rather Disappointed'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'very humid and loud']]

Above Average Hotel Stayed for three nights in June 2005 . Slightly overrated . While the rooms were clean and modern ( plasma t . v . , purified water in the bathroom ) , they are very small .

Nice Hotel Nice hotel to stay while on a girls getaway . Located just outside the French Quarter . It was a clean hotel , nicely decorated , however the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small , so if your traveling with 4 - 5 women you may want a larger room .

I was shocked therefore to find a separate charge to my Credit Card by the Arctic Club Hotel for an additional $ 658 . 28 ! ! Calls to the Hotel have not yet received any response , I was merely directed to leave a message for the Hotel Management . . . I will not contemplate staying at this hotel again until they rectify their error and take steps to prevent its recurrence !####[['Arctic Club Hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'Double Charged'], ['Arctic Club Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['Arctic Club Hotel', 'service general', 'negative', 'deeply troubled'], ['Arctic Club Hotel', 'service general', 'negative', 'billed me twice'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'rate was something like $ 290'], ['room', 'rooms prices', 'negative', 'paid $ 749 . 69 upon checking out'], ['Arctic Club Hotel', 'service general', 'negative', 'not yet received any response'], ['Arctic Club Hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not contemplate staying at this hotel again']]

Excellent location This hotel had an excellent location , near Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas . It was also convenient to get to / from the airport with the aerobus stopping at Plaza Catalunya . The rooms were very nicely furnished and quiet and you are greeted with a glass of cava upon arrival . The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful . The only complaint we had was that our room was way too small . From the reviews it seemed that there are larger rooms available , so do ask for those if you can .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'near Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'also convenient'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'very nicely furnished'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'quiet'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'greeted with a glass of cava'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'extremely helpful'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'way too small']]
Warm memories of Hotel David We had a very nice stay for Christmas 2008 at the Hotel David in Florence , Italy . The staff ' s hospitality , the warmth of the hotel all decorated for Christmas , the happy hour next to the fireplace , the spacious clean rooms and wonderful freshly baked pastries for breakfast and Christmas Eve , all contributed to a very memorable visit to Florence . I highly recommend the hotel . You will be lucky if , at the height of the season , you manage to book a room in this hotel ! I give it a rating of excellent for our overall experience .####[['Hotel David', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'very nice stay'], ['Hotel David', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Warm memories'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spacious'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'wonderful freshly baked pastries'], ['Hotel David', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'highly recommend'], ['Hotel David', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'rating of excellent']]
Superb Hotel Stayed for 4 nights April 8 - 12th . Great staff - room was immaculate and more importantly , the bathroom was very clean . Price was extremely reasonable for a hotel 2 blocks from 42nd / Broadway ( Times Square ) ! Plasma TV was a nice plus . Although no inhouse room - service , there are LOTS of restaurants close by that are open late and will deliver right up to your room . Highly recommended .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Superb'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'immaculate'], ['bathroom', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'very clean'], ['Hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Price was extremely reasonable'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '2 blocks from 42nd / Broadway ( Times Square '], ['Plasma TV', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'nice plus'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'no inhouse room - service'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Highly recommended'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'LOTS of restaurants close by that are open late']]
Will stay here again when in NYC The location is great , in walking distance to so much . The staff was wonderful and responsive to our needs . The room was so clean and flawless , and the food was great in the restaurant on the main floor . Overall a super experience . One tip , we walked one block east to the Port Authority and caught the New York Airport Service Express Bus for $ 12 each way to and from La Guardia .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'walking distance to so much'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'responsive'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'flawless'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'great'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['NULL', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'super experience']]
