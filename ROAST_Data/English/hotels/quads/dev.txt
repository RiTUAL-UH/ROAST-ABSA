Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me . I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in . The staff are very helpful , professional and friendly . The decor is very tasteful , the location is great , the price is very good value , the mini bar was very reasonably priced , the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel . I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'more like a 4 star'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'professional'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['hotel', 'hotel design_features', 'positive', 'decor is very tasteful'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'great'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'price is very good value'], ['mini bar', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'very reasonably priced'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'exceptionally clean'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very quiet'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'such a centrally located'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'certainly return'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'recommend']]
Nice Hotel , Great location This hotel was very nice and a great location . Fisherman ' s Wharf is only a few blocks aways , as well as all the Alcatraz tours and the Trolleys .

A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in ! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted . Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station , bus and tram stops etc . One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution , we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'really nice'], ['hotel', 'service general', 'positive', 'upgraded to a harbour view room'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'spotless'], ['staff', 'service general', 'neutral', 'not be faulted'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station'], ['swimming pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'free']]
Good Service but Loud The location is quite convienent with many good restaurants in the neighborhood . The staff was very friendly and very helpful . On dinner recommendations they were 4 for 4 and they greeted every request with a smile . The main negative is the room was very loud , although being from NYC it did not prevent me from sleeping .

Superb Hotel Me and my wife stayed in the Intercontinental in Singapore for 2 nights in our Honeymoon Trip around Asia and Pacific . The Staff is excellent as well as the service and the Breakfest Buffet ( fantastic ! ! ) . The room is large with all new and modern amenities .

City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home . The avenue is about a ten minute walk from the station and allowed us to leave our luggage all day so that we could go round the city long before we could check in . It is within 5 minutes of Dam square and really well placed on one of the main tram routes . The rooms were small but clean and all of the staff really friendly . bar prices were very reasonable for a hotel .####[['City Convenience', 'location general', 'positive', 'ten minute walk from the station'], ['City Convenience', 'hotel miscellaneous', 'positive', 'allowed us to leave our luggage all day'], ['City Convenience', 'location general', 'positive', 'within 5 minutes of Dam square'], ['City Convenience', 'location general', 'positive', 'really well placed'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'small'], ['rooms', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'really friendly'], ['bar', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'prices were very reasonable']]

Good value weekend break When we stayed , they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money . We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel . Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times . Good location in a quiet area and convenient for buses and trains .

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel , or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service , a very modern and up to date decor , large and comfortable rooms , all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops . The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11 . 00am just in case we ' d had a late night , a sun terrace on the roof with a ( small ) pool and gymnasium , although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife .

Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel , three great pools to choose from . My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials , we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade , 75 $ resort credit ,  complimentary bottle of wine .

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton - family properties , and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay , it was hardly worth the price paid . Good points : very friendly staff , and terrific restaurantBad points : the room was dated - old rundown furniture , warped bathtub , stained bedding . I was only offered a double - queen suite in the main building , which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements . Overall , I ' ve had much better accomodations at Embassy Suites and Doubletrees in the hilton family . Next time , I would stay elsewhere in the area , and just drive over to dine at the Different Pointe of View restaurant .####[['Hilton', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'hardly worth the price'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very friendly'], ['restaurant', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'terrific'], ['room', 'rooms quality', 'negative', 'dated'], ['furniture', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'old rundown'], ['bathtub', 'room_amenities quality', 'negative', 'warped'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'stained bedding'], ['staff', 'service general', 'negative', 'only offered a double - queen suite'], ['Hilton', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'stay elsewhere']]
Great rooms The check in was extremely fast and friendly and we were even given a room upgrade which was a lovely surprise . There was some building work going on to the outside but other than a bit of dust there were no issues with thisThe room itself was immaculately clean and had a very contemporary and well thought out feel . The rain shower was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortableThe location was great , with easy walking access to all the major parts of the city .

Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown , with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links . Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean . Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit , and walls were on the thin side , but these were minor issues . Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good . Good food nearby at Changs ( in Westlake ) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place .

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment , but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes , and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes , which improved the whole situation . The hotel is really quite plush , the rooms had everything we needed , and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free ! The staff were very helpful , and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go . The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others , but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day , and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water , wasn ' t to be turned down . It is definitely a hotel I would visit again , particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years .####[['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Fine'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'negative', 'bit of a disappointment'], ['Hotel', 'location general', 'neutral', 'walk to the sea in 10 minutes'], ['Hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'really quite plush'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'everything we neede'], ['fridge', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'impressed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'replaced daily free'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very helpful'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'knowledgeable'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'negative', 'discontent'], ['Menu del Dia', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['Hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'visit again']]
Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki isn ' t great The location is good , right in Waikiki , close by the Honolulu Zoo , the price is one of the lowest online , but you really don ' t know what it really like till you stay here .

Bargain and convenient location For years , I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only . The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room . The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front . if , like me , you juts need a place to sleep and shower , the beds could be better but the water has always been hot , and it is a bargain ! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here , but I am barely in the room , so why pay more ? I will be spending my 3rd vacation there in 2 weeks .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'Bargain'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'tired'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'use a major update'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'fabulous'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'ocean view'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'convenient to everything'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'bus stops right in front'], ['beds', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'could be better'], ['water', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'always been hot'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'bargain']]
Don ' t arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor . I had a reservation for a room with a large bed . When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds . They did find a room with one large bed , in the smoking rooms , but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby . For 140 Euro , I expected a lot more .

Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers . the room was perfect , great space which is unusual for New York , beautiful view , excellent location . The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor . The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly . But the reception area is really nice .

harming ! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed . We had room # 11 , which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn , but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast . We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by . The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful .

Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming , so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there . The lobby is absolutely exquisite , and the staff were warm and welcoming . The rooms didn ' t quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side . However , the bathrooms were larger than most I ' ve seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean .

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days ( before going back to work  reality ) . We were in the first group to leave the ship , so we arrived at the hotel at 9 : 30am ! The staff couldn ' t have been friendlier . They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits , and we sunned at the beach  had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2 : 30pm .

Great location for an Amsterdam stopover The other reviews are right , the hotel is close to everything - trains , RLD , restaurants , shopping , etc . Reasonably clean - not spotless . We stayed on the first floor and the room while adequate was tired . Breakfast was excellent and security good . We didn ' t encounter any problems with Charlie boys hassling us . We would recommend this hotel for a one or two night stay .####[['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Great'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'close to everything - trains , RLD , restaurants , shopping'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'Reasonably clean'], ['hotel', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'not spotless'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'adequate'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'tired'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['security', 'service general', 'positive', 'good'], ['security', 'service general', 'positive', "didn ' t encounter any problems"], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'recommend']]

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month . Tastefully decorated , spacious and clean rooms , friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room ! The location is ideal as it is close to everything you could possibly want to do in the Big Apple and there really is no need to take cabs as the subway is minutes away .

Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site , and the hotel lived up to expectations ! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help . We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children , but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around , so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room ! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food ! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again , having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Loved'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lived up to expectations'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'Very very friendly'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'safe'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['Breakfast', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'great'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'loved'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'definitely recommend'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'would stay again'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lots of CCTV cameras around'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great adventure'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'couldnt do enough to help']]
Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington . The hotel is conveniently located ( about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro ) , the staff is friendly and accomodating , and the suites are comfortable and well laid out . The 32 ' ' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus . Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items ( eggs , omelets , etc ) and an evening cocktail reception , both of which are fantastic . The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro ( about a 5 - 10 minute ride ) .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'conveniently located'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', '3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'accomodating'], ['suites', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfortable'], ['suites', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'well laid out'], ["32 ' ' flat screen tv", 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'definate plus'], ['breakfast buffet', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['evening cocktail reception', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'few stops away on the Metro']]
Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel . The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying .

Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels , so Laguna had to meet the expectations , and mostly it did . My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool . Service was mostly impeccable . My only 2 small grouses were that check - in was long and that it was difficult to find a sundeck chair by the pool . It would have helped if staff was on hand to help guests find available chairs .####[['Laguna', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'meet the expectations'], ['Laguna', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Pretty good'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'large'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'raised platform and balcony facing the pool'], ['Service', 'service general', 'positive', 'mostly impeccable'], ['Service', 'service general', 'negative', 'check - in was long'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'negative', 'difficult to find a sundeck chair'], ['Service', 'service general', 'neutral', 'would have helped if staff was on hand to help']]
Welcoming and friendly staff , elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel . The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel , from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants . The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous , with antique brick walls and elaborate , lush curtains . My favorite part of the hotel ( besides the amazing staff ) , was the location . It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions ( the steamboat tours , downtown New Orleans , The French Quarter , etc ) .

Personally . . . They have an excellent personal service , I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included , because I had to pay 12 euros per head .

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews . Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar , were helpful , friendly and entertaining . Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated . The view alone is worth the visit ! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I ' ve visited .

Absolutely brilliant . . . Myself and my girlfriend stayed 3 nights at this hotel just recently . I can highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the brilliant city of Barcelona .

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights . Despite the other reviews which might scare you off , we found the staff friendly and very responsive , room was clean and in good shape , and only a few very minor issues . Whenever we called , someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less ( e . g . extra blankets and pillows ) . This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt . Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore . About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior - - - though there were plenty of grab bars .####[['the Elizabeth', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Very acceptable and friendly choice'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'very responsive'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'good shape'], ['the Elizabeth', 'location general', 'positive', 'conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt .

Great Resort , Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites , pools and golf , but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation .

Nice , clean , and a great place for families . Nice location within walking distance of the Space Needle . We had a 2 bedroom suite which we felt was a great price for the location . Free breakfast is your basic continental plus waffles , although there were long lines for this . The free parking was a real plus . I stayed at other hotels downtown that charged $ 25 a night .####[['hotels', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['hotels', 'hotel cleanliness', 'positive', 'clean'], ['hotels', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'great place for families'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Nice'], ['suite', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'great price for the location'], ['breakfast', 'food_drinks prices', 'positive', 'Free'], ['parking', 'facilities prices', 'positive', 'free'], ['parking', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'real plus']]
Sleeping Easy in the Big Easy After getting a great rate on Hotwire ( $ 103 for three consecutive nights during a convention ) I was very pleased arriving in a traditional W hotel . It had all the things you expect to find : a hip rockin ' lounge , stylish goth lobby , and a surprisingly friendly and inviting staff . Even with a Hotwire booked reservation , the staff honored my platinum Starwood membership and upgraded me to a huge suite ( three of us got upgraded separately ) . The room was typical W , meaning all the comfort you expect ( big , soft bed with great linens , awesome shower , and plasma TV ' s ) .

mfortable Room , Chic space I stayed here recently on a work trip . The hotel was pretty cool as it had a variety of art pieces throughout the location and in each of the rooms . This hotel is in the warehouse district and within walking distance to some great restaurants a coffee shop and galleries galore . Also , not too far off from the Quarter . The workout room on the top floor was nice and well apportioned and the pool ( also on the top floor ) had nice views of the city / river .

Ok location , great hotel Spent one night at the hotel with my wife . The room is neither luxurious nor large , and the bathroom is also small , but the hotel and room were new , very clean and larger than some we had seen on the internet , judging by the photos . It even had a nice view of one small charming canal . The staff was also very polite and helpful .

I decided to stay at this hotel not only because of the overall favorably opinions but mainly because of the rapport between quality and price , which turned out to be excellent .

Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features , some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat . However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff . Minus points were the size of the bedroom ( small ) ; a sliding door on the bathroom that didn ' t have any pretence at privacy ; high bar prices ( $ 14 for a glass of wine ) and exorbitant parking charges ( $ 37 per day ) when there were public facilities on the same block ( for $ 24 a day . ) Overall , good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back . Darrin , the bar steward would make me want to go back though , just for the entertainment value .

Great Location Shabby Room Although the Ambassador was well located , had a pleasant and helpful staff , and good food service , I will probably not stay there again .

amazing holiday where the bad reviews come from for this hotel i do not know because i had a fantastic time in this lovely resort . the food was beautiful , the scenery was lovely and the staff are amazing , utterly amazing . they would get games of football going or volleyball or take you away to learn spanish or do a poolside game , the bar staff are all lovely , waiters in the buffet area were very hardworking where nothhing was too much hassle . all the differant workers here wear uniforms so you know exactly who to see about anything . the pool was great with balls supplied and goalposts in the pool and on the beach , from my room both the pool and beach were less than a minutes walk away . best holiday i have ever had####[['resort', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'lovely'], ['food', 'food_drinks quality', 'positive', 'beautiful'], ['resort', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'scenery was lovely'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'amazing'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'utterly amazing'], ['bar staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'all lovely'], ['waiters', 'service general', 'positive', 'very hardworking'], ['pool', 'facilities general', 'positive', 'great'], ['room', 'rooms miscellaneous', 'positive', 'less than a minutes walk away']]
A Perfect base We have just returned from our first NY visit and stayed at the Casablanca for four nights , largely on the basis of good reviews . We were not disappointed . The staff are friendly and helpful , the rooms which I had read were small were no smaller than most city hotels , Rick ' s Cafe with the complimentary breakfast , all day tea / coffee muffins newspapers and evening cheese / wine was an oasis of sanity and the location is very convenient ( walkable for most first visit sightseeing ) . We would strongly recommend this hotel unless you want the fitness club / swimming pool / restaurant type experience of a large chain hotel .####[['Casablanca', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'Perfect base'], ['Casablanca', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'not disappointed'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'friendly and helpful'], ['rooms', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'no smaller than most city hotels'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'very convenient'], ['Casablanca', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'strongly recommend']]

From what I could see , other more expensive hotels near the area probably can ' t claim to have the view that we did .

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used ( think they may have gone out of business now as can ' t find them any more ) to the Hotel Piet Hein . When we arrived thought nice hotel , only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel ' s annex which was a few doors down the same street . Absolute nightmare of a room , up three flights of very steep stairs , room very dirty , ripped curtains , mould in bathroom , stained carpets , etc . Didn ' t get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in . In short , not somewhere I would reccomend . That said , things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago , but beware when booking , make sure its the main hotel which is really nice .####[['room', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'Absolute nightmare'], ['Annex', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'very steep stairs'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'very dirty'], ['room', 'rooms quality', 'negative', 'ripped curtains'], ['bathroom', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'mould'], ['room', 'rooms cleanliness', 'negative', 'stained carpets'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'negative', "Didn ' t get our own key to the door"], ['Annex', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'not somewhere I would reccomend']]
Uber - fantastic - hotel Great weekend getaway to the Commonwealth . Fantastic bed , linens , pillows - - could have slept until check out . I swear there were 2 kinds of toilet paper as well - - quilted and regular . Never seen that before . A bit annoyed by the $ 34 a night for parking , but would happily stay again and again . Will hope to try the hotel ' s bars / restaurants next time !####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['NULL', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'Fantastic bed , linens , pillows'], ['NULL', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'slept until check out '], ['parking', 'facilities prices', 'negative', 'bit annoyed by the $ 34 a night'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'happily stay again and again'], ['toilet paper', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'Never seen that before']]
Brought home bedbugs Beautiful setting , but vast hotel and a little impersonal . Okay beach on a separate island that you have to take a boat to ( free , every half hour ) .

Heavenly stay My stay at the Westin Park Central truly was Heavenly . I can ' t remember a better nights sleep away from home . The room was clean , service was okay , but I can ' t get over how comfortable the bed was ! And you must have a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning .

Start Spreading the Muse . . . We stayed at the Muse a few weeks ago ( Feb 08 ) . It was a fantastic experience . The staff was great , the room was spacious ( by NY standards ) and the bed was very , very comfortable . You cannot beat the location of the hotel - a half block from Times Square and right in the middle of everthing . The price was reasonable ( again , by NY standards ) and we would return tomorrow if we could .####[['Muse', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'fantastic experience'], ['staff', 'service general', 'positive', 'great'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'positive', 'spacious'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'bed was very , very comfortable'], ['location', 'location general', 'positive', 'cannot beat'], ['Muse', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'price was reasonable']]
Mass toerism After one week staying at Meridien Nirwana we moved for another week to Melia . As we arrived we were surprised by all the loudly people laying at the pool and the beach . It seemed we arrvived in Spain or Turkey . Really this hotel is not worth a 5 star rating . After one night staying we packed our bags and left the hotel .####[['Melia', 'hotel quality', 'negative', 'not worth a 5 star rating'], ['Melia', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'packed our bags and left the hotel '], ['pool', 'facilities comfort', 'negative', 'surprised by all the loudly people laying']]
Excellent Location I stayed at this hotel for pleasure using Marriott Reward points for 2 nights . The hotel is ideally situated in the Circular Quay area , only 3 minutes from the City Train stop from the airport . Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney , including the Rocks area , Harbor Bridge , shopping , Rocks market , and ferries to Manly and everywhere else . The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area . The room provided was better than average for Marriott , with all amenities and nice shower .####[['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'ideally situated in the Circular Quay area'], ['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'better than average for Marriott'], ['amenities', 'room_amenities general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'nice shower']]
great location Location is great , near corner of Orchard and Scotts . Club lounge is nice , although no hot offering at breakfast , which although ok for my wife , expect a hot offering at Grand Hyatt Grand Clubs ( best is in HK ) .

Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again . If your looking for a clean room , near Bourbon Street , friendly staff , at a good price - this is the place . I also was in and out of a few other hotels were relatives were staying , if your looking for four elevators , and a large lobby , and all the stuff that comes with a large big name hotel - you aren ' t going to get it at the St .

Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it . Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it ' s a good standard hotel it ' s no longer that great . Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that . Now seems full of coch parties , meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners . A real shame .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'Disapointed'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'no longer that great'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'negative', 'sadly now lost that'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'full of coch parties , meetings over breakfast tables'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'slightly cuttig corners'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'real shame']]
Great stopover We stopped over in Singapore on our way to Bali and decieded to stay at the Fullerton for our second time in 2 years .

Location , Location , Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters , this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms ( new plasma TV ' s ) at an incredibly good price . Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring . Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones , etc . but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay . We had three rooms for five days ( in both of the hotel ' s two buildings ) and everyone was content . Would return in a minute .####[['Location', 'location general', 'positive', 'Restaurant Row and near the major theaters'], ['rooms', 'rooms general', 'positive', 'nicely furnished'], ["plasma TV ' s", 'room_amenities design_features', 'positive', 'new'], ['rooms', 'rooms prices', 'positive', 'incredibly good price'], ['Mike', 'service general', 'positive', 'exceptionally helpful'], ['Heater controls', 'room_amenities general', 'negative', 'hard to locate'], ['Mike', 'service general', 'positive', 'little info available on use of phones'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'such a comfortable stay']]
ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance / house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day . The hotel seemed very fake and tried to be hip . The rooms were very comfortable with nice pillows and comfy bed though . Overall , there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'positive', 'ultra trendy'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'lame'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'played loud dance / house music until 9pm every night'], ['hotel', 'hotel comfort', 'negative', 'impossible to take any kind of nap or relax'], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'very fake'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'very comfortable'], ['rooms', 'rooms quality', 'positive', 'nice pillows'], ['rooms', 'rooms comfort', 'positive', 'comfy bed']]
Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny , barely lit , musty and just unbearable .

It ' ll be great when it ' s finished ! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel . We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed , the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom . Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room . The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there .

Wouldn ' t recommend it . This Hotel looks great online . Although the price is right , it doesn ' t make up for the cleanliness .

Not for me Didn ' t really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities , however we knew this before checking in . The room we had was very basic , had no safe , was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel , were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed . The hotel is well situated for Market Street and Powell Street and is fine if you ' re looking for an economy hotel and economy it certainly is .####[['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', "Didn ' t really like"], ['hotel', 'hotel general', 'negative', 'lack of en suite facilities'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'neutral', 'very basic'], ['room', 'rooms general', 'negative', 'no safe'], ['room', 'rooms design_features', 'negative', 'tiny'], ['room', 'rooms comfort', 'negative', 'subjected to noise during the night'], ['hotel', 'location general', 'positive', 'well situated'], ['hotel', 'hotel prices', 'positive', 'economy it certainly is']]
