friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner , given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures , and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were , which we found to be most helpful . The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast ( buffet ) , it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers . A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found , also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby , making the hotel very central but not noisey . We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible . A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam .####[['staff', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'clean', 'positive'], ['staff', 'treated in a very friendly manner', 'positive'], ['staff', 'most helpful', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'small', 'negative'], ['breakfast ( buffet ', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['on line', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['library', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'very central', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'not noisey', 'positive'], ['staff', 'stay as carefree and pleasant as possible', 'positive'], ['staff', 'big thankyou', 'positive']]
Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause . We were not sure what to expect .

Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October , our second stay there , and it was lovely . If possible , ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias . We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain , the cathedrals and the hillsides around town . The restaurant , Mark ' s , is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island .

Not great Most of the staff had a poor command of English .

ute hotel , but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station , the Accademia and the Duomo , however the noise at night was unbearable ! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street , so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel . But if you plan to stay here , make sure you request a room in the back , away from the street ( there are many ) .

The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever ! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough , but no , they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites .

Fabulous , and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel . Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city .

Don ' t believe anything you read or half of what your hear We recently came back from this resort . It is advertised on the Sol Melia website as being fully renovated , which it hasn ' t been touched in eight years and is in need of a complete overhaul . The food is mediocure at best , 11 restaurants , only three or four open each night , beach chairs moldy and streached out , dirty beach , mildewed rooms , worn fabrics and furniture in rooms , mini bar not stocked or cold , disagreeable staff , bad service and bugs in the rooms .

The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona . We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris , so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury .

Pure Quality , if you don ' t mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week . Had a great room overlooking the church ( 17th floor ) . I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal , service was good and the bar area was impressive . This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside , but you do pay for it - ( my room rate was of around $ 600 a night ) . Overall very happy with the hotel , though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $ 27 .####[['hotel', 'ideal', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Pure Quality', 'positive'], ['room', 'great', 'positive'], ['service', 'good', 'positive'], ['bar', 'area was impressive', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'quite stunning inside', 'positive'], ['room', 'rate was of around $ 600 a night', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'very happy', 'positive'], ['towels', 'seem a little excessive', 'positive'], ['towels', 'clean', 'positive'], ['cornflakes', 'had to laugh', 'negative']]
The wost hotel I have ever been in . Without a doubt , this has been the worst hotel I have ever been . Filthy , smelly , room without windows , squeaky beds . . . and the morning breakfast . . . better I will not comment about it .

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights ' stay at the NY Palace , I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC . My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality , the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated , with a beautiful view of St . Patrick Cathedral on top of those , the use of the lounge was a great boon for us , supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant , friendly and civilized surroundings , the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not - so - friendly city as New York . Also , unlike what was written in a previous preview , we were there with our five yrs old child ( having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level ) and he was always made to feel at home ( I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there ) . I will definitely return to the Palace .####[['concierge', 'reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality', 'positive'], ['concierge', 'given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations', 'positive'], ['room', 'beautiful view of St .

Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter , picking the location for it ' s convenience for the airport for a flight the next day . Rooms are small and functional , bathroom ' unit ' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed . Bedding was a little strange , with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers . Staff were efficient , breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time ( despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised ) . It ' s a decent enough place , even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it ' s proximity to the runway .####[['NULL', 'Basic accomodation', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'near the airport', 'positive'], ['location', 'convenience for the airport', 'positive'], ['Rooms', 'small', 'negative'], ['Rooms', 'functional', 'positive'], ['bathroom', 'clever use of space', 'positive'], ['bathroom', 'big enough', 'positive'], ['Rooms', 'Bedding was a little strange', 'neutral'], ['bedsheets', 'wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers', 'negative'], ['Staff', 'efficient', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'good', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'decent enough place', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'still get some noise from aircraft', 'negative']]

Langham Stay We were supposed to have a superior room . We looked out over the roof air conditioners on the fifth floor - say you prefer not to have room 564 .

Great location , not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size . I reserved directly with the hostel by email ( in Spanish ) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going , specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square . However , we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal , overlooking the road that was being dug up . Although they said the next day we could move rooms , they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning , which was rather annoying . Overall , it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile .####[['location', 'Great', 'positive'], ['staff', 'not so great', 'negative'], ['hostal', 'very centrally located', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'clean', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'vary a lot in size', 'neutral'], ['staff', 'put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal', 'negative'], ['staff', 'annoying', 'negative'], ['hostal', 'good value', 'positive'], ['location', 'made it worthwhile', 'positive']]

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big , new hotel . When you step in to the lobby of the hotel , it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s . Although , the modern amenities in the room and the lobby make the hotel really comfortable .

Fantastic Hotel ! The Hotel Royal is in a brilliant location on La Rambla right in the heart of Barcelona . The staff was overly helpful and very attentive .

great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay , excellent choice , everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great , rooms little small but never in em only to sleep . Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive , find the cava bar by the port side street , cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down . In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed .

fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor , and yet again have not been let down . This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona , the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel , to when you leave . We had a standard room for four nights , and it was just what we needed , I understand that there are better rooms , but this was above what you normally get in this price range . There was plenty of space , the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy , Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas , but when its cold and wet , we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway .

Great hotel in the middle of nowhere Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel , modern , fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it . Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views . The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit . Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area .####[['hotel', 'Great', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'very impressed', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'modern', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'fun', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'great', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'bit of a conference centre feel', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'offered the most spectacular views', 'positive'], ['restaurant', 'roof is excellent', 'positive'], ['restaurant', 'well worth', 'positive'], ['hotel', '25 mins cab drive from the centre', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'nothing to see in the immediate area', 'negative']]

Horrendous customer service Overall , stay was just okay , but was tainted by management ' s unwillingness to honor their own quoted / written and confirmed total cost . At check - out , ended up paying additional 10 % because of hotel ' s error in confirmation , even after being told at check - in that they would honor confirmed price . For this alone , would never recommend or stay there again , and we do intend to visit San Juan again . Conceptually , hotel was great architectural idea .

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you ' re driving a car . The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address ; according to the GPS in our rented car , the address did not even exist . It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport ( if one doesn ' t take a shuttle ) , and consequently we almost missed our plane .

Not bad but could be better , even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations - - really quite nice , but the room itself was fairly spartan . It did have a little sitting area , with two chairs and a table , but the beds were rock hard ( you want to ease down on them gently , lest you break a body part ) . The air conditioning was non - operative during our very warm stay in early - mid May ( the screenless window opened , however ) , the TV remote control did not work , although there was an attempt to repair it , and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced - - and was , with one that smelled somewhat less musty . On the positive side , the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful , the public areas and the rooms were immaculate , the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient , if not particularly appealing . 聽聽####[['NULL', 'Not bad but could be better', 'neutral'], ['bathrooms', 'most luxurious part', 'positive'], ['bathrooms', 'really quite nice', 'positive'], ['room', 'fairly spartan', 'positive'], ['room', 'little sitting area', 'positive'], ['two chairs and a table', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['room', 'beds were rock hard', 'negative'], ['air conditioning', 'non - operative', 'negative'], ['TV', 'remote control did not work', 'negative'], ['blanket', 'smelled so musty', 'negative'], ['staff', 'extremely nice', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['room', 'immaculate', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'immaculate', 'positive'], ['buffet breakfast', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['room', 'reasonable', 'positive'], ['location', 'convenient', 'positive']]

I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable , it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner .####[['location', 'great', 'positive'], ['location', 'fantastic', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'well laid out', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very well serviced', 'positive'], ['Byrant', 'not reccomend', 'negative'], ['staff', 'snooty attitute of quite a few', 'negative'], ['Byrant', 'very uncomfortable', 'negative']]

bad to be true i stayed 1 night on january 1 , first we were assigned a room that had not been cleaned ( at 6 in the afternoon ) we were given another room but this one had no water , this resolved we had no hot water ( we were told by other guests that this problem was 4 days old ) we were imformed that this problem was outside the hotel . At 10 . : 30 we went to the lounge area and the receptionist practicly kiked us away closing the tv and telling us we could not stay there . The room although modern were filled with defects , like electric cables hanging . I don麓t know how this is a 4 star hotel . stay away from this hotel if you ca####[['hotel', 'bad to be true', 'negative'], ['room', 'not been cleaned', 'negative'], ['room', 'no water', 'negative'], ['room', 'no hot water', 'negative'], ['receptionist', 'practicly kiked us away closing the tv', 'negative'], ['receptionist', 'not stay there', 'negative'], ['room', 'modern were filled with defects', 'conflict'], ['hotel', 'don麓t know how', 'negative']]
Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect . Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one .

Fine Location , Good Service Fine hotel in a downtown location . A mentioned by other reviewers , the rooms are on the small side but entirely adequate . Service was friendly and welcoming .

Yawn , it ' s another Hilton It ' s a Hilton . If you ' ve stayed in one before , you know what you ' re going to get . Soul - less luxury , well - trained but passionless staff , a feeling of anonymity . If you ' re paying for yourself ( as opposed to business expenses ) , it ' s probably not worth the money .

great little hotel My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights art start of july and it was perfect for what we wanted - a real find . Located in quiet area but a quick 15 - 20 mins walk to San Marco square . Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was lovely ( far surpassed expectations , Fruit , croissants , cheese , meat and lovely coffee made fresh from espresso maker ) served in the little courtyard . While it has a 2 star rating , its because it doesn ' t have things like elevators , a big fancy lobby or iron for guests , but everything else about it was 4 star !####[['hotel', 'great little', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Located in quiet area', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'quick 15 - 20 mins walk to San Marco square', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'far surpassed expectations', 'positive'], ['coffee', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['hotel', '4 star', 'positive']]

Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge - but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[['Sofitel', 'Great', 'positive'], ['location', 'fantastic', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'little small', 'negative'], ['rooms', 'spotless', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'smaller bedrooms', 'negative'], ['bathrooms', 'more than make up', 'positive'], ['staff', 'attention to detail is great', 'positive'], ['staff', 'late check out at short notice and for no extra charge', 'positive'], ['location', '2 mins from Times square', 'positive'], ['location', 'nearly all the main sites are within working distance', 'positive']]
Divine ! This hotel , with its immaculately clean and well - fitted rooms , situated at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence , is the perfect base for any holiday in this extraordinarily beautiful , safe and secure city . The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful , the service is splendid , however what really sets this hotel apart from the rest is the Breakfast Room on the 6th Floor with its stunning views of the Duomo , the Campanile and a myriad of terra - cotta rooftops .

Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point , in June 2007 . We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic .

A happy accident We were put into this hotel by BA when our aircraft developed a mechanical problem and the return flight to London had to be delayed until the next day . In every way the Sheraton Gateway was better than the Holiday Inn at LAX where we spent the first night of our recent holiday .

Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms , so we decided to try this ( based on reviews from TripAdvisor , of course ) . Upon arriving at the airport ( Narita ) , we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there , right across the street from the hotel . Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo , but that ' s a 5 minute train ride , with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3 ~ 5 . About the hotel it is huge , with many options for food and entertainment , I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses . Depending on which tower you stay in ( Main Tower was great ) , the rooms are new , but a bit small , with everything needed in a hotel , including a small fridge ( bring your snacks and water ) . Very clean , nothing to say about that , except that some floors smelled like cigarretts . Internet is paid ( about US $ 10 . 00 ) and it is wired , so bring your wireless router ( Apple makes a great pocket - sized one ) . There ' s a convenience store downstairs , that over charges everything , but when needed it ' s there .####[['hotel', 'huge', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Main Tower was great', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'new', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'bit small', 'negative'], ['fridge', 'small', 'negative'], ['rooms', 'Very clean', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'some floors smelled like cigarretts', 'negative'], ['Internet', 'paid ( about US $ 10 . 00 ', 'negative'], ['convenience store', 'over charges everything', 'negative']]
Go for the Casitas ! The El conquistador Casitas were awesome . The one I stayed in was huge with a full kitchen and ocean view from the balcony .

We enjoyed the above - par service , the clean and cozy room ( yes , a little tight but workable ) , the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24 / 7 , and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere - - all at a very reasonable price .

Be wary ! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc . However , I found there was some rather foul stains ( females staying along do not make marks like that ) on the duvet cover , which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc .

Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5 , 2005 . It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10 : 20 p . m . on the night of Saturday 2nd . It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night . I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me . I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night .

A nice , affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona , but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price . Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord , you can ' t stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona ' s top sights . Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street . Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room , and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early ( 9 : 30ish ) in the morning . Otherwise , this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city .####[['Grupotel Gravina', 'nice', 'positive'], ['location', 'perfect', 'positive'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'affordable', 'positive'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'good price', 'positive'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'wonderful home base for seeing the city', 'positive'], ['location', 'Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla', 'positive'], ['room', 'nice size', 'positive'], ['room', 'balcony that overlooked a quiet street', 'positive'], ['room', 'hear the noise in the hallway', 'negative'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'definitely a great choice', 'positive'], ['Grupotel Gravina', 'saving a few Euros', 'positive']]
A La Cart Charges for everything Let me just start by saying that parking costs $ 34 dollars a day . I may have been ok with this had I known , but I did not see this anywhere when I booked using the hotel website .

Good for Marathoners Stayed here for the Marathon weekend , like they said it ' s not a great neighbourhood but you can ' t beat the price , parking is free , and the complimentary breakfast is what you need . The free shuttle bus worked well most of the time , we used it to get to the subway . They even made sure it was good to go for us marathon morning .

Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii . It was definitely impressive , though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare . Still , it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos . My hotel room had what I ' d call a partial ocean view , you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view . I was suprised at how noisy the street below me was , even on the 26th floor , I heard even car horn , every screaming baby , every yelling partier on the street , all night long .####[['Oceanarium', 'Loved', 'positive'], ['Oceanarium', 'definitely impressive', 'positive'], ['lunch menu', 'shares space with it was pretty spare', 'negative'], ['restaurant', 'just to take photos', 'positive'], ['room', 'partial ocean view', 'neutral'], ['room', 'noisy the street below me was', 'negative']]

Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days . The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all , it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem . The main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk . I would certainly use the AB Viladomat if I were to travel to Barcelona again .####[['AB Viladomat', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'highly recomend', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'clean', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'good value', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'very pleasant place', 'positive'], ['staff', 'all very friendly', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'great difficulty in faulting', 'positive'], ['AB Viladomat', 'little way away from the city centre', 'neutral'], ['AB Viladomat', 'main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk', 'positive']]

Enjoyed our stay ! We stayed here for a week while our daughter played soccer in the area and found this hotel modern , clean and the staff very helpful .

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July ; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years . An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff . Great location in Midtown on the East Side , close to restaurants , shopping and an easy walk , cab or subway ride to museums . Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency . My only complaint is the high prices for room service and still a $ 10 per day charge for high speed internet .####[['The Benjamin', 'Great', 'positive'], ['The Benjamin', 'right price', 'positive'], ['The Benjamin', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very attentive', 'positive'], ['staff', 'professional', 'positive'], ['location', 'Great', 'positive'], ['The Benjamin', 'Highly recommended', 'positive'], ['service', 'high prices for room', 'negative'], ['internet', 'still a $ 10 per day charge', 'negative']]
Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest . Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty . Hair in sink and bath was off putting . Best measure of ( lack of ) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window . We were told someone would clean , then they would clean next day - needless to say it remained uncleaned on check out two days later .

Great hotel , but not so great location The hotel is very modern , with an air of trendiness , the furniture is new and very nice , the bathroom is large , well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny . On the other hand , some things are a little kitchy , like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room ( first I thought it ' s parquet ) , the breakfast is really poor , the parking a little too expensive ( 15 euros a day ) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying . The hotel is near the train station , but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room . Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls . It takes about 15 minutes to the center .####[['hotel', 'Great', 'positive'], ['location', 'not so great', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'very modern', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'air of trendiness', 'positive'], ['furniture', 'new', 'positive'], ['furniture', 'very nice', 'positive'], ['bathroom', 'large', 'positive'], ['room', 'well equiped', 'positive'], ['room', 'entire place is clean', 'positive'], ['room', 'shiny', 'positive'], ['room', 'little kitchy', 'negative'], ['breakfast', 'really poor', 'negative'], ['parking', 'little too expensive', 'negative'], ['bathroom', 'glass door from the bathroom annoying', 'negative'], ['location', 'near the train station', 'positive'], ['room', 'can hear everything through the walls', 'negative'], ['location', 'takes about 15 minutes to the center', 'positive']]
Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A ' dam . A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station . We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean , attractive and had an great bathroom . The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little ( not mid - forties with beard ) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room ( free tea / coffee / chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free ) Only minor points but will be staying there again in September . Try the DutchFlyer website ( Stena lines ) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing .

A series of annoyances Another review mentions that the hotel is 10 minutes away from Schiphol . True - - but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels ' and it ' s a 20 euro cab ride . My experience of the hotel was a series of difficulties - - a reservation canceled without notice , a free wifi system that was down ( a fact discovered only after spending ten minutes on the phone being given various nonworking passwords ) , a general lack of timely information from the desk clerks . This hotel is in a suburban business district - - it may be very convenient and useful on workdays ; my very short stay there , on a Saturday , after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip , was nothing but a series of frustrations .####[['hotel', '10 minutes away from Schiphol .

Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24 / 7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino , but the rooms themselves are a little tired .

Decent deal , decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean , has a modern Asian feel in the decour , and a decent breakfast to start you on your way . The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge . Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring . This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn ' t seem to know where it was .

Stayed at the Kimberly June 24 - 27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr , 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice ! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6 . They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable , pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location , nice doormen , and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we ' d stay again -####[['Kimberly', 'upgraded to a 3 bedr suite', 'positive'], ['Kimberly', 'how nice', 'positive'], ['bedr', 'no living room and no full kitchen', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'moved us to 2 one bedr suites', 'positive'], ['2 bedr', 'beds were comfortable', 'positive'], ['sofa', 'not comfortable', 'negative'], ['location', 'good', 'positive'], ['doormen', 'nice', 'positive']]

bad first impression The Operator who picks up the phone at the general number gave me the wrong fax number . Then when I called back to inquire , the second person was very curt in correcting me , not only was there no apology , she hung up on me as I was still talking without even a ' good bye ' . This kind of service attitude is simply not acceptable anywhere , let alone a hotel of this level .

vercharged at check out ! The hotel room was fine , rather small but ok . What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate .

I traveled throughout Europe and this was the only hotel that charged me a higher rate .

Good location but small rooms Good location right next to all the shops in the centre of San Farn . The rooms were good but a on the small side .

Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter . In spite of the rate , we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check - in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids . Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids welcome pack at check - in . Truly superior service all around from valet parking to baggage check to front desk .

Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris , I was concerned to choose well . After reading several reviews on the internet , I selected the Hotel D ' Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice . The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was ' at the heart ' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme , Louvre , Pompidou Centre , Pantheon etc . The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright , clean , and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate . All in all , the Hotel D ' Albe surpassed all our expectations , and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit .

Great hotel , good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence , approx 5 mins walk and about 10 - 15 mins to main city centre . We were pleasantly surprised by our room , the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious . Bathroom was clean .

Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam . We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer . The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden , which was perfectly nice and quiet . Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East , for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional , something you don ' t see everywhere . Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well ( which we didnt join since we had other plans ) . Staff , especially porters and concierge , were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans , which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay . All in all , the location can ' t be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff , Pulitzer gets a thumb up !####[['room', 'overlooking the inner garden', 'positive'], ['room', 'perfectly nice', 'positive'], ['room', 'quiet', 'positive'], ['room', 'good size', 'positive'], ['room', 'very ell apointed', 'positive'], ['room', 'functional', 'positive'], ['porters', 'extremely helpful', 'positive'], ['concierge', 'extremely helpful', 'positive'], ['location', "can ' t be beaten", 'positive'], ['Pulitzer', 'uniqueness of the architecture', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['Pulitzer', 'thumb up', 'positive']]

Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont . We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite , we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money , the rooms are huge . We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river . I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had , however , on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill .

A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid : The rate was extremely good ( 90 euros / night , booked about 2 months in advance ) ; included internet , minibar complimentary ; was Exceptionally Clean ; Recently renovated ; Quiet ; Well located ( short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction ; Mayor Square in the other ) ; very friendly .

This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences , cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd , and weddings anyday of the week which means : bottom line the facilities are not available 24 / 7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard . What was once a $ 400 night hotel for the business , elite traveler is now a $ 49 - 79night cheap 4 star ; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline , this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed . Very crowded , very low class . We had business guests with written reservations well in advance , two were bumped out of the hotel ; we were treated rudely , pulled our corporate account .####[['facilities', 'not available 24 / 7', 'negative'], ['pool', 'often closed', 'negative'], ['courtyard', 'often closed', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'now a $ 49 - 79night cheap', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'very disappointed', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'Very crowded', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'very low class', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'two were bumped out', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'treated rudely', 'negative']]

A Wonderful Hotel We stayed for four nights in room number 4 and loved it . The room held up to our expectations from the photos on the hotel ' s website , it was beautifully furnished with antiques , expensive carpets and curtains .

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september . Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF , we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel . It presents itself as a cute boutique hotel which is how it looks on the website , however the reality is not . Room was tiny , deco was average , cleaning was it is minimum levels .

Loved the valentine special offerings I normally do not stay in Dutch hotels as my job puts me up in enough hotels abroad . However my boyfriend treated me to a valentine weekend in Amsterdam . I was impressed , a lovely room looking over the Prinsengracht . Special touches , even rose petals sprinkled over the bed after our dinner . A lavish dinner and a good breakfast the following morning .

Fantastic Stayed over a weekend in feburary , 2008 . Every facet of the experience was excellent ( and also expensive ) . The service was courteous  professional , the rooms were large by european standards and very well appointed . The grounds of the hotel were elegant yet unpretentious .

Lovely place to stay Lovely place to stay . After reading the reviews on tripadvisor , my girl - friend and I decided to go for this hotel . The staff were very helpful with everything our hearts desired ( calling a cab , giving us directions , carrying our bags up to the room and down again when we left ) , the breakfast was a treat , the rooms were very romantic and clean and the location was superb .

Great location and friendly hotel I chose this hotel mainly due to location as I was taking my Mum who can ' t walk so far - but it was a great choice alround . We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful . Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view .

Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews . The hotel is clean , comfortable and the staff are excellent .

in the center of it all . . . The main attraction to this hotel is location / price . . . you are next to three of the main subway lines in Tokyo and can walk to many great restaurants and attractions .

Tiny room with many ants The room wasn ' t available to check - in until late afternoon . Once in the tiny room we discovered it was full of ants .

average at best This hotel has a good location , but not a lot else , it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room , including giving us the key to an occupied room , and keys that did not work . We were then allegedly upgraded , from what I cannot imagine , the room was tiny , and not air conditioned . The continental breakfast was a complete farce , a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom , which had then to be carried back to the bedroom , where there was no where to eat but on the bed .

ideal location excellent location , not knowing the city , we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area , pier 39 , the deals , alcatraz . The hotel was very plush inside , staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile . Our room was fantatic , modern clean and decorated to a very high standard . The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn ' t get to appreciate the facilities .

Nice hotel , uninteresting location This hotel itself and the staff are very adequate but being located in downtown Miami is a hinderance . It is far from the beaches and its pool and health facilities are very small , considering it is in Florida . The surrounding area is undergoing a great deal of building and renovation so currently it is noisy ; I am sure it will improve in the next few years .

Disappointing and watch the final bill I ' ve stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated ( given the price ) I ' ve returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it . I wouldn ' t return to The Clift ; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge / front door staff are all good but that ' s about it . The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen ( and I had a loft suite ) - and for the price other hotels offer more ( no flat screen TV , ineffective air con ) . What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US $ 185 for late checkout without any notification ( I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11 . 00am ) . E mailed the hotel twice - no response and finally had to phone to obtain a refund - which they made immediately but with no apology or explanation .####[['Clift', 'watch the final bill', 'negative'], ['Clift', 'Disappointing', 'negative'], ['Clift', 'bit dated', 'negative'], ['Redwood Bar', 'fun', 'positive'], ['concierge / front door staff', 'all good', 'positive'], ['bathroom', 'smallest', 'negative'], ['flat screen TV', 'no', 'negative'], ['air con', 'ineffective', 'negative'], ['service', 'charged me an additional US $ 185 for late checkout', 'negative'], ['service', 'no response', 'negative'], ['service', 'made immediately', 'positive'], ['service', 'no apology or explanation', 'negative']]
Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location , that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar , and the rudness of the people at the front desk . Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise , and when you only need five minutes to get to any place , you forget the rudness of the front desk staff . The rooms were clean , the breakfast was ok , and remember this , if is clean and has a great location , the restis not important . Will definitely come back here . They have a small restaurant in front openfrom 8 am to 11 pm , with very good food .####[['location', 'Wonderful Choice', 'positive'], ['location', 'such a wonderful', 'positive'], ['front desk', 'rudness', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'noise during the evenings', 'negative'], ['location', 'five minutes to get to any place', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'clean', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'ok', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'definitely come back', 'positive'], ['restaurant', 'small', 'negative'], ['food', 'very good', 'positive']]
Excellent all the way around We always stay at Embassy Suites when we can and this one keeps with the tradition and quality that you come to expect .

IDEAL for large groups . Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30 ' s and 40 ' s . Found it to be a good quality , well run , clean hotel . Staff were all very curteous and welcoming ( even when returning from nights out at 5 . 30AM ) and rooms were clean and adequate . Didn ' t sample the food - plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars within 50 yards . Steps to ( excellent ) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport ( get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T - 10 ticket that allows 10 journeys ) . Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro ' s a day is a bit stiff .####[['hotel', 'IDEAL for large groups', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'good quality', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'well run', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'clean', 'positive'], ['Staff', 'all very curteous', 'positive'], ['Staff', 'welcoming', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'clean', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'adequate', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars within 50 yards', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Metro system are outside the front door', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'definately recommend', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'professionally run place', 'positive'], ['breakfast', "15 Euro ' s a day is a bit stiff ", 'negative']]
Gem in a Non - Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed . I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don ' t know about this place . We got great service , a great view , a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels ( e . g . , the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical / health activities ) . I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them . I can see why - - nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes ( mostly ) of tourists . I want to stay here again .####[['service', 'great', 'positive'], ['hotels', 'not disappointed', 'positive'], ['hotels', 'great view', 'positive'], ['location', 'terrific', 'positive'], ['hotels', 'nice accommodations', 'positive']]

good location , but unorganised Stayed at the hotel Carlton for 1 week in october . The price was reasonable , however we stayed in 3 rooms in that week . We wanted 2 singles , but for 2 nights they were ' unavailable ' so we were moved around rooms with double beds . On one occasion there was a couple at reception complaining that they had 2 single beds when they wanted a double , but we were unable to swap with them . Apart from the trouble with the rooms , the location was fantastic , only a quick walk to union square and the staff were polite and helpful .####[['location', 'good', 'positive'], ['Carlton', 'price was reasonable', 'positive'], ['Carlton', 'unorganised', 'negative'], ['location', 'fantastic', 'positive'], ['location', 'quick walk to union square', 'positive'], ['staff', 'polite', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive']]

Expect the worst A change of plans had us cancel our stay at the Ace Hotel . When we called to cancel - a week before our cancelled trip , we got a cancellation number . A month later , $ 240 . 57 ( Canadian ) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record . Given , we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful , unsympathetic and snobby ! Shame on them for being in the service industry .

Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed . Our room was a really good size and very comfortable . Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee , it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10 : 30am . Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs , bacon , toast etc . We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again .####[['Bassano', 'Quiet', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'comfortable', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'not disappointed', 'positive'], ['room', 'really good size', 'positive'], ['room', 'very comfortable', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'quiet', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'perfect for some lazy mornings', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'breakfast is served until a very civilised 10 : 30am', 'positive'], ['Breakfast', 'very comprehensive', 'positive'], ['buffet', 'great cold', 'positive'], ['buffet', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'very friendly and helpful', 'positive'], ['Bassano', 'definitely stay again', 'positive']]

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week ( departed 16 / 8 / 06 ) . The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling .

Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you ' d go to if you want a really upscale , romantic place to stay . BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam . It ' s a two minute walk to the Dam Square , 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam .

The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean , spacious modern rooms . The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city .

Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of . Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation , the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel , which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare . We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn ' t get much satisfaction .

agree with " do not stay here " This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn ' t give it two . A hint to future guests : if you have a problem , it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations . They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it . They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns .

we like the St Francis This is a lovely hotel with a sense ot charm and history . However it is a bit dated in places , ( corridors and rooms ) , however it is really in a great location , right overlooking Union Square , right in the midst of it all , and close to shops , restaurants etc . we were on our honey moon so they gave us a special room which was really quite big and nicely furnished . the champagne mojitos in the bar were pretty excellent too .####[['St Francis', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['St Francis', 'sense ot charm and history', 'positive'], ['St Francis', 'bit dated', 'negative'], ['location', 'great', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'bit dated', 'negative'], ['location', 'close to shops , restaurants', 'positive'], ['location', 'right overlooking Union Square', 'positive'], ['St Francis', 'gave us a special room', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'really quite big', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'nicely furnished', 'positive'], ['champagne mojitos', 'pretty excellent too', 'positive']]
above average international blah hotel This is a big , beige international hotel . That said , it ' s quite good at it .

Poor Guest Services Operator Stayed at hotel for post - operation recovery . Telephone did not work in the room . Operator wrongly misdirected friends family as well as doctor that I did not want to receive any phone calls .

Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive , superb location very close to station , air - conditioned rooms , lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price ! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax , a 10 % tax that everyone has to pay . Although it ' s possible for non - Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $ 300 , that doesn ' t apply to services .

Great location , excellent value We stayed 3 nights in the Royal Magda for during half term and booked a double and a large double with sofa bed for our 3 children ( 415 and 416 ) .

Great for our short break Nice place at a really decent price for proper Hong Kong hotel ( we booked through a thai website , great deal ) . It is not in centre of town but is 2 seconds from a tube line or you can do what we did every day for fun and get the trams that run all the way into the city .

The hosts we helpful and attentive at all times without being pushy ! ! !

Great location , nice rooms Located a couple blocks from Union Sq and right next to great shopping the Parc 55 was perfect for us .

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia . The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted , but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations . Not the best news for our daughters , who were eager to swim after the flight ! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door , but whilst better than nothing , this was not terribly convenient . The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd , but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul .####[['staff', 'Wonderful', 'positive'], ['staff', 'cannot be faulted', 'positive'], ['pool', 'closed for renovations', 'negative'], ['Regent', 'arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door', 'positive'], ['pool', 'not terribly convenient', 'negative'], ['Regent', 'offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd', 'positive'], ['Regent', 'showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul ', 'negative']]

Pleasantly surprised ! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate , so I wasn ' t expecting much . The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano , or later in the night , the jazz quartet . My room was very large , my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old ( it took a long time for the hot water ) . Otherwise this place is a gem and a nice change of pace from the cookie - cutter chains .####[['hotel', 'beautiful', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Pleasantly surprised', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'ridicously low rate', 'positive'], ['concierge', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['bar', 'wonderful place to relax', 'positive'], ['room', 'very large', 'positive'], ['room', 'plumbing is still very old', 'negative'], ['hotel', 'gem and a nice change of pace', 'positive'], ['room', 'took a long time for the hot water', 'negative']]
#4 Hotel in Los Angeles ? ? ? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights . Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms . Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like . The carpeting was stained , there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub . Granted the location is good , however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt .####[['clerk', 'upgraded to a suite', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'newly refurnished', 'positive'], ['bathroom', 'holes and cracks all over', 'negative'], ['carpeting', 'stained', 'negative'], ['tub', 'large black mark', 'negative'], ['location', 'good', 'positive']]
Great Hotel , Great location Travelled with my wife and two friends to New York to see the St Patricks day parade . We found the staff very helpful and pleasant . Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed ! ! We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great . For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast , be early it gets very busy . The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state , 5th Avenue , Grand Central , Chrysler Building , Times Square etc all within a few minute walk .

really disappointed I can not believe this hotel has such rating stay away from it , I think it deserve one star the most . The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it , they charge you for compelementry coffee , and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port .

Great hotel , great service , great location ! My family of four , including two teenage boys stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 5 nights and really enjoyed our stay . The location is excellent , the rooms , although fairly small , were certainly big enough for the four of us and were well maintained and very nicely decorated .

Great Customer Service . . . Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to ' overbooking ' . This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night . The next day the staff were extremely apologetic and moved me to a Hyde Park view room . Overall , very impressed with the service . The rooms were immaculate . Would definitely recommend this Hotel if you have some spare cash to spend on accommodation .####[['Customer Service', 'Great', 'positive'], ['Customer Service', 'placed into the wrong room type', 'negative'], ['staff', 'extremely apologetic', 'positive'], ['staff', 'moved me to a Hyde Park view room', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very impressed', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'immaculate', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'definitely recommend', 'positive']]
WE LOVED IT . Berlin was the start of our Europe trip and the Westin was a great start to our holiday . Without doubt when in Berlin we will try to stay here again . The location is perfect ( a few minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag ) , the heavenly beds are heavenly , the buffet breakfast is superb and the quality of the hotel far exceeded our expectations . We were there for 3 nights in February and with limited time location is so important - and this hotel was the perfect choice .####[['Westin', 'LOVED', 'positive'], ['Westin', 'great start', 'positive'], ['location', 'perfect', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'beds are heavenly', 'positive'], ['buffet breakfast', 'superb', 'positive'], ['Westin', 'far exceeded our expectations', 'positive'], ['Westin', 'perfect choice', 'positive']]
PB We had a Fabulous time ! ! We brought our 2 small children with us and the hotel staff was very accomadating . The rooms were gorgeous with all the amenities . But the best part was the Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , hot choclate , and cold milk every night . This was complimentary and WONDERFUL .

Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles ( check in delayed by half an hour , water pressure ) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service . Interiors are very well designed , minimal being the key word . I ' d go back there as the location is perfect , we walked everywhere and didn ' t need to take the tube at all ! One highlight : the breakfast ! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices , cooked brekfast with tortillas , eggs , bacon , etc is definitely worth it !####[['location', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['staff', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['staff', 'great understanding', 'positive'], ['customer service', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'Interiors are very well designed', 'positive'], ['location', 'perfect', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'definitely worth', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'huge buffet', 'positive']]
Recent Upgrade I stay at this hotel regularly for business and pleasure . It is in a great location , right next to Chinatown , across the road from the Sydney Entertainment Centre and a short walk from Darling Harbour . They have recently renovated their bar / bistro and have also started to upgrade rooms . While it is not in the most glamorous part of the city it is well worth a visit .####[['location', 'great', 'positive'], ['location', 'right next to Chinatown', 'positive'], ['bar / bistro', 'recently renovated', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'also started to upgrade', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'Recent Upgrade', 'positive']]
Recommended , but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online . I ' m sure this hotel is fine for vacationers : the rooms are ok ( especially the kitchenettes ) , the location is pretty good , and the staff are helpful . However , I don ' t recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer . The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm , and the wireless internet mostly non - existent ( at least while I was staying ) . It just isn ' t worth it .####[['hotel', 'Recommended', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'fine', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'ok', 'positive'], ['location', 'pretty good', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'lighting in the rooms is even dimmer', 'negative'], ['wireless internet', 'mostly non - existent', 'negative'], ['hotel', "just isn ' t worth", 'negative']]
More like a Motel 6 than Hyatt We were there for 9 nights . The hotel smelled musty the rooms where small .

There are better places in NOLA Good conference rooms for large group . But the hotel can not handle it when it comes to house keeping . The bar was really bad .

great everything Booked this hotel through Last Minute . com when my other hotel booking was in euros and needed a better deal . This hotel was first class , on arrival at reception got served immediately given all the info I needed with maps and details of trips and buses . room was very clean , the bed was huge , the buffet breakfast was brilliant and catered for every taste . The hotel was a 5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port , with regular buses and a metro stop outside . Ended up walking everywhere as the sights are not far apart , a brilliant weekend , thanks####[['hotel', 'great', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'first class', 'positive'], ['reception', 'served immediately', 'positive'], ['room', 'very clean', 'positive'], ['bed', 'huge', 'positive'], ['buffet breakfast', 'brilliant', 'positive'], ['buffet breakfast', 'catered for every taste', 'positive'], ['hotel', '5 min stroll from the Ramblas and Port', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'sights are not far apart', 'positive']]
Bargain , excellent accomodations Our family of four stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza in Florence during March 2006 . We were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and the stylish modern furnishings ( bathroom as well ) . Staff was pleasant and very knowledgable about surrounding area and history . Excellent location within walking distance of the train station and hotel parking ( reasonable daily rate OF $ 13 . 00 US ) .

If you want the experince of a private club in London this is it The 41 is an absolute gem , its cosy with very attentive genuinely friendly staff . It feels as though you are in a private house with a gathering of old friendsThe hotel rooms are small so if you like oceans of space this hotel is not for you but they have every possible personal desire in the room includng ipod speakers , personal robes - let your imagination roam ! Its perfectly siutated opposite Buckingham Palace and undoubtedely one of the best hotels in London .####[['The 41', 'absolute gem', 'positive'], ['The 41', 'cosy', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very attentive genuinely friendly', 'positive'], ['The 41', 'eels as though you are in a private house', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'small', 'negative'], ['The 41', 'perfectly siutated opposite Buckingham Palace', 'positive'], ['The 41', 'undoubtedely one of the best', 'positive']]
Intimate Hotel with Great Service The Chesterfield Mayfair remains my favourite hotel in London . The location is fantastic . The hotel is intimate and very British .

Gran Ronda Good Location The Gran Ronda is well placed , it ' s on a road that runs parallel to La Rambla . You can walk to the North end off La Rambla via a well lit side street within 10 mins .

The Best We normally stay at 5 star hotels and this is a 4 star . We were also a bit sceptical when we saw the pictures of the bright rooms on the web but this was the best hotel .

really liked it We stayed in December just for 1 night , but I liked the location , the room ( great bed ) and the staff . The restaurant was very good . It is joined by the skyway to 2 rather pricey malls , but is was good not to have to go outside to shop . Legal Seafood is in the mall , Yummy ! I would stay again in the summer as it is not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around .####[['NULL', 'really liked', 'positive'], ['location', 'liked', 'positive'], ['room', 'great bed', 'positive'], ['staff', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['restaurant', 'very good', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'stay again', 'positive'], ['location', 'not far from Fenway and lots to see walking around', 'positive']]
Excellent accomodations . Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace . It is a lovely hotel deserving of it ' s 5 star rating . The employees were very helpful , very accomodating . Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money , asking about areas we wanted to visit , ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants , even getting a massage . This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous .####[['Loong Palace', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['Loong Palace', 'lovely', 'positive'], ['Loong Palace', '5 star rating', 'positive'], ['employees', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['employees', 'very accomodating', 'positive'], ['Loong Palace', 'bit out of downtown Beijing', 'negative']]
I loved everything The building is fantastic , the hotel is wonderful , true luxury at affordable prices ( I looked for , and found , a special offer on the hotel website ) . The bed is awfully confortable , you have complimentary bar , full of refreshments and some snacks , the toiletries are by Lanvin . The staff is very polite . The location is in front of the railway station , and short walking distance from the Dam .####[['hotel', 'loved everything', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'building is fantastic', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'wonderful', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'true luxury', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'affordable prices', 'positive'], ['bed', 'awfully confortable', 'positive'], ['bar', 'complimentary', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very polite', 'positive'], ['location', 'front of the railway station', 'positive'], ['location', 'short walking distance from the Dam', 'positive']]

The staff make this hotel truly awesome ! We decided to visit the wonderful island of Bali for our Honeymoon in October and after scouring the internet for the best all inclusive resorts there chose to stay at the Melia Benoa hotel . The staff at the hotel were simply superb ; Mendrin , Pardi and Augustini were the highlights providing service with a smile 24 / 7 ! Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front , with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants . Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options , imported spirits , late check out and free laundry service ! Also had a good tour of the island with Wayan - recommended although don ' t forget to take extra cash to buy souvenirs and to get into the tourist attractions !####[['Melia Benoa', 'truly awesome', 'positive'], ['staff', 'simply superb', 'positive'], ['Mendrin , Pardi and Augustini', 'highlights providing service with a smile 24 / 7', 'positive'], ['location', 'Great', 'positive'], ['location', 'right on the beach front', 'positive'], ['facilities', 'superb', 'positive'], ['pool', 'never crowded', 'positive'], ['pool bar', 'never crowded', 'positive'], ['restaurants', 'choice of 3 fully functional', 'positive']]
The views are just to die for ! ! ! Stayed here for a long week - end , November 4th - 8th , in Room 308 and the views from that room were marvellous , the Louvre , the Musee D ' Orsay and the Eiffel Tower and we overlooked the Tuilleries , these views were even better at night when Paris was lit - up ! ! !

Never stay here ! Whew , this place was bad . The pool had such a scum on it that I wouldn ' t let my kids in it , the whole place smelled , and in the middle of the night drunken guests called my room and made obscene comments . I was literally scared of this place , and when I reported it to the desk , they just said they couldn ' t stop the calls because they were coming from within the building .

Over rated For the price you pay , make sure you get one of the better rooms . When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade ( basically all the cars going up can see you ) . I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later , I got the one I wanted , with a bit of a view for the same price . There ' s nothing extraordinary about this hotel , the gym is quaint , the rooms are small , the bathroom is actually really big , it was about 1 / 2 the size of the bedroom . . . the restaurant is pretty cool .####[['hotel', 'Over rated For the price you pa', 'neutral'], ['hotel', 'nothing extraordinary', 'neutral'], ['gym', 'quaint', 'negative'], ['rooms', 'small', 'negative'], ['bathroom', 'actually really big', 'positive'], ['restaurant', 'pretty cool ', 'positive']]
