Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me . I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in . The staff are very helpful , professional and friendly . The decor is very tasteful , the location is great , the price is very good value , the mini bar was very reasonably priced , the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel . I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel .####[['hotel', 'more like a 4 star', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['staff', 'professional', 'positive'], ['staff', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'decor is very tasteful', 'positive'], ['location', 'great', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'price is very good value', 'positive'], ['mini bar', 'very reasonably priced', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'exceptionally clean', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'very quiet', 'positive'], ['location', 'such a centrally located', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'certainly return', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'recommend', 'positive']]

A really nice hotel We stayed for three nights from May 28th and were upgraded to a harbour view room with a free breakfast thrown in ! The room was spotless and the staff could not be faulted . Nothing much more to add as previous rewiewers have already mentioned the close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station , bus and tram stops etc . One thing that did concern me about Hong Kong was the air pollution , we actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes whilst we were in the swimming pool 32 floors up !####[['hotel', 'really nice', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'upgraded to a harbour view room', 'positive'], ['room', 'spotless', 'positive'], ['staff', 'not be faulted', 'neutral'], ['hotel', 'close proximity to Tin Hau MTR station', 'positive'], ['swimming pool', 'actually caught a whiff of diesel fumes', 'negative'], ['breakfast', 'free', 'positive']]
Good Service but Loud The location is quite convienent with many good restaurants in the neighborhood . The staff was very friendly and very helpful .

Superb Hotel Me and my wife stayed in the Intercontinental in Singapore for 2 nights in our Honeymoon Trip around Asia and Pacific . The Staff is excellent as well as the service and the Breakfest Buffet ( fantastic ! ! ) . The room is large with all new and modern amenities .

City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home . The avenue is about a ten minute walk from the station and allowed us to leave our luggage all day so that we could go round the city long before we could check in . It is within 5 minutes of Dam square and really well placed on one of the main tram routes . The rooms were small but clean and all of the staff really friendly . bar prices were very reasonable for a hotel .####[['City Convenience', 'ten minute walk from the station', 'positive'], ['City Convenience', 'allowed us to leave our luggage all day', 'positive'], ['City Convenience', 'within 5 minutes of Dam square', 'positive'], ['City Convenience', 'really well placed', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'small', 'negative'], ['rooms', 'clean', 'positive'], ['staff', 'really friendly', 'positive'], ['bar', 'prices were very reasonable', 'positive']]

Great choice ! Our family of 8 people stayed 3 nights and loved the friendly , homey , feeling of the hotel .

Good value weekend break When we stayed , they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money . We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel . Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times .

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel , or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service , a very modern and up to date decor , large and comfortable rooms , all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops . The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11 . 00am just in case we ' d had a late night , a sun terrace on the roof with a ( small ) pool and gymnasium , although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife .

Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel , three great pools to choose from . My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials , we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade , 75 $ resort credit ,  complimentary bottle of wine .

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton - family properties , and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay , it was hardly worth the price paid . Good points : very friendly staff , and terrific restaurantBad points : the room was dated - old rundown furniture , warped bathtub , stained bedding . I was only offered a double - queen suite in the main building , which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements . Overall , I ' ve had much better accomodations at Embassy Suites and Doubletrees in the hilton family .

Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown , with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links . Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean . Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit , and walls were on the thin side , but these were minor issues . Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good . Good food nearby at Changs ( in Westlake ) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place .

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment , but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes , and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes , which improved the whole situation . The hotel is really quite plush , the rooms had everything we needed , and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free ! The staff were very helpful , and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go . The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others , but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day , and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water , wasn ' t to be turned down . It is definitely a hotel I would visit again , particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years .####[['Hotel', 'Fine', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'bit of a disappointment', 'negative'], ['Hotel', 'walk to the sea in 10 minutes', 'neutral'], ['Hotel', 'really quite plush', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'everything we neede', 'positive'], ['fridge', 'impressed', 'positive'], ['staff', 'replaced daily free', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['staff', 'knowledgeable', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'discontent', 'negative'], ['Menu del Dia', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'visit again', 'positive']]

There ' s two small swimming pools with astro turf , the room view was of the next building , the food in the hotel restaurant as the hotel itself was uninspiring . Threre ' s nothing really bad , just all second rate , and simply a disappointing experience to stay here . I wouldn ' t want to stay here here again nor can I recommend this place to anyone .####[['location', 'good', 'positive'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'close by the Honolulu Zoo', 'positive'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'price is one of the lowest', 'positive'], ['swimming pools', 'small', 'neutral'], ['room', 'view was of the next building', 'negative'], ['food', 'uninspiring', 'negative'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'nothing really bad', 'positive'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'just all second rate', 'neutral'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'simply a disappointing experience', 'negative'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', "wouldn ' t want to stay here here again", 'negative'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', "isn ' t great", 'negative'], ['Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki', 'nor can I recommend', 'negative']]

Bargain and convenient location For years , I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only . The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room . The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front . if , like me , you juts need a place to sleep and shower , the beds could be better but the water has always been hot , and it is a bargain ! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here , but I am barely in the room , so why pay more ? I will be spending my 3rd vacation there in 2 weeks .####[['location', 'convenient', 'positive'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'Bargain', 'positive'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'tired', 'negative'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'use a major update', 'negative'], ['location', 'fabulous', 'positive'], ['room', 'ocean view', 'positive'], ['location', 'convenient to everything', 'positive'], ['location', 'bus stops right in front', 'positive'], ['beds', 'could be better', 'negative'], ['water', 'always been hot', 'positive'], ['The Queen Kapiolani', 'bargain', 'positive']]
Don ' t arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor . I had a reservation for a room with a large bed . When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds . They did find a room with one large bed , in the smoking rooms , but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby . For 140 Euro , I expected a lot more .

Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers . the room was perfect , great space which is unusual for New York , beautiful view , excellent location . The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor . The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly . But the reception area is really nice .

harming ! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed . We had room # 11 , which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn , but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast . We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by . The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful .

Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming , so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there . The lobby is absolutely exquisite , and the staff were warm and welcoming . The rooms didn ' t quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side . However , the bathrooms were larger than most I ' ve seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean . I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a pricier hotel for a weekend stay in Boston , close to many opportunities for great shopping , entertainment , and activities .####[['Fairmont Copley', 'Lovely', 'positive'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'grandiose', 'positive'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'charming', 'positive'], ['lobby', 'absolutely exquisite', 'positive'], ['staff', 'warm', 'positive'], ['staff', 'welcoming', 'positive'], ['rooms', "didn ' t quite measure up", 'negative'], ['rooms', 'smaller', 'negative'], ['bathrooms', 'larger', 'positive'], ['bathrooms', 'decor was stylish', 'positive'], ['bathrooms', 'clean', 'positive'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'definitely recommend', 'positive'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'close to many opportunities', 'positive'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'pricier', 'negative'], ['Fairmont Copley', 'thrilled', 'positive']]

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days ( before going back to work  reality ) . We were in the first group to leave the ship , so we arrived at the hotel at 9 : 30am ! The staff couldn ' t have been friendlier . They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits , and we sunned at the beach  had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2 : 30pm . We especially enjoyed the following : our very large and comfortable tower room , uncrowded beach , health club facilities , and good restaurants within walking distance .

Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views . When we got there , 3 / 4 of the view was of the blank brick wall of the adjoinging building but they still considered and charged as a water view . When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it .

Great Area in Boston We had to take our son to Boston Children ' s Hospital and this hotel is extremely close by . The amenities of this hotel are great and accomodating especially after a long day in the hospital .

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month . Tastefully decorated , spacious and clean rooms , friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room !

Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site , and the hotel lived up to expectations ! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help . We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children , but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around , so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room ! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food ! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again , having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable .####[['hotel', 'Loved', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'lived up to expectations', 'positive'], ['staff', 'Very very friendly', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'safe', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'comfortable', 'positive'], ['Breakfast', 'great', 'positive'], ['food', 'loved', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'definitely recommend', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'would stay again', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'lots of CCTV cameras around', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'great adventure', 'positive'], ['staff', 'couldnt do enough to help', 'positive']]
Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington . The hotel is conveniently located ( about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro ) , the staff is friendly and accomodating , and the suites are comfortable and well laid out . The 32 ' ' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus . Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items ( eggs , omelets , etc ) and an evening cocktail reception , both of which are fantastic .

Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels , so Laguna had to meet the expectations , and mostly it did . My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool .

Personally . . . They have an excellent personal service , I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included , because I had to pay 12 euros per head . Apart from that , I loved the room . Although it was on the 3rd floor it was a quiet room and the location is perfect for shoppers !

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews . Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar , were helpful , friendly and entertaining . Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated . The view alone is worth the visit ! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I ' ve visited . Oh and the spa . . . if you can fit it in do so , the perfect end to a great island vacation .####[['hotel', 'Great', 'positive'], ['Dominic', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['Hiriam and Rodney', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['Hiriam and Rodney', 'entertaining', 'positive'], ['room', 'little small', 'negative'], ['room', 'very clean', 'positive'], ['room', 'updated', 'positive'], ['room', 'view alone is worth the visit', 'positive'], ['Restaurants', 'little pricey', 'negative'], ['cocktails', 'little pricey', 'negative'], ['Restaurants', 'no worse', 'neutral'], ['cocktails', 'no worse', 'neutral'], ['spa', 'perfect end', 'positive']]
Absolutely brilliant . . . Myself and my girlfriend stayed 3 nights at this hotel just recently . I can highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the brilliant city of Barcelona . It is a two minute walk to La Ramblas and only a little further to some of the main attractions ( such as Gaudi buildings ) . The staff were excellent , the breakfast was good and the room was perfect .

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights . Despite the other reviews which might scare you off , we found the staff friendly and very responsive , room was clean and in good shape , and only a few very minor issues . Whenever we called , someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less ( e . g . extra blankets and pillows ) . This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt . Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore . About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior - - - though there were plenty of grab bars .####[['the Elizabeth', 'Very acceptable and friendly choice', 'positive'], ['staff', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['staff', 'very responsive', 'positive'], ['room', 'clean', 'positive'], ['room', 'good shape', 'positive'], ['the Elizabeth', 'conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt .

Great Resort , Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites , pools and golf , but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation .

Even with a Hotwire booked reservation , the staff honored my platinum Starwood membership and upgraded me to a huge suite ( three of us got upgraded separately ) .

Good Hotel Just returned from Hong Kong , where I resided five days at the Langham Place , inspired by the reviews on this site . I decided to stay at this hotel not only because of the overall favorably opinions but mainly because of the rapport between quality and price , which turned out to be excellent . For a good hotel with great amenities and services , it was reasonable . I am not a fan of huge hotels of this type , but I found that the service was maintained on all levels . I loved the spa and the outdoor pool which was big enough with an amazing view .####[['Hotel', 'Good', 'positive'], ['amenities', 'great', 'positive'], ['services', 'great', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'reasonable', 'positive'], ['services', 'maintained on all levels', 'positive'], ['the spa', 'loved', 'positive'], ['outdoor pool', 'big enough', 'positive'], ['outdoor pool', 'amazing view', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'turned out to be excellent', 'positive']]
A Steal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Compared to the congestion , noise , cheeseball tourists and double rates at the Caribe Hilton and the San Juan Hotel , this place is great ! Centrally located , friendly staff , and quiet rooms . If you want to eat , you can walk next door to the Hilton and use them for their restaurants , then walk across the street for ice cream . FREE internet service ands a great pool .####[['Hotel', 'great', 'positive'], ['Hotel', 'Centrally located', 'positive'], ['staff', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'quiet', 'positive'], ['internet service', 'FREE', 'positive'], ['pool', 'great', 'positive']]
Great location across Arno River Hotel Silla is a great find across the river from all the main sights in Florence . Their customer service is top notch , they are always willing to answer questions , recommend a restaurant or reserve an entrance to a museum or tourist attraction . They provide free internet access in the lobby , and their breakfast is terrific ! Also , enjoy a bottle or glass of wine outside on the terrace in the evening . It ' s generally quiet , but be aware that on a weekend evening , it can get loud as there are a few restaurants  bars on the block where locals party . We had a great stay , and would return to Hotel Silla again .####[['Hotel Silla', 'great find across the river', 'positive'], ['location', 'Great', 'positive'], ['customer service', 'top notch', 'positive'], ['internet access', 'free', 'positive'], ['breakfast', 'terrific', 'positive'], ['Hotel Silla', 'generally quiet', 'positive'], ['Silla', 'return', 'positive'], ['Hotel Silla', 'great stay', 'positive'], ['Hotel Silla', 'get loud', 'negative']]
Wonderful stay ! ! We stayed for 7 nights in the condos . Staff was very nice . Our rooms had great view of Waikiki Beach .

Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features , some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat . However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff . Minus points were the size of the bedroom ( small ) ; a sliding door on the bathroom that didn ' t have any pretence at privacy ; high bar prices ( $ 14 for a glass of wine ) and exorbitant parking charges ( $ 37 per day ) when there were public facilities on the same block ( for $ 24 a day . ) Overall , good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back . Darrin , the bar steward would make me want to go back though , just for the entertainment value . He was a scream !####[['hotel', 'new', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'pleasant stay', 'positive'], ['staff', 'particularly firendly and helpful', 'positive'], ['bedroom', 'small', 'negative'], ['bathroom', "didn ' t have any pretence at privacy", 'negative'], ['bar', 'high', 'negative'], ['parking', 'exorbitant', 'negative'], ['Darrin', 'make me want to go back though', 'positive'], ['hotel', 'entertainment value', 'positive']]

Elevator Safety Issues ! ! All three of the south bank of elevators malfunctioned the entire four days we were there ! One group of guests was stuck in elevator # 3 for over an hour and a half .

Great value , friendly staff This was the first stop of our honeymoon , and we very much enjoyed our stay at Amstelzicht .

Great Location Shabby Room Although the Ambassador was well located , had a pleasant and helpful staff , and good food service , I will probably not stay there again .

a terrible experience The worst nightmare I ' ve ever lived . My wife got a severe food poison for which we ' ve spent 3 nights in a hospital in punta cana .

From what I could see , other more expensive hotels near the area probably can ' t claim to have the view that we did .

Great Hotel This is a great hotel , on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city .

Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore , my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location . We were not disappointed . Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $ 70 before taxes is tough to beat . A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value . Our only knock would be that there was no A / C , which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun .####[['Moore', 'not disappointed', 'positive'], ['Moore', 'tough to beat', 'positive'], ['room', 'clean', 'positive'], ['room', 'partial view of the sound adds to the value', 'positive'], ['A / C', 'only knock', 'negative']]
Heed noise warnings ! I want to echo earlier reviews : Da House centrally located , inexpensive , and beautiful . The staff are friendly and helpful . It is , however , LOUD . There are interior rooms that are quieter , but they do not have windows that open to the outside . Da House is not for people who want to go to sleep before 3 am .####[['Da House', 'centrally located', 'positive'], ['Da House', 'inexpensive', 'positive'], ['Da House', 'beautiful', 'positive'], ['staff', 'friendly', 'positive'], ['staff', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'quieter', 'positive'], ['rooms', 'LOUD', 'negative'], ['Da House', 'go to sleep before 3 am', 'negative']]
I love this hotel This hotel is fabulous . The location is great , the staff are lovely , helpful and so keen to help and make your stay memorable . The rooms are nicely decorated and i like the quirkly design which follow through from the rooms to the lobby area . I loved the lobby , it was cosy with the fire going and felt like someone ' s living room rather than a hotel lobby ! ! The free wine for an hour every evening was nice , you got to see everyone in the hotel and have a chat if you felt like it ! ! There are endless great resturants in San Francisco , really spolit for choice , especially if you like seafood ! !

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used ( think they may have gone out of business now as can ' t find them any more ) to the Hotel Piet Hein . When we arrived thought nice hotel , only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel ' s annex which was a few doors down the same street . Absolute nightmare of a room , up three flights of very steep stairs , room very dirty , ripped curtains , mould in bathroom , stained carpets , etc . Didn ' t get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in . In short , not somewhere I would reccomend . That said , things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago , but beware when booking , make sure its the main hotel which is really nice .####[['room', 'Absolute nightmare', 'negative'], ['Annex', 'very steep stairs', 'negative'], ['room', 'very dirty', 'negative'], ['room', 'ripped curtains', 'negative'], ['bathroom', 'mould', 'negative'], ['room', 'stained carpets', 'negative'], ['room', "Didn ' t get our own key to the door", 'negative'], ['Annex', 'not somewhere I would reccomend', 'negative']]
Uber - fantastic - hotel Great weekend getaway to the Commonwealth . Fantastic bed , linens , pillows - - could have slept until check out .

Brought home bedbugs Beautiful setting , but vast hotel and a little impersonal . Okay beach on a separate island that you have to take a boat to ( free , every half hour ) .

Heavenly stay My stay at the Westin Park Central truly was Heavenly . I can ' t remember a better nights sleep away from home .

Start Spreading the Muse . . . We stayed at the Muse a few weeks ago ( Feb 08 ) . It was a fantastic experience . The staff was great , the room was spacious ( by NY standards ) and the bed was very , very comfortable .

Mass toerism After one week staying at Meridien Nirwana we moved for another week to Melia . As we arrived we were surprised by all the loudly people laying at the pool and the beach .

Excellent Location I stayed at this hotel for pleasure using Marriott Reward points for 2 nights . The hotel is ideally situated in the Circular Quay area , only 3 minutes from the City Train stop from the airport . Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney , including the Rocks area , Harbor Bridge , shopping , Rocks market , and ferries to Manly and everywhere else . The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area . The room provided was better than average for Marriott , with all amenities and nice shower .####[['Location', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['Location', 'ideally situated in the Circular Quay area', 'positive'], ['Location', 'within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants', 'positive'], ['room', 'better than average for Marriott', 'positive'], ['amenities', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['room', 'nice shower', 'positive']]
great location Location is great , near corner of Orchard and Scotts . Club lounge is nice , although no hot offering at breakfast , which although ok for my wife , expect a hot offering at Grand Hyatt Grand Clubs ( best is in HK ) .

Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again . If your looking for a clean room , near Bourbon Street , friendly staff , at a good price - this is the place .

Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it . Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it ' s a good standard hotel it ' s no longer that great . Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that . Now seems full of coch parties , meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners .

Location , Location , Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters , this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms ( new plasma TV ' s ) at an incredibly good price . Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring . Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones , etc . but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay .

ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance / house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day .

Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny , barely lit , musty and just unbearable .

It ' ll be great when it ' s finished ! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel . We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed , the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom . Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room . The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there .

Not for me Didn ' t really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities , however we knew this before checking in . The room we had was very basic , had no safe , was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel , were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed .
