Immaculate , vintage hotel with personable staff - - worth the price This impeccably - restored , 1880 ' s era hotel is clean and quiet and wonderfully located in a popular historic district near the waterfront . Our train was delayed and the night desk clerk cheerfully greeted us at 3 AM and even held the door for us . The breakfast , including hard - boiled eggs , various cereals and fresh batter with waffle - maker , was delicious . It is a bit pricey but we would stay there again in a heartbeat and recommend it highly .####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([2], [9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS'), ([2], [23], 'POS'), ([2], [25], 'POS'), ([2], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([44, 45, 46], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'POS'), ([62], [81], 'POS'), ([62], [81], 'POS'), ([2], [86, 87], 'NEG'), ([2], [98, 99, 100], 'POS')]
Good Hotel is at good location to shops and foods . The hotel staff were fantastic , friendly , informative and helpful all the time . The room is very cosy but not very big , anyway that is the normal size of hotel in Hong Kong .

Hotel Casci Hotel Casci is a small family run hotel in Florence , well located and convenient to the Duomo and other sites . The staff was a joy to deal with , no request was too small or too much trouble for them . Their restaurant suggestions were wonderful and their customer service was excellent .

We spent five nights and highly recommend this hotel to future travelers .####[([0, 1], [13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS'), ([25], [28, 29, 30, 31], 'POS'), ([25], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], 'POS'), ([53], [55], 'POS'), ([25], [46, 47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([71], [70], 'POS'), ([0, 1], [78, 79], 'POS')]
small small small This is a hotel where you can stay if you never have been to the city before and plan on getting up and going from morning till night . If not , don ' t attempt it .

wonderful hotel We loved our stay at the chesterfield in late July 2005 . Thoughtful concierge helped plan a theater trip , including dinner . rooms were decent sized and nicely equipped . Lovely breakfast with nice staff ( included in our rate ) . good location a few blocks from tube and buses . the street itslef was quiet , but there were restaurants nearby in Shepherd market ( many of them open sunday night , which we did not find in other nearby neighborhoods ) .

not what I expected The hotel was clean , the view was nice and the location right in front of Shinagawa station perfect but the room was cramped even though we went for the upgraded double .

Loved the Dumont We have just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia Dumont . We stayed in a wonderful 1 bedroom suite , we had decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth the extra money , the rooms are huge . We asked for a room on a high floor and was allocated a room on the 28th floor with a lovely view over the river . I cannot find anything to complain about other than receiving a bill for minibar items which we had not had , however , on booking out this was dealt with and the charge was deducted from our bill .

Lived up to Expectations There is no point repeating the comments on other reviews . The hotel is clean , comfortable and the staff are excellent .

Stayed at the Kimberly June 24 - 27 I had a confirmed reservation made two months before arriving for a 2 bedr , 2 bath suite - upon arrival was told I was being upgraded to a 3 bedr suite - how nice ! Only problem was 3 bedr had no living room and no full kitchen and we needed those rooms for our group of 6 . They moved us to 2 one bedr suites across the hall from each other - beds were comfortable , pull out sofa not comfortable - you could feel the springs - good location , nice doormen , and I would ask for terrace with a view - our first 3 bedr upgrade had a beat up looking terrace and looked into another bulding - depressing - other than the reservation being not what I wanted we all said we ' d stay again -####[([3], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([3], [41, 42], 'POS'), ([48], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], 'NEG'), ([20, 21], [83, 84, 85], 'POS'), ([89], [90, 91], 'NEG'), ([100], [99], 'POS'), ([103], [102], 'POS')]

Be wary ! Stayed for four nights on a business trip and was impressed with the size of the room etc . However , I found there was some rather foul stains ( females staying along do not make marks like that ) on the duvet cover , which obviously had not been washed - told the hotel staff and it was rectified but I received no apology etc .

Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights ' stay at the NY Palace , I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC . My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality , the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated , with a beautiful view of St . Patrick Cathedral on top of those , the use of the lounge was a great boon for us , supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant , friendly and civilized surroundings , the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not - so - friendly city as New York . Also , unlike what was written in a previous preview , we were there with our five yrs old child ( having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level ) and he was always made to feel at home ( I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there ) .

Gran Ronda Good Location The Gran Ronda is well placed , it ' s on a road that runs parallel to La Rambla . You can walk to the North end off La Rambla via a well lit side street within 10 mins .

Great location for an Amsterdam stopover The other reviews are right , the hotel is close to everything - trains , RLD , restaurants , shopping , etc . Reasonably clean - not spotless .

Great hotel for a city break We stayed at the Residence Inn from 6 - 10 June 2008 for 4 nights . We had a 2 bed suite on the 14th floor which had everything you need even had large dishwasher and a huge fridge / freezer which came in handy for ice cream as there was an heatwave on whilst we were there . Could not fault it at all . Hotel is in a great location , plenty of resturants nearby , not too far to the train station . I think this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when doing a city break .

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month . Tastefully decorated , spacious and clean rooms , friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room ! The location is ideal as it is close to everything you could possibly want to do in the Big Apple and there really is no need to take cabs as the subway is minutes away .

I bit expensive but worth it The hotel is located right in the Ostbahnhof so very good location for getting around the city and out of the city .

Maxwell has the old San Francisco charm I personally prefer the charm of the Maxwell over the institutional feel of a big , new hotel . When you step in to the lobby of the hotel , it brings you back to how San Francisco hotels should feel back in the 40s . Although , the modern amenities in the room and the lobby make the hotel really comfortable . Stay at the Maxwell if you want the small , boutique feel in a hotel .####[([0], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS'), ([32], [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([57], [56], 'POS'), ([0], [67, 68], 'POS'), ([63], [56], 'POS')]

Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming , so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there . The lobby is absolutely exquisite , and the staff were warm and welcoming . The rooms didn ' t quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side . However , the bathrooms were larger than most I ' ve seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean .

Tiny room with many ants The room wasn ' t available to check - in until late afternoon . Once in the tiny room we discovered it was full of ants .

Super convenient Arriving just before a holiday in Japan was difficult to find any reasonable hotel with vacant rooms , so we decided to try this ( based on reviews from TripAdvisor , of course ) . Upon arriving at the airport ( Narita ) , we asked to go to Shinagawa and were given a ticket for a train that went directly there , right across the street from the hotel . Shinagawa really is right outside Tokyo , but that ' s a 5 minute train ride , with trains leaving Shinagawa every 3 ~ 5 . About the hotel it is huge , with many options for food and entertainment , I suspect people go there for vacation and never leave the premisses . Depending on which tower you stay in ( Main Tower was great ) , the rooms are new , but a bit small , with everything needed in a hotel , including a small fridge ( bring your snacks and water ) . Very clean , nothing to say about that , except that some floors smelled like cigarretts . Internet is paid ( about US $ 10 . 00 ) and it is wired , so bring your wireless router ( Apple makes a great pocket - sized one ) . There ' s a convenience store downstairs , that over charges everything , but when needed it ' s there .####[([101], [104], 'POS'), ([101], [135, 136, 137, 138], 'POS'), ([142], [144], 'POS'), ([142], [148, 149], 'NEG'), ([161], [160], 'NEG'), ([142], [170, 171], 'POS'), ([101], [181, 182, 183, 184, 185], 'NEG'), ([187], [189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196], 'NEG'), ([223, 224], [228, 229, 230], 'NEG')]

We stayed here for 2 nights and found the room comfortable and a good size . The room was a little dated but clean . My only complaint would be that the air conditioning is very noisy - you can hear the corridor one all the time . Saying this it certainly didn ' t keep me awake at night .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([34], [35], 'POS'), ([34], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([34], [45, 46], 'NEG'), ([34], [48], 'POS'), ([57, 58], [60, 61], 'NEG')]
Fabulous top class hotel We stayed for 3 nights here , in between visiting Kuala Lumpur then Pengang ~ without a shadow of a doubt this was the best part of the trip . We could not fault the hotel , the location was great , the staff superb and the rooms absolutely wonderful , very spacious and the most wonderful bathrooms . I was suprised about other reviews commenting on the pool , we were delighted with the pool and the wonderful towels provided , especially as this is a City hotel . We will stay here again when we next visit this vibrant beautiful city .####[([3], [0, 1, 2], 'POS'), ([42], [44], 'POS'), ([47], [48], 'POS'), ([51], [52, 53], 'POS'), ([51], [55, 56], 'POS'), ([51], [59, 60, 61], 'POS'), ([72], [76], 'POS'), ([83], [82], 'POS'), ([3], [96, 97, 98], 'POS')]
Great location I stayed in this hotel in jan 2007 for three nights , you could not wish for a better location , everything is within reasonable walking distance and for those who don ' t like to walk there is a tram stop directly outside the hotel . my room was small but clean with tv and tea + coffee making facilities and a safe big enough for a laptop . The bathroom was fine with a good shower . I did not eat in the restaurant as their is plenty of choice in amsterdam , the bar is expensive but a pleasant enough place to meet up or finnish the night . The staff were friendly and helpfull , I would stay here again .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'POS'), ([1], [42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS'), ([50], [52], 'NEG'), ([50], [54], 'POS'), ([65], [66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'POS'), ([73], [75], 'POS'), ([98], [100], 'NEG'), ([98], [103, 104], 'POS'), ([115], [117], 'POS'), ([115], [119], 'POS'), ([6], [123, 124, 125], 'POS')]
One of the few good ones Great service , unbeatable location . . . where in Europe you have to struggle to fit into the 2x4 bathroom space , this hotel has a great bath , close to Leidesplein ( 1min walk ) Tram 2 / 5 stop right outside , also close to all museums . . . bars / clubs . . . Best to book on priceline , select 4 star and put a price of $ 80 - 90 / night , more than likely you will get this , its one of the very few 4 star hotels in AMS taht is on priceline .

Below expectations We have been staying at this hotel for 2 nights mid of september . Although the location is great as you are in the heart of SAF , we have been disappointed by the level of quality of this hotel . It presents itself as a cute boutique hotel which is how it looks on the website , however the reality is not . Room was tiny , deco was average , cleaning was it is minimum levels . It depends what you are looking for in yuor trip but don ' t expect to stay in a real boutique hotel , you will be disappointed as we were .####[([18], [20], 'POS'), ([8], [33], 'NEG'), ([66], [68], 'NEG'), ([66], [70, 71, 72], 'NEU'), ([66], [74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79], 'NEG')]
Nice hotel with a European feel Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous . The location was great and so was the continental breakfast . The only bad things were that our room had no AC so it was hot and there was a lot of road noise and we used earplugs .

Good location but now looking dated Stayed at the Blacket for 7 nights from the 28 . 12 . 06 , we were charged a huge supplement for New Year and were annoyed to find the hotel restaurant was closed , the only choice for breakfast was an over priced continental breakfastLeaking ceiling took 4 days to fixLocation is great , room was large but very drab .

Great Hotel This is a great hotel , on arrival we were upgraded without asking to a delux room with great views of a wonderful city .

great little hotel Just returned from a 3 night stay , excellent choice , everything spot on . location good hotel spotless breakfast great , rooms little small but never in em only to sleep . Dont eat on the ramblas to expensive , find the cava bar by the port side street , cava flowing bottle for 2 only 3 euros and a all you can eat buffet on the street ajoining ramblas by the gaudi bit further down . In general spent a fortune its not cheap barcelona but you have to spend when there cause theres loads to do see ya next year Deserves its rating We booked our stay based on the tripadvisor rating and were not disappointed . We knew what to expect in Venice and were happy to be near the train , the vaporetto , piazza di Roma and away from San Marco . The room was nice though not large , the bed and pillows very good and the bathroom excellent . The breakfast was varied and tasty .

Wow , what a great little hotel . My wife and I loved the hotel , the staff were very friendly and helpful , the room was quiet ( exactly what we asked for ) , the atmosphere was great and we both loved the old world charm of the histiric building . Great shopping nearby and an easy walk to most of downtown San Francisco . We would not hesitate to recommed the Beresford Arms Hotel in San Francisco to any traveller looking for great priced accomodation . This is the second time my wife stayed at the Beresford and it was as a result of her first stay ( 10 years ago ) that we decided to stay there this time , neither of us regretted that decision and we will certainly be staying there the next time we visit San Franciso .####[([6], [2, 3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([17], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([17], [22], 'POS'), ([25], [27], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [69, 70, 71, 72], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [85, 86], 'POS')]

Great Resort , Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites , pools and golf , but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation . The suites at PHTC are roomy , clean , quiet and offer great views . We stayed 3 days at this resort and would definitely stay again , but would avoid the restaurants . The staff at the Resort are super helpful ( and this includes the restaurant staff ) , but the 3 different resataurants we ate at ( on property ) were mediocre at best .

Pleasantly surprised ! I stayed here over a weekend and paid a ridicously low rate , so I wasn ' t expecting much . The concierge was very helpful and the beautiful hotel bar is a wonderful place to relax with a glass of wine and listen to piano , or later in the night , the jazz quartet . My room was very large , my only complaint is the plumbing is still very old ( it took a long time for the hot water ) .

Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site , and the hotel lived up to expectations ! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help . We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children , but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around , so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room ! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food !

The room was lovely , really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries , a well - stocked mini bar and a pillow menu , so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best ! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of , with big comfy leather sofas , a huge TV and free tea , coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday - Thursday between 6pm and 7pm ! The staff were also great , really friendly and helpful . The location is good , between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away , and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues .

Not 5 star quality went on a short break with my husband and we were very dissappointed with the service or lack of . Firstly their advertised swimming pool and leisure centre are not in operation , the safe in our room did not work and the staff were not familier with what services were on offer in their hotel , which for a 5 star was a bit bizzare . We made a complaint but as there were no managers and it was not the receptionists fault personally we didn ' t get much satisfaction .

average at best This hotel has a good location , but not a lot else , it took the staff three goes to get us to the right room , including giving us the key to an occupied room , and keys that did not work . We were then allegedly upgraded , from what I cannot imagine , the room was tiny , and not air conditioned . The continental breakfast was a complete farce , a few stale bread rolls in a converted bedroom , which had then to be carried back to the bedroom , where there was no where to eat but on the bed .

After reading some of the very negative reviews here I was slightly worried if hte positive impression we had had mabye changed . But no ; we enjoyed the time there as much as before . The room was extremely clean , enough space for 3 people , the location just always again is simply perfect for buying food , going for walks ( Jardin de plantes ! ) or simply wathcing people . So I still highly recommend this Hotel for people who don麓t want to spend too much money but want to have a nice , clean and friendly stay in a lovely area of Paris !####[([61], [63, 64], 'POS'), ([61], [66, 67], 'POS'), ([73], [78, 79], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [100, 101, 102], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [120], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [122], 'POS'), ([14, 15], [124, 125], 'POS')]

Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect . Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one .

Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October , our second stay there , and it was lovely . If possible , ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias . We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain , the cathedrals and the hillsides around town . The restaurant , Mark ' s , is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island .

Great Hotel We are not regular 5 Star hotel inhabitants , but we decided to splurge and spend a night at the Argonaut on a recent trip ( Sept 2003 ) thru CA . The Hotel was a dream , the staff was friendly and helpful , the location is convenient to everything , and the 5PM wine tasting ( Free ) was excellent ! ! We ended up staying 2 nights from our room overlooking the Golden Gate . . I would Highly recommend this Hotel to anyone planning a trip to the S .

Loved the Oceanarium I picked this hotel because I had heard about the 3 story high Oceanarium aquarium inside of it on my last trip to Hawaii . It was definitely impressive , though the lunch menu at the downstairs restaurant that shares space with it was pretty spare . Still , it was worth the trip to the restaurant just to take photos . My hotel room had what I ' d call a partial ocean view , you can see the ocean between several other hotels that block out most of your view .

Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny , barely lit , musty and just unbearable .

Gem in a Non - Touristy Area We booked based on online reviews alone and were not disappointed . I like to find places that are not full of your typical tourists and most people don ' t know about this place . We got great service , a great view , a terrific location and a few other things that are unusual for big city hotels ( e . g . , the pillow menu and the emphasis on physical / health activities ) . I was told that visiting professional sports teams often stay here and that there is a private gym in the building for them . I can see why - - nice accommodations and privacy out of the prying eyes ( mostly ) of tourists . I want to stay here again .####[([46], [45], 'POS'), ([66], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([66], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([54], [53], 'POS'), ([66], [116, 117], 'POS')]
I love this hotel ! This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in ! I want my house to be as nice as this ! It is in a great location and the hotel is spacious and comfortable .

ok , but not great Given the reviews , we were expecting more than the Lazy Parrot turned out to have to offer . The room was ok , but needed updating and we never did get hot water in the shower . The Smilin ' Joe ' s was closed for ' remodeling ' . They ' re in the process of building an additional building next door , so while the pool was open , it really wasn ' t usable .####[([25], [27], 'NEU'), ([25], [30, 31], 'NEU'), ([41], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'NEG'), ([73], [78, 79, 80, 81, 82], 'NEG')]
Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel . The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying . The bedroom was small , but intimate with everything a girl would want . . . . voluminous pillows , the finest sheets , and a comforter that you wanted to wrap yourself in along side your bed mate .

Loved the Marriott Marquis I was a bit unsure about this location due to the possibility of noise . We had a room on the 30th floor . It was very quiet and we have no complaints .

absolutely no complaints Having read some of the reviews , we were a bit weary about this hotel . It turned out to be an excellent base for our three night stop . What valuables we did have ( passports , cash etc ) was stored in the reception safe and always available .

Great facilities - but keep your eye out for reduced rates Star City has 24 / 7 convenience thanks to the adjoining casino , but the rooms themselves are a little tired . That said , they ' re still well equipped - the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in had everything we needed , except for the absolute lack of patio furniture . Beds were clean and comfy , and the lounge room was roomy . The hotel is starting to show its age though , and the standard prices are several times what they should be . If you want to stay somewhere nice and central ( and open around the clock ) , check out local hotel websites in advance and you should be able to score a room here at half the price or less .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([26], [30, 31], 'NEG'), ([26], [39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([45], [51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([45], [58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'NEG'), ([45], [64, 65, 66], 'POS'), ([45], [68], 'POS'), ([72], [75], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'NEG'), ([26], [89, 90, 91, 92, 93], 'POS')]

Not for me Didn ' t really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities , however we knew this before checking in . The room we had was very basic , had no safe , was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel , were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed .

Pure Quality , if you don ' t mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week . Had a great room overlooking the church ( 17th floor ) . I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal , service was good and the bar area was impressive . This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside , but you do pay for it - ( my room rate was of around $ 600 a night ) . Overall very happy with the hotel , though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $ 27 .####[([41], [42], 'POS'), ([41], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([23], [22], 'POS'), ([44], [46], 'POS'), ([49], [50, 51, 52], 'POS'), ([41], [57], 'POS'), ([41], [61, 62, 63], 'POS'), ([74], [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82], 'NEG'), ([41], [86, 87], 'POS'), ([99], [105, 106, 107, 108], 'POS'), ([99], [98], 'POS'), ([120], [111, 112, 113], 'NEG')]

Bargain and convenient location For years , I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only . The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room . The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front . if , like me , you juts need a place to sleep and shower , the beds could be better but the water has always been hot , and it is a bargain !

Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment , but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes , and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes , which improved the whole situation . The hotel is really quite plush , the rooms had everything we needed , and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free ! The staff were very helpful , and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go . The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others , but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day , and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water , wasn ' t to be turned down . It is definitely a hotel I would visit again , particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG'), ([1], [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 'NEU'), ([1], [63, 64, 65], 'POS'), ([68], [70, 71, 72], 'POS'), ([85], [77], 'POS'), ([92], [87, 88, 89], 'POS'), ([92], [94, 95], 'POS'), ([92], [98], 'POS'), ([112], [109], 'NEG'), ([1], [168, 169], 'POS')]

The concierge and all of the staff were always friendly and helpful . We tried to upgrade to a full ocean view and couldn ' t but the partial view was still wonderful . You can never miss at Embassy with the full made to order breakfast and daily managers reception . Highly reccomend and was excellent all around .####[([9], [0], 'POS'), ([30], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([35], [40], 'POS'), ([10], [57, 58, 59, 60, 61], 'POS'), ([9], [81, 82], 'POS'), ([9], [85, 86, 87], 'POS')]
Affordable but dumpy I ' m kind of shocked to read all the great reviews of this hotel . It was an inexpensive hotel for the area yes , but grungy and worn . The bed was very uncomfortable . Maybe people are happy not to see bugs or whatnot , but nothing really great to relay about this place .####[([17], [0], 'POS'), ([17], [2], 'NEG'), ([17], [22], 'POS'), ([17], [30, 31, 32], 'NEG'), ([17], [52, 53, 54], 'NEG')]
Good for Marathoners Stayed here for the Marathon weekend , like they said it ' s not a great neighbourhood but you can ' t beat the price , parking is free , and the complimentary breakfast is what you need . The free shuttle bus worked well most of the time , we used it to get to the subway . They even made sure it was good to go for us marathon morning . I get the feeling they don ' t overpay the staff . . . . . . . . . . .####[([29], [31], 'POS'), ([36], [35], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [43], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([86], [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'POS')]
Great Value and Big Rooms We chose the Affinia 50 for a visit with our 2 kids ( ages 9 and 15 ) and were very pleased with the room , location and service .

Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki isn ' t great The location is good , right in Waikiki , close by the Honolulu Zoo , the price is one of the lowest online , but you really don ' t know what it really like till you stay here . They were in the process of changing the card key access , so we had to get new cards . There ' s two small swimming pools with astro turf , the room view was of the next building , the food in the hotel restaurant as the hotel itself was uninspiring . Threre ' s nothing really bad , just all second rate , and simply a disappointing experience to stay here .

I have been staying here for years . My brother and I go to New Orleans two or three time per year . We discovered the Prince Conti Hotel eight years ago , and we have been staying there ever since .

My room was Robbed at Riu Palace Punta Cana On June 7 , 2006 two personal items were stolen from my hotel room between 11 : 45 AM and 6 : 30 PM , a cell phone and a digital camara .

Stylish , friendly I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it . The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera , ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district . Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet , everything was superband included in the price . Drinks at the bar were expensive though . If I should be so lucky as to return to SF , I would want to stay again .####[([11], [0], 'POS'), ([11], [12, 13], 'POS'), ([26], [28], 'NEG'), ([26], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([11], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([50], [53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([50], [59], 'POS'), ([50], [60, 61, 62, 63], 'POS'), ([68], [70, 71], 'NEG'), ([11], [87, 88, 89, 90], 'POS')]
A Very Good Hotel at a Very Good Price This was a very good surprise in Madrid : The rate was extremely good ( 90 euros / night , booked about 2 months in advance ) ; included internet , minibar complimentary ; was Exceptionally Clean ; Recently renovated ; Quiet ; Well located ( short cab ride or walk to Prado in one direction ; Mayor Square in the other ) ; very friendly . I was extremely happy with this hotel and would recommend it if you ' re looking for a smaller hotel that is quiet and well located . Note , it did not have exercise facilities and the on site restaurant was pricey ; however , eating options were readily available at a number of restaurants within 1 to 3 minute walk .####[([3], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([3], [6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([3], [12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([3], [19, 20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([3], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([3], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([3], [50], 'POS'), ([3], [52, 53], 'POS'), ([3], [78, 79], 'POS'), ([3], [85], 'POS'), ([115], [117], 'NEG')]

An enjoyable hotel I stayed here recently while attending activites at UCLA . The hotel was well - managed and charming with a clean , soft - modern feel . Regarding location : it would be difficult to do much better as everything is quite close ( including the Getty ) . This hotel , of course , would not be a good pick for someone seeking a high - energy or party atmosphere .

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days ( before going back to work reality ) . We were in the first group to leave the ship , so we arrived at the hotel at 9 : 30am ! The staff couldn ' t have been friendlier . They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits , and we sunned at the beach had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2 : 30pm . We especially enjoyed the following : our very large and comfortable tower room , uncrowded beach , health club facilities , and good restaurants within walking distance .

Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel , three great pools to choose from . My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials , we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade , 75 $ resort credit , complimentary bottle of wine . I would recommend a little restaurant right down the street called Hacienda , we got breakfast there almost every morning for like 7 bucks a person it was really good food with an excellent view !####[([4], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([4], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([8], [7], 'POS'), ([4], [31, 32, 33, 34], 'POS'), ([4], [41, 42, 43, 44], 'POS')]

harming ! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed . We had room # 11 , which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn , but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast . We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by . The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful .

Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views .

Restaurant Recs The Ritz is a terrific hotel but their restaurant recommendations need updating .
