Great We went to the Ocean Bavaro hotel back in july this year . The staff were great and they worked really hard and long hours and always smiled . The food was nice but nothing over the top . Our room was amazing .

bugs and dirty bed bugs - black bugs - - in the bed under the sheets and the housekeepers were not surprised and they did nothing to help the situation . silverfish in the bathrooms . dirt and grime on all kitchen counters and tables . dirty floorsFor $ 111 . 00 plus tax , it seems good for 2BR and 2 Baths , kitchen and terrace .

Beautiful views Stayed here for 2 days on recent visit to Sydney . The location is excellent , definitely the best part of Sydney for tourists .

Great for our short break Nice place at a really decent price for proper Hong Kong hotel ( we booked through a thai website , great deal ) . It is not in centre of town but is 2 seconds from a tube line or you can do what we did every day for fun and get the trams that run all the way into the city . Pool on top is small but lovely for relaxing after HOT days sightseeing .

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights . Despite the other reviews which might scare you off , we found the staff friendly and very responsive , room was clean and in good shape , and only a few very minor issues . Whenever we called , someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less ( e . g . extra blankets and pillows ) . This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt .

Great hotel at the right price We spent 4 days at The Benjamin in July ; this was our fourth or fifth stay there over the past few years . An excellent hotel with a very attentive and professional staff . Great location in Midtown on the East Side , close to restaurants , shopping and an easy walk , cab or subway ride to museums . Highly recommended especially if you can find a good deal online either through the hotel itself or an online travel agency .

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton - family properties , and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay , it was hardly worth the price paid . Good points : very friendly staff , and terrific restaurantBad points : the room was dated - old rundown furniture , warped bathtub , stained bedding . I was only offered a double - queen suite in the main building , which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements . Overall , I ' ve had much better accomodations at Embassy Suites and Doubletrees in the hilton family . Next time , I would stay elsewhere in the area , and just drive over to dine at the Different Pointe of View restaurant .####[([13], [33, 34, 35, 36], 'NEG'), ([44], [42, 43], 'POS'), ([48], [47], 'POS'), ([52], [54], 'NEG'), ([58], [56, 57], 'NEG'), ([61], [60], 'NEG'), ([52], [63, 64], 'NEG'), ([44], [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74], 'NEG'), ([13], [126, 127], 'NEG')]

Wonderful staff but a little tired looking We have just returned from a 2 night stopover at the Regent en route from Australia . The staff and service at the Regent cannot be faulted , but we were disappointed to hear upon our arrival that the pool was closed for renovations . Not the best news for our daughters , who were eager to swim after the flight ! The hotel has arranged for guests to use the pool at the hotel next door , but whilst better than nothing , this was not terribly convenient . The hotel offers a quiet refuge just off busy Orchard Rd , but is showing its age and looks like it needs a rehaul .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [31, 32, 33], 'POS'), ([46], [48, 49, 50], 'NEG'), ([18], [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83], 'POS'), ([46], [93, 94, 95], 'NEG'), ([18], [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107], 'POS'), ([18], [111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120], 'NEG')]
Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again . If your looking for a clean room , near Bourbon Street , friendly staff , at a good price - this is the place .

kimberley A - OK We stayed at the Kimberley Hotel at the last week of April . The room was clean , the bed linens crisp and the bathroom spotless . For the price we paid , this was a great deal ! It ' s location was near to 7 - 11 , and shopping galore along Nathan Rd , Cameron and Granville St . . Just near the hotel is a money exchange dealer who gave us a good deal for our U .

Ok location , great hotel Spent one night at the hotel with my wife . The room is neither luxurious nor large , and the bathroom is also small , but the hotel and room were new , very clean and larger than some we had seen on the internet , judging by the photos . It even had a nice view of one small charming canal . The staff was also very polite and helpful . This hotel is not so well located as the Centraal Station Ibis , but is close to the metro and you get very fast to the heart of the city .

worth the price ! We stayed at the Ritz Millenia for 5 days in Sep 06 . Their staff were super friendly - and made all the arrangements we asked for .

Nice , Basic Hotel with Great Location This is a basic little place , nothing too flashy .

vercharged at check out ! The hotel room was fine , rather small but ok . What I was very unhappy about was that I booked my stay online and got the early booking rate .

BE Careful Hotel was OK , had problem with room , lack of water ( Hot Cold ) also had small ant infestation . Hotel opened up resources to outsiders on weekends , so you spent your time waiting to be served or dodging children in pools .

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used ( think they may have gone out of business now as can ' t find them any more ) to the Hotel Piet Hein . When we arrived thought nice hotel , only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel ' s annex which was a few doors down the same street . Absolute nightmare of a room , up three flights of very steep stairs , room very dirty , ripped curtains , mould in bathroom , stained carpets , etc . Didn ' t get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in . In short , not somewhere I would reccomend . That said , things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago , but beware when booking , make sure its the main hotel which is really nice .####[([87], [83, 84], 'NEG'), ([2], [93, 94, 95], 'NEG'), ([87], [98, 99], 'NEG'), ([87], [101, 102], 'NEG'), ([106], [104], 'NEG'), ([87], [108, 109], 'NEG'), ([87], [113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122], 'NEG'), ([2], [146, 147, 148, 149, 150], 'NEG')]

Personally . . . They have an excellent personal service , I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included , because I had to pay 12 euros per head . Apart from that , I loved the room . Although it was on the 3rd floor it was a quiet room and the location is perfect for shoppers !

Elegant bargain Lovely hotel , clean and new due to recent remodelling , which seems to be completed . ( As of 12 / 07 there is some construction on the east side of the hotel , but it does not affect hotel access . ) Breathtaking views of Hudson River and WTC site . Close to Tribeca , subway , and steps from train station at WTC . You can get great deals directly from their website , probably to build up business again after remodel . Highly recommended .####[([3], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([3], [2], 'POS'), ([3], [5], 'POS'), ([3], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([3], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([3], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'POS'), ([3], [72, 73], 'POS'), ([3], [88, 89], 'POS')]

Just perfect We stayed at the Ilima for 8 nights in January , 2006 . We arrived a full 39 hours late , due to snow in Tokyo , but the hotel did not make us pay for the first night that we weren ' t there . They even let us stay for an extra night , at the same very low rate . The hotel was great ; lots of space , clean , very central to everything in Waikiki , but very quiet too .

Traumatic experience I attended the Boston gift Show and stayed at the Hilton from March 31 to april 5 , 2005 . It was one of my worst night mares when someone actually unlocked my door at 10 : 20 p . m . on the night of Saturday 2nd . It took 48 hours to get a response and to date no one has called me to report what actually happened that night . I checkjed out on April 5 and then again nothing was said to me . I am not amused after the trauma I went through that night .

Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora - Spend your money elsewhere My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Laguna Nusa Dora this week ( departed 16 / 8 / 06 ) . The first thing we noticed was that none of the guests were smiling . We realised that the breakfast charges of 330 , 000 R for breakfast for two was way over the top , and started visiting outside the resort . Everything works , it鈥檚 all nice , but it feels like nobody鈥檚 there , and its not fun .####[([49], [61, 62, 63, 64], 'NEG'), ([0, 1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'NEG')]
Great location and friendly hotel I chose this hotel mainly due to location as I was taking my Mum who can ' t walk so far - but it was a great choice alround . We were upgraded to one of the new apartments which was great and the staff were all friendly and helpful . Breakfast is very good and the light snacks in the roof bar are excellent - plus the open terrace is a great location to sit and have a glass of wine and admire the view . Very good location and close to some very good restaurants .

Great Customer Service . . . Stayed for two nights and was placed into the wrong room type on the first night due to ' overbooking ' . This was not a bother as I was by myself for the first night .

Great location , not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size . I reserved directly with the hostel by email ( in Spanish ) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going , specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square . However , we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal , overlooking the road that was being dug up . Although they said the next day we could move rooms , they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning , which was rather annoying . Overall , it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([6], [3, 4, 5], 'NEG'), ([8], [10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([15], [17], 'POS'), ([15], [20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEU'), ([6], [69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79], 'NEG'), ([6], [123], 'NEG'), ([8], [129, 130], 'POS'), ([1], [135, 136, 137], 'POS')]

Fantastic location for exploring Amsterdam It is worth saying that this is not a hotel you ' d go to if you want a really upscale , romantic place to stay . BUT the hotel is in an excellent location from which to explore the city of Amsterdam . It ' s a two minute walk to the Dam Square , 10 minute walk to the Central Station and within easy walking distance of everything in central Amsterdam . The hotel is clean and quiet an comfortable , but I would say the key selling point is the fact that it is so well located .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([14], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'POS'), ([1], [38], 'POS'), ([1], [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'POS'), ([1], [70, 71, 72], 'POS'), ([14], [82], 'POS'), ([14], [84, 85, 86], 'POS'), ([1], [103, 104], 'POS')]
City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home .

l location I stayed a couple of days in NYC on my way home from the West Coast . I picked the Sofitel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and the Internet rates they were offering . I really enjoyed the location , the hotel is great ( nice lobby , stylish rooms , good concierge service , etc ) .

Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive , superb location very close to station , air - conditioned rooms , lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price ! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax , a 10 % tax that everyone has to pay . Although it ' s possible for non - Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $ 300 , that doesn ' t apply to services .

Horrendous customer service Overall , stay was just okay , but was tainted by management ' s unwillingness to honor their own quoted / written and confirmed total cost . At check - out , ended up paying additional 10 % because of hotel ' s error in confirmation , even after being told at check - in that they would honor confirmed price . For this alone , would never recommend or stay there again , and we do intend to visit San Juan again . Conceptually , hotel was great architectural idea .

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit San Francisco .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [21], 'POS'), ([31], [38], 'POS'), ([31], [40], 'POS'), ([31], [44, 45, 46], 'POS'), ([49], [51], 'POS'), ([49], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([49], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([1], [61], 'POS')]
ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance / house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day . The hotel seemed very fake and tried to be hip . The rooms were very comfortable with nice pillows and comfy bed though . Overall , there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there .####[([9], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([9], [3], 'NEG'), ([9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'NEG'), ([9], [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], 'NEG'), ([9], [42, 43], 'NEG'), ([51], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([51], [56, 57], 'POS'), ([51], [59, 60], 'POS')]
Simply Fine , Incredible Value Almost everything was just right . Small hotel , front desk and bell staff unobtrusive and HELPFUL , elevators work well , bed very comfortable room clean and well supplied with basics like 4 glasses changed daily , microwave oven and small ' fridge handy , and supremely knowledgable concierge . Overall , incredible value for NYC . Location - theater district and restaurant row - not bad , although going south on 8th is very down - scale ( but feels safe - - lots of police blending in everywhere - - never got an aggressive vibe from police or civilians ) . . Firestation around the corner never bothered us with noise , even though room faced the street ( on 15th floor may have helped - - that height certainly helped make the room bright and airy feeling . )####[([12], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([12], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([12], [8, 9], 'POS'), ([12], [11], 'NEG'), ([14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [19], 'POS'), ([14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [21], 'POS'), ([23], [25], 'POS'), ([30], [27, 28, 29], 'POS'), ([30], [31], 'POS'), ([30], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [38, 39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [49], 'POS'), ([48], [49], 'POS'), ([54], [52, 53], 'POS'), ([12], [58, 59], 'POS'), ([63], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], 'POS'), ([63], [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83], 'NEG'), ([63], [86, 87], 'POS'), ([12], [114, 115, 116, 117, 118], 'POS'), ([30], [142, 143, 144, 145], 'POS')]
Superb , comfortable stay The hotel was to an excellent standard and very friendly staff . Its an excellent base for sightseeing in London , with The Tower of London only 5 minutes walk away and the Tower Hill tube station on the circle line closer still . We didn ' t have breakfast in the restaurant but we had drinks in the very swish bar .

Bad experience This hotel is terrible . My friend booked this hotel for me for the night of March 13 , 2007 . However , when I reached the hotel that night around 11 : 40pm due to delayed flight , I was told my room reservation was cancelled . They did not arrange me to another room or hotel . This is a terrible experience happened to me . I will never live in this hotel again .####[([3], [0, 1], 'NEG'), ([3], [5], 'NEG'), ([3], [46, 47, 48], 'NEG'), ([3], [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77], 'NEG'), ([3], [51, 52, 53], 'NEG')]
Great hotel , good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence , approx 5 mins walk and about 10 - 15 mins to main city centre . We were pleasantly surprised by our room , the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious . Bathroom was clean . Breakfast was ok - we didn ' t bother getting up for it after the first morning ! There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by . An extra benefit of the hotel is that they have free internet access which is great for that lastminute research or online check inIf you ' re looking for a hotel that is great value for money , then definitely go for this one !####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS'), ([1], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'POS'), ([40], [36, 37], 'POS'), ([40], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([40], [46, 47, 48], 'POS'), ([40], [53], 'POS'), ([55], [57], 'POS'), ([59], [61], 'NEU'), ([1], [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'POS'), ([1], [88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93], 'POS'), ([106], [105], 'POS')]
PB We had a Fabulous time ! ! We brought our 2 small children with us and the hotel staff was very accomadating . The rooms were gorgeous with all the amenities . But the best part was the Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , hot choclate , and cold milk every night . This was complimentary and WONDERFUL .

Great location , nice rooms Located a couple blocks from Union Sq and right next to great shopping the Parc 55 was perfect for us .

Awesome hotel This is one of the best hotels I have ever liven in . We went there for our Puerto Rico leg of the honeymoon and the service the staff and the rooms were excellent .

Great Location Have now stayed here twice . The hotel represents good value for NYC and has an excellent health centre and pool . Other public areas are also impressive .

Don ' t arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor . I had a reservation for a room with a large bed . When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds . They did find a room with one large bed , in the smoking rooms , but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby . For 140 Euro , I expected a lot more . The next time I am in Madrid , I will find another hotel to stay in .####[([46], [70, 71], 'NEG'), ([46], [75, 76, 77, 78, 79], 'NEG'), ([103], [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89], 'NEG'), ([103], [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106], 'NEG')]
Bargain , excellent accomodations Our family of four stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza in Florence during March 2006 . We were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and the stylish modern furnishings ( bathroom as well ) . Staff was pleasant and very knowledgable about surrounding area and history . Excellent location within walking distance of the train station and hotel parking ( reasonable daily rate OF $ 13 . 00 US ) .

mfortable base for touring New York We stayed at the Eastgate Tower hotel during the October downpours in New York . We found the hotel very comfortable , with a huge suite including a living area , large bed , decent bathroom and usable kitchen . Compared to similar priced hotels in New York , it earns its above average rating . The location is good for the mid - town attractions , and also has good bus and subway links to SoHo , Greenwich Village , etc . Despite the torrential rain , we enjoyed our stay and still managed to have a fantastic time ! !####[([10, 11], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([24], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([31], [30], 'POS'), ([31], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([31], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([31], [40, 41], 'POS'), ([31], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [58, 59, 60], 'POS'), ([63], [65], 'POS')]

Great value , friendly staff This was the first stop of our honeymoon , and we very much enjoyed our stay at Amstelzicht . The staff were very welcoming and friendly , and we found the room to be satisfactory and clean . This is by no means a luxury hotel , but if you are looking for clean accomodations that present good value in Amsterdam , I highly recommend this hotel . The stairs are difficult to negotiate , so I would not recommend the hotel to those with physical disabilities . Otherwise though , we had a fabulous time , and there is a great restaurant just around the corner from the hotel .####[([22], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([4], [27, 28, 29, 30], 'POS'), ([36], [39], 'POS'), ([36], [41], 'POS'), ([22], [58, 59], 'POS'), ([22], [62, 63], 'POS'), ([22], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([22], [74, 75, 76, 77, 78], 'NEG'), ([22], [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91], 'NEG'), ([22], [106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111], 'POS')]
Excellent location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and although we did have some minor troubles ( check in delayed by half an hour , water pressure ) the staff of the hotel and the manager in particular demonstrated great understanding and excellent customer service . Interiors are very well designed , minimal being the key word . I ' d go back there as the location is perfect , we walked everywhere and didn ' t need to take the tube at all ! One highlight : the breakfast ! Eating out in Barcelona can be pretty pricey so the huge buffet with savory and sweet choices , cooked brekfast with tortillas , eggs , bacon , etc is definitely worth it !####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([31], [44], 'POS'), ([31], [41, 42], 'POS'), ([45, 46], [44], 'POS'), ([1], [70], 'POS'), ([91], [122, 123], 'POS'), ([91], [103, 104], 'POS')]
Spacious room A nice , clean hotel located in the downtown area . My room was very spacious with a fridge and microwave . Rate was much lower than other downtown hotels plus the parking is free .

ok if you like one place our family ( son 12 ) stayed at the dominicana for 2 weeks from 27th july , just to say ive been to DR now and won ' t return , the hotel facilities are execellent the grounds well maintained , the rooms fine , with clean bedding towels etc whenever needed . The food is ok but repetitive especially if you are staying for 14 days like we were . Entertainement was poor , nothing really jumped out to us and as an English family our son was bored to death as her had nothing to do , and most of the other guests were none english a lot of spanish , french usa . the beach and pool areas are fantastic no complaints there , like a lot of other people we had upset stomachs and my son was ill in bed on arriving home for 2 days Dont know were the problem lies as we were always careful with what we ate and drank . would be fine for a week but 2 weeks confined in one place is not for m####[([39], [41], 'POS'), ([43], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([48], [49], 'POS'), ([54], [52], 'POS'), ([60], [62], 'POS'), ([60], [64], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [77, 78, 79], 'NEG'), ([125], [128], 'POS')]

Reccomended .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([6], [5], 'POS'), ([19], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([4], [31, 32, 33], 'POS'), ([51, 52], [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'POS'), ([6], [64], 'POS')]
Great Service The Nine - Zero Hotel is in a great location , has nice rooms but most importantly has a great front of house team . Expert advice on where to eat in Boston which was spot on in terms of our requests and were happy to make bookings for us and get us into busy places during Boston ' s restaurant week .

great location This hotel is in a fantastic location , close to the shops , bus station and duomo . The staff are friendly .

As expected Efficient and friendly check in , simple swipe of the credit card as expected . The room was lovely , recently refurbished , very comfy beds . Bathroom was large clean , although it was a bit dark even with all the lights on so a bit hard to put make up on ! I didn ' t get to try the breakfast so can ' t comment there .

Over rated For the price you pay , make sure you get one of the better rooms . When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade ( basically all the cars going up can see you ) . I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later , I got the one I wanted , with a bit of a view for the same price . There ' s nothing extraordinary about this hotel , the gym is quaint , the rooms are small , the bathroom is actually really big , it was about 1 / 2 the size of the bedroom . . . the restaurant is pretty cool .####[([90], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'NEU'), ([90], [86, 87], 'NEU'), ([93], [95], 'NEG'), ([16], [100], 'NEG'), ([103], [105, 106, 107], 'POS'), ([124], [126, 127], 'POS')]
decent budget hotel This hotel was not in the heart of Amsterdam , but it wasn ' t too far from it . It was an easy walk to some of the busiest squares for going out at night . It was clean and comfortable , but nothing spectacular . There were a few burn marks , probably from smokers , but I guess that ' s to be expected in Amsterdam .

Decent hotel at Fisherman ' s Wharf This is the second time we ' ve stayed at the Wharf Inn .

Stay away from the mini - suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason Bay ; it ' s one of the noisiest hotel rooms I ' ve ever had the pleasure of being moved from . Great view , though .

Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause . We were not sure what to expect . We could not have been more impressed with the atmosphere and service . The room was tidy and comfortable .

Total incompetence The staff at this hotel all of the way up the manager are totally , totally incompetent , definitely stay away ! My initial reservation was totally botched by someone who sounded like a teenager answering the phones . Then when I called to cancel my reservation I discovered that the mistake had never been fixed . Even worse yet , despite cancelling , my credit card was still billed and after 6 calls and several e - mails to the hotel , including Leah the manager I was never responded to ! !

Excellent Location The hotel is very conveniently placed and is only a two minute walk from the Duomo . The majority of the reception staff spoke good English and were always polite and friendly . The rooms are small but clean , the views are far from spectacular and the furnishings are basic .

Great Deal Had a nice stay here . Staff was cordial . Modern decor in the East Tower was fine . Could see that mildew beginning to build up on the bath tiles will contribute to poor maintenance .

Recommended , but not for business travelers I stayed here on a brief business trip after reading a lot of positive reviews online . I ' m sure this hotel is fine for vacationers : the rooms are ok ( especially the kitchenettes ) , the location is pretty good , and the staff are helpful . However , I don ' t recommend it for those who need to come back in the evenings and work on their computer . The lighting in the rooms is even dimmer than the hotel norm , and the wireless internet mostly non - existent ( at least while I was staying ) .

Will go back any time We spent last weekend in Amsterdam . We wanted a good downtown location so opted for the Pulitzer . The room we were given was overlooking the inner garden , which was perfectly nice and quiet . Whilst we have seen bigger rooms in luxury hotels in the US and Far East , for European standards it was of a good size and very ell apointed and functional , something you don ' t see everywhere . Since the weather was so good lunch and dinner were served in the garden as well ( which we didnt join since we had other plans ) . Staff , especially porters and concierge , were extremely helpful in assisting with our plans , which were disrupted due to a rail strike on the first day of our stay . All in all , the location can ' t be beaten and with the uniqueness of the architecture and the helpful staff , Pulitzer gets a thumb up !####[([25], [30, 31, 32, 33], 'POS'), ([25], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([25], [40], 'POS'), ([25], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([25], [68, 69, 70], 'POS'), ([25], [72], 'POS'), ([113], [118, 119], 'POS'), ([115], [118, 119], 'POS'), ([147], [148, 149, 150, 151, 152], 'POS'), ([22], [156, 157, 158, 159], 'POS'), ([163], [162], 'POS'), ([22], [168, 169], 'POS')]

This used to be an exclusive New Orleans boutique hotelbut is now geared to lower end small company business conferences , cheap family getaway lets get drunk on Bourbon St crowd , and weddings anyday of the week which means : bottom line the facilities are not available 24 / 7 they are often closed such as the pool and courtyard . What was once a $ 400 night hotel for the business , elite traveler is now a $ 49 - 79night cheap 4 star ; check any Experien or Yahoo or Priceline , this is the cheapest of all the original Dupuy owners would be very disappointed . Very crowded , very low class . We had business guests with written reservations well in advance , two were bumped out of the hotel ; we were treated rudely , pulled our corporate account .####[([99], [101, 102, 103, 104, 105], 'NEG'), ([113], [108, 109], 'NEG'), ([115], [108, 109], 'NEG'), ([13], [132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138], 'POS'), ([13], [162, 163], 'NEG'), ([13], [165, 166], 'NEG'), ([13], [168, 169, 170], 'NEG'), ([13], [183, 184, 185, 186], 'NEG'), ([13], [193, 194], 'NEG')]

Recommended by a fussy pair ! My friend and I stayed in Room 273 and found it to be clean and comfortable . Sheets and towels changed daily , room was sufficient size with tea making facilities replenished each day , breakfast was simple but very edible and the staff , although we didn ' t require much , were helpful !

Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features , some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat . However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff . Minus points were the size of the bedroom ( small ) ; a sliding door on the bathroom that didn ' t have any pretence at privacy ; high bar prices ( $ 14 for a glass of wine ) and exorbitant parking charges ( $ 37 per day ) when there were public facilities on the same block ( for $ 24 a day . ) Overall , good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back . Darrin , the bar steward would make me want to go back though , just for the entertainment value .

Quiet and comfortable We chose to stay at the Bassano because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed . Our room was a really good size and very comfortable . Being situated on a small street near the Champs Elysee , it was lovely and quiet - perfect for some lazy mornings - especially as breakfast is served until a very civilised 10 : 30am . Breakfast was included in our rate and was very comprehensive with a great cold buffet selection as well as hot eggs , bacon , toast etc . We found everyone very friendly and helpful both by email before our trip and in person during our stay - we will definitely stay again .####[([9], [0], 'POS'), ([9], [2], 'POS'), ([9], [19, 20], 'POS'), ([23], [26, 27, 28], 'POS'), ([23], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([9], [46], 'POS'), ([9], [48], 'POS'), ([9], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54], 'POS'), ([9], [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67], 'POS'), ([69], [77, 78], 'POS'), ([83], [81, 82], 'POS'), ([9], [118, 119, 120], 'POS')]

Great location , excellent value We stayed 3 nights in the Royal Magda for during half term and booked a double and a large double with sofa bed for our 3 children ( 415 and 416 ) .

decent hotel As others have said , this place is nothing special , but for the price and location , it ' s actually very special . The actual room is a perfectly adequate budget motel room , except that our room had a view of coit tower , transamerica building , and the rest of downtown sf . From what I could see , other more expensive hotels near the area probably can ' t claim to have the view that we did . And that also means that you can walk to all kinds of great places and take the bus to others . Now if the kind people at the Columbus could only bring some sunshine and warmth to the city , then you would really have something .####[([1], [10, 11], 'NEU'), ([18], [23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([1], [23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([29], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([29], [34, 35], 'POS'), ([29], [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([18], [92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98], 'POS'), ([1], [0], 'POS')]
Fantastic trip We stayed for four nights at the Harbour Plaza North Point , in June 2007 . We booked a one bedroom suite and overall our experience was fantastic . The one bedroom suite is fabulous and great for the money . Its only a couple of minutes ' walk from MTR Quarry Bay station , there is a local supermarket directly opposite which is great . The staff were always helpful , plus on the day we were leaving they let us have our room for half a day extra at no charge .

Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it . Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it ' s a good standard hotel it ' s no longer that great . Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that . Now seems full of coch parties , meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners .

ideal location excellent location , not knowing the city , we found the hotel to be ideally located to the tourist area , pier 39 , the deals , alcatraz . The hotel was very plush inside , staff efficient , polite and nver without a smile . Our room was fantatic , modern clean and decorated to a very high standard . The one down side for myself was that we used it as a base and didn ' t get to appreciate the facilities .

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel , or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service , a very modern and up to date decor , large and comfortable rooms , all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops . The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11 . 00am just in case we ' d had a late night , a sun terrace on the roof with a ( small ) pool and gymnasium , although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife . Its great value for money and if you are looking for a safe bet , with good service and a convenient location look no further####[([5, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [8, 9, 10], 'NEG'), ([29], [28], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'POS'), ([43], [40], 'POS'), ([43], [42], 'POS'), ([21], [48], 'POS'), ([21], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'POS'), ([78], [80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'POS'), ([107], [105], 'NEG'), ([5, 6], [128, 129, 130, 131], 'POS'), ([29], [26], 'POS'), ([109], [105], 'NEG'), ([29], [143], 'POS'), ([21], [147], 'POS')]

Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington . The hotel is conveniently located ( about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro ) , the staff is friendly and accomodating , and the suites are comfortable and well laid out . The 32 ' ' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus . Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items ( eggs , omelets , etc ) and an evening cocktail reception , both of which are fantastic . The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro ( about a 5 - 10 minute ride ) .####[([23], [0], 'POS'), ([23], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([23], [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'POS'), ([40], [42], 'POS'), ([40], [44], 'POS'), ([48], [50], 'POS'), ([48], [52, 53, 54], 'POS'), ([57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], [70, 71], 'POS'), ([82, 83], [81], 'POS'), ([98, 99, 100], [106], 'POS'), ([23], [124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129], 'POS')]
Welcoming and friendly staff , elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel . The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel , from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants . The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous , with antique brick walls and elaborate , lush curtains . My favorite part of the hotel ( besides the amazing staff ) , was the location . It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions ( the steamboat tours , downtown New Orleans , The French Quarter , etc ) .

great location but thats about it . My husband and I have jusy returned from a four night stay in the Byrant hotel , we chose it after reading the rave reviews on trip advisor . The location is fantastic and the rooms are well laid out very well serviced etc . I would not reccomend this hotel because of the snooty attitute of quite a few of the staff which made it very uncomfortable , it was not a hotel to relax in just one to be seen in if you were of a certain age and dressed in a certain manner .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [39], 'POS'), ([42], [44, 45, 46], 'POS'), ([69], [47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([21], [54, 55], 'NEG'), ([69], [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], 'NEG'), ([21], [73, 74], 'NEG')]
Not bad but could be better , even at 3 stars The bathrooms are the most luxurious part of their accommodations - - really quite nice , but the room itself was fairly spartan . It did have a little sitting area , with two chairs and a table , but the beds were rock hard ( you want to ease down on them gently , lest you break a body part ) . The air conditioning was non - operative during our very warm stay in early - mid May ( the screenless window opened , however ) , the TV remote control did not work , although there was an attempt to repair it , and a spare blanket taken out of its plastic wrap in the closet smelled so musty that it needed to be replaced - - and was , with one that smelled somewhat less musty . On the positive side , the front desk and housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful , the public areas and the rooms were immaculate , the buffet breakfast included in the reasonable room price was excellent and the location of the hotel was convenient , if not particularly appealing . 聽聽####[([12], [15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([12], [23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([29], [32, 33], 'POS'), ([29], [39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([29], [52, 53, 54, 55], 'NEG'), ([75, 76], [78, 79, 80], 'NEG'), ([101], [102, 103, 104, 105, 106], 'NEG'), ([120], [130, 131, 132], 'NEG'), ([162], [164, 165], 'POS'), ([162], [167], 'POS'), ([29], [176], 'POS'), ([179, 180], [188], 'POS'), ([29], [184], 'POS'), ([191], [196], 'POS')]

#4 Hotel in Los Angeles ? ? ? Upon reading the glowing reviews for the Magic Castle Hotel I decided to book 2 nights . Upon check in the clerk informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite and that it was one of the newly refurnished rooms . Well if room 204 is a newly refurnished room I would have hated to see what the others looked like . The carpeting was stained , there were holes and cracks all over the bathroom wall and there was a large black mark in the tub . Granted the location is good , however if I knew that the rooms looked like this I would have gone to the Roosevelt .####[([29], [36, 37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([49], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([85], [79, 80, 81, 82, 83], 'NEG'), ([73], [75], 'NEG'), ([96], [91, 92, 93], 'NEG'), ([100], [102], 'POS')]

really disappointed I can not believe this hotel has such rating stay away from it , I think it deserve one star the most . The service is really bad and not to mention things disappear from your room and their respond is we are investigating it , they charge you for compelementry coffee , and it takes them five hours to get you a taxi to the air port .

mfortable Room , Chic space I stayed here recently on a work trip . The hotel was pretty cool as it had a variety of art pieces throughout the location and in each of the rooms .

A Perfect base We have just returned from our first NY visit and stayed at the Casablanca for four nights , largely on the basis of good reviews . We were not disappointed .

Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris , I was concerned to choose well . After reading several reviews on the internet , I selected the Hotel D ' Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice . The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was ' at the heart ' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme , Louvre , Pompidou Centre , Pantheon etc . The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright , clean , and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate . All in all , the Hotel D ' Albe surpassed all our expectations , and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit .

My favourite place to stay in Amsterdam Stayed here several times now and always been delighted with the service - great staff ! Good breakfast , comfortable rooms - small but on a par with much more expensive places in the Dam .

Go for the Casitas ! The El conquistador Casitas were awesome . The one I stayed in was huge with a full kitchen and ocean view from the balcony .

I would like to personally thank Concierge Kary and Carolina in working patiently with us in trying to locate our lost luggage ( airlines fault ) .

Great hotel , but not so great location The hotel is very modern , with an air of trendiness , the furniture is new and very nice , the bathroom is large , well equiped and the entire place is clean and shiny . On the other hand , some things are a little kitchy , like the linoleum on the hallway and in the room ( first I thought it ' s parquet ) , the breakfast is really poor , the parking a little too expensive ( 15 euros a day ) and the glass door from the bathroom annoying . The hotel is near the train station , but the trains were far less bothering than the people in the next room . Unfortunately you can hear everything through the walls . It takes about 15 minutes to the center .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([7], [4, 5, 6], 'NEG'), ([1], [11, 12], 'POS'), ([1], [16, 17, 18], 'POS'), ([21], [23], 'POS'), ([21], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([29], [31], 'POS'), ([65], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([65], [37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([65], [42], 'POS'), ([65], [53, 54], 'NEG'), ([77], [79, 80], 'NEG'), ([83], [85, 86, 87], 'NEG'), ([29], [96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101], 'NEG'), ([7], [106, 107, 108, 109], 'POS'), ([65], [128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133], 'NEG'), ([7], [136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142], 'POS')]

Big rooms , near the night - life attractions Weber Hotel is a good surprise . Very well - located for those looking for fun - the best bars in town are alligned just on the side - rooms are big for European standards and well - decorated . Service is good - enough and the stairs ( there ' s no elevator ) can be scary if you have big suitcases . Very good deal , specially for young couples . It can be a little noisy at night due the bars around , but nothing that bothers too much .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [13, 14], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [16, 17, 18, 19], 'POS'), ([1], [40], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'POS'), ([1], [45, 46, 47], 'POS'), ([49], [51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([62], [61], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [66], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [73, 74, 75], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [86, 87], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [96, 97, 98, 99, 100], 'POS')]
Would Stay There Again and Again I have been to Amsterdam a half - dozen times in the last few years , and Seven Bridges is where I will stay the next time and the time after that . The location is nearly unbeatable . The view from canal - side rooms is unbeatable . The rooms are charming , spotless and spacious . The price was right .

A great base to explore SF Stayed here for 3 days while exploring SF for the first time - what a great place ! Very central to Union Square and transport links , I was very pleased with my find as we were so central ! Good bed in average sized room , very large bathroom , breakfast supplied in lobby in the morning is the average American continental danish and coffee . Can really recommend this place if you are keen to be central and want to spend your time looking at the sites rather than trecking back to a hotel on the other side of the city####[([101], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([101], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([101], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], 'POS'), ([51], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([51], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([55], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([57], [66, 67, 68, 69], 'NEU'), ([101], [74, 75], 'POS')]

agree with " do not stay here " This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn ' t give it two . A hint to future guests : if you have a problem , it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations . They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it . They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns .

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews . Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar , were helpful , friendly and entertaining . Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated . The view alone is worth the visit ! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I ' ve visited .

Wonderful Choice location wise This hotel had such a wonderful location , that made me forget the noise during the evenings from the next door bar , and the rudness of the people at the front desk . Once the airconditioning is running you dont hear the noise , and when you only need five minutes to get to any place , you forget the rudness of the front desk staff . The rooms were clean , the breakfast was ok , and remember this , if is clean and has a great location , the restis not important . Will definitely come back here .

Fabulous , and fabulously expensive Stayed for one night on our way home from Australia and were totally seduced by this hotel . Singapore can be a bit soulless but Raffles Hotel is a fantastic retreat from the city .

Disappointed Just returned from a 10 hotel vacation and the Hyatt features as the poorest in terms of quality but not the cheapest . Room was OK but wardrobe door was loose and faulty . Hair in sink and bath was off putting . Best measure of ( lack of ) customer service was the filthy window which we reported immediately on check in - hand marks and writing on internal window .

Poor experience Avoid booking this hotel if you ' re driving a car . The hotel is extremely difficult to find with an obscure address ; according to the GPS in our rented car , the address did not even exist . It was likewise nearly impossible to find our way from the hotel to the airport ( if one doesn ' t take a shuttle ) , and consequently we almost missed our plane . We arrived late to check - in at the hotel ( just before midnight ) , yet our room STILL was not ready for us .

BEST OF THE BEST BY FAR Being a frequent traveller for both business and pleasure , I have to say that Hotel De L ' Europe has been one of the very best hotels I have ever stayed at .

Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter , picking the location for it ' s convenience for the airport for a flight the next day . Rooms are small and functional , bathroom ' unit ' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed . Bedding was a little strange , with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers .

Disappointing and watch the final bill I ' ve stayed at quite a few of the Morgan group hotels and whilst most of them are starting to look a bit dated ( given the price ) I ' ve returned as generally the atmosphere makes up for it . I wouldn ' t return to The Clift ; the Redwood Bar is fun and the concierge / front door staff are all good but that ' s about it . The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen ( and I had a loft suite ) - and for the price other hotels offer more ( no flat screen TV , ineffective air con ) . What really irritated me was when I checked my credit card they had charged me an additional US $ 185 for late checkout without any notification ( I had used their express checkout service and left the room by 11 . 00am ) .

It ' ll be great when it ' s finished ! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel . We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed , the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom . Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room . The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there .

Great location for the hotel - right on the beach front , with superb facilities including a never crowded pool complete with a pool bar and a choice of 3 fully functional restaurants . Well worth the option to upgrade to the Gold package All Inclusive option getting the full array of a La Carte menu options , imported spirits , late check out and free laundry service !

The hotel is in a quiet location about 15 minutes walk to the Placa Catalunya or 2 minutes to the Rocaforte Metro stop ( and then 5 minutes on the L3 line to the Pl .

True - - but their shuttle closes down earlier than any of the other hotels ' and it ' s a 20 euro cab ride .

This hotel is in a suburban business district - - it may be very convenient and useful on workdays ; my very short stay there , on a Saturday , after a long train ride and just in advance of a long plane trip , was nothing but a series of frustrations .####[([47], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([22], [23, 24, 25], 'NEG'), ([47], [50, 51, 52], 'NEG'), ([95, 96], [56, 57, 58, 59], 'NEG'), ([63, 64], [67], 'NEG'), ([95, 96], [88, 89, 90, 91, 92], 'NEG'), ([47], [147, 148, 149], 'NEG')]

Ate at Saraceno in the North End and The Four Seasons Restaurant - both fabulous .####[([0], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG'), ([0], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([0], [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([30], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'NEG'), ([0], [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'POS')]

Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter . In spite of the rate , we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check - in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids . Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids welcome pack at check - in . Truly superior service all around from valet parking to baggage check to front desk . Loved the hotel and location and will definitely stay again .####[([97], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([5], [3], 'POS'), ([97], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([5], [31, 32, 33, 34], 'POS'), ([5], [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([5], [80, 81, 82], 'POS'), ([97], [95], 'POS'), ([97], [102, 103, 104], 'POS'), ([5], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([97], [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78], 'POS')]
IDEAL for large groups . Stayed here for a Stag weekend with 20 other lads in our 30 ' s and 40 ' s . Found it to be a good quality , well run , clean hotel . Staff were all very curteous and welcoming ( even when returning from nights out at 5 . 30AM ) and rooms were clean and adequate . Didn ' t sample the food - plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars within 50 yards . Steps to ( excellent ) Metro system are outside the front door and this takes you anywhere in the City including the Airport ( get a day card - about 5 Euros or a T - 10 ticket that allows 10 journeys ) . Would definately recommend this professionally run place - especially for large groups - only down side was the cost of the breakfast - 15 Euro ' s a day is a bit stiff .####[([37], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([37], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([37], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([37], [36], 'POS'), ([39], [41, 42, 43], 'POS'), ([39], [45], 'POS'), ([59], [61], 'POS'), ([59], [63], 'POS'), ([37], [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'POS'), ([37], [88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'POS'), ([37], [128, 129], 'POS'), ([37], [131, 132, 133], 'POS'), ([148], [150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159], 'NEG')]

Yawn , it ' s another Hilton It ' s a Hilton . If you ' ve stayed in one before , you know what you ' re going to get .

Absolutely terrible ! We stayed here in August 2006 and this is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at .

Like a spacious apartment Our room at the Lenox was enormous . It was a perfect oasis to return to each night , with a huge bathroom and a separate closet room .

Good Value and Great Location I was looking for a clean and pleasant hotel in a central location and this really fits the bill . The modernisation has ben done thoughtfully with old features retained but clean , spacious modern rooms . The staff were helpful and the hotel was great as a base to explore the city . I did not eat in the hotel - there were too many tempting local restaurants nearby - but the bar was stylish and welcoming .

There are better places in NOLA Good conference rooms for large group . But the hotel can not handle it when it comes to house keeping . The bar was really bad .

Location , Location , Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters , this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms ( new plasma TV ' s ) at an incredibly good price . Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring . Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones , etc . but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay .

Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic , the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms . It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin ( its very cheap , efficient and easy to navigate ) but the area was no problem - I guess it ' s worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are . I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price , venue and facilities ( breakfast , spa , small bar , minibar , bikes available and outside seating ) .

Great Area in Boston We had to take our son to Boston Children ' s Hospital and this hotel is extremely close by . The amenities of this hotel are great and accomodating especially after a long day in the hospital . The bar area was great , the food court attached had everything for somebodies taste and the hotel was close to the train , Fenway Park and tons of other neat attractions . At one point during our visit , the hotel had to shut down the water ( not their fault however an inconvenience ) and our A / C did not work the greatest .

Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels , so Laguna had to meet the expectations , and mostly it did . My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool .

Good value weekend break When we stayed , they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money . We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel . Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times . Good location in a quiet area and convenient for buses and trains . Just 200m from both KaDeWe store and the tourist office in the Europa Centre .####[([53], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([53], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS'), ([53], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35], 'POS'), ([46], [40], 'POS'), ([46], [42, 43], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [63, 64, 65, 66, 67], 'NEU'), ([70], [69], 'POS'), ([70], [73, 74], 'POS'), ([70], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80], 'POS'), ([70], [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91], 'POS')]
Good stay This hotel is located in one the better parts of Amsterdam and it shows . No busy streets , close to all important attractions Amsterdam has to offer and now weird people wandering around at night . The staff is well trained and polite ( they lent me a very nice umbrella when it rained - which I of course kept ) . Our room was a bit small but otherwise nice . I would recommend this hotel to anyone .####[([3], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([3], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([3], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([40], [42, 43], 'POS'), ([40], [45], 'POS'), ([40], [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([66], [69, 70], 'NEG'), ([66], [73], 'POS'), ([3], [77], 'POS')]
Excellent AB Viladomat Having just spent four nights at the hotel AB Viladomat I can highly recomend it as a clean good value and very pleasant place to spend a few days . The staff were all very friendly and helpful I would have great difficulty in faulting the hotel at all , it is a little way away from the city centre but the public transport is so simple to use that it is not a problem . The main tourist spots are within a twenty minute walk . I would certainly use the AB Viladomat if I were to travel to Barcelona again .####[([1, 2], [0], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [20], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([34], [36, 37, 38], 'POS'), ([34], [40], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [44, 45, 46, 47], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'NEU'), ([1, 2], [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88], 'POS')]
A nice , affordable hotel in the perfect location Grupotel Gravina may not be the poshest hotel in Barcelona , but it provides a wonderful home base for seeing the city at a good price . Just 2 blocks away from the top of La Rambla and a ten minute walk from the Block of Discord , you can ' t stay in a more central location for seeing Barcelona ' s top sights . Our room was a nice size and had a balcony that overlooked a quiet street . Our only minor complaint was that we could hear the noise in the hallway when our neighbors came in and out of their room , and when the housekeeper vacuumed relatively early ( 9 : 30ish ) in the morning . Otherwise , this hotel was definitely a great choice for those who are more concerned about saving a few Euros than staying in the most upscale hotel in the city .####[([9, 10], [1], 'POS'), ([8], [7], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [3], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'POS'), ([8], [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS'), ([76], [79, 80], 'POS'), ([76], [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89], 'POS'), ([76], [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104], 'NEG'), ([9, 10], [137, 138, 139, 140], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [148, 149, 150, 151], 'POS')]
loved this hotel loved this classy hotel . lovely lobby , beautiful rooms , pleasant staff . Didn ' t eat here but located short stroll from upmarket outdoor mall with nice restaurants / cafe . Valet parking good service but pricey . When returned to UK appeared to have been charged the wrong amount to our credit card - tried to sort out by email but are insisting we write to them if we want a copy of our account - not hugely convenient when you live on the other side of the world . hope to get this sorted out as appear to have been significantly overcharged and if we can ' t sort it would not stay here again .####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([2], [5], 'POS'), ([9], [8], 'POS'), ([12], [11], 'POS'), ([15], [14], 'POS'), ([36, 37], [38], 'POS'), ([36, 37], [41], 'NEG'), ([2], [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58], 'NEG')]

An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us . It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel , where peace and tranquillity was the order . The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent . Some may consider the rooms on the small side , but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair , you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer . I have recommended the hotel to both family and friends and will definately stay here again on our next visit .####[([24], [33], 'POS'), ([19], [38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 'POS'), ([24], [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([56], [59], 'POS'), ([56], [61], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [67], 'POS'), ([73], [76], 'NEG'), ([73], [82, 83, 84], 'POS'), ([73], [87, 88, 89], 'POS'), ([24], [123], 'POS'), ([24], [133, 134], 'POS')]

Location , Location , Location - - and a great hotel Just returned from staying three nights at the Chancellor Hotel and have to say that all the Trip Advisor reviews were right on the money . We enjoyed the above - par service , the clean and cozy room ( yes , a little tight but workable ) , the coffee and cookies in the lobby 24 / 7 , and cozy bar where we could enjoy a cocktail in a quiet atmosphere - - all at a very reasonable price . Best of all , the hotel is totally non smoking ! ! Location is perfect , right near Union Square and in front of a cable car stop , within walking distance of many fine resturaunts and shopping areas .

friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner , given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures , and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were , which we found to be most helpful . The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast ( buffet ) , it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers . A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found , also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby , making the hotel very central but not noisey . We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible . A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam .####[([131], [0], 'POS'), ([8], [2], 'POS'), ([131], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS'), ([131], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([8], [54], 'NEG'), ([8], [56], 'POS'), ([61, 62, 63], [60], 'POS'), ([8], [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86], 'POS'), ([8], [100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106], 'POS'), ([8], [111, 112], 'POS'), ([8], [114, 115], 'POS'), ([131], [140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146], 'POS'), ([131], [149, 150], 'POS')]

The Essence Music Fiasco This establishment played the staring role in the worst trip ever ! It would seem that the toilet being constantly flooded would be bad enough , but no , they went and topped themselves by being infested with termites .

Decent deal , decent hotel Great place to stay as it is clean , has a modern Asian feel in the decour , and a decent breakfast to start you on your way . The room was spacious and the bathroom was huge . Book a room away from the elevator or stairway access doors as these can be a tad noisy because all guests go through the same area and the hallways are hardwood flooring . This hotel is close to the subway but make sure you have clear directions to reach it as it took us close to 2 hours to find and the locals didn ' t seem to know where it was .

Great hotel , fantastic location Have just got back from 4 nights at the Sofitel and cannot fault this Hotel . Although the rooms are a little small they are spotless and the bathrooms more than make up for the smaller bedrooms . The attention to detail is great and nothing was to much trouble for the staff , including a late check out at short notice and for no extra charge - but the main thing about this hotel is the location ! 2 mins from Times square , right next to 5th Avenue and the list goes on and on - nearly all the main sites are within working distance and if not the subway is only 5 mins away . The best place for breakfast is the Red flame diner a couple of doors away and if your looking for a nice relaxed beer in an unpretenious bar then Virgils just down the street is great with friendly bar staff and great BBQ food .####[([14], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([23], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([23], [30], 'POS'), ([23], [40, 41], 'NEG'), ([33], [34, 35, 36, 37], 'POS'), ([57], [44, 45, 46, 47, 48], 'POS'), ([57], [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71], 'POS'), ([4], [84, 85, 86, 87, 88], 'POS'), ([4], [103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111], 'POS')]
