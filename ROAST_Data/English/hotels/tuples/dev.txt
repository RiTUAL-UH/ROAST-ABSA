Good Service but Loud The location is quite convienent with many good restaurants in the neighborhood. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. On dinner recommendations they were 4 for 4 and they greeted every request with a smile. The main negative is the room was very loud, although being from NYC it did not prevent me from sleeping. Also, the room was a bit small.####[['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'conflict'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Well located, phone booth size accomodations Moved here from hotel on North St. Great location, near shops and food and fun. Anyone over 6 foot tall will find a great deal ofdifficulty in the elfin beds. Rooms were clean but very, verysmall. I just had the feeling that 4 or 5 wealthy local students withdeep pockets decided to do this place as a thesis project.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Superb Hotel Me and my wife stayed in the Intercontinental in Singapore for 2 nights in our Honeymoon Trip around Asia and Pacific. The Staff is excellent as well as the service and the Breakfest Buffet (fantastic!!). The room is large with all new and modern amenities. Marble Bathroom is with a separate Walk-in Shower and Bath Tub. Air conditioning was a little too cold for us but was ok. We enjoyed very much our stay and we highly recommend this top class hotel, close to Underground Station and Market and Food court.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities comfort', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive']]
City Convenience we stayed here as a lay over on our way home. The avenue is about a ten minute walk from the station and allowed us to leave our luggage all day so that we could go round the city long before we could check in. It is within 5 minutes of Dam square and really well placed on one of the main tram routes. The rooms were small but clean and all of the staff really friendly. bar prices were very reasonable for a hotel.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
ice hotel, beware of $26 parking/valet fee!!! Great location, clean comfy stylish room, great service, nice views, but I was so put off by the $26 parking fee.

Best hotel in San Fransisco Stayed in The Argonaut on our honeymoon, everything was new, clean and well furnished - staff were really helpful and the hotel felt luxurious. Negotiate with the front desk - they gave us a discount. Checked into the Sheritan first and checked straight out - disgusting place - depressing rooms, in diar need of refurbishment and also very noisy (we were put in a room right by the bus station!).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
ok, but not great Given the reviews, we were expecting more than the Lazy Parrot turned out to have to offer. The room was ok, but needed updating and we never did get hot water in the shower. The Smilin' Joe's was closed for 'remodeling'. They're in the process of building an additional building next door, so while the pool was open, it really wasn't usable.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative']]

Great choice! Our family of 8 people stayed 3 nights and loved the friendly, homey, feeling of the hotel. The staff is most accommodating, the location is excellent, the rooms are clean and remind you of Old World design. Having an open buffet round the clock added much to our comfort.

Good value weekend break When we stayed, they did a special weekend rate of 85 euros pp for three nights including breakfast arriving on Friday and leaving on Monday which offered good value for money. We had a spacious and well equipped fourth floor bedroom at the quiet back of the hotel. Only downside is that the breakfast area can get congested at peak times. Good location in a quiet area and convenient for buses and trains. Just 200m from both KaDeWe store and the tourist office in the Europa Centre.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'neutral'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great location Great Location, check in was very quick, asked for high floor which we had. King size room, everything you needed apart from tea and cooffee, but I did know this and took my own kettle etc. We were on the 28th floor, I think you need to be at least this high to avoid traffic noise. The bar was very friendly, also served snacks. Hotel Staff very helpful.

Difficult to find fault The Barcelona Universal is not the largest hotel, or the best equipped or in the best location but it did offer friendly and efficient service, a very modern and up to date decor, large and comfortable rooms, all in a convenient location close to the centre and right next to a metro and bus stops. The Universal gave us everything we needed for a weeks sightseeing in Barcelona : Breakfast that ran till 11.00am just in case we'd had a late night, a sun terrace on the roof with a (small) pool and gymnasium, although we didnt try the restaurant in the evenings preferring to enjot Barcelonas excellent nightlife. Its great value for money and if you are looking for a safe bet, with good service and a convenient location look no further####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'conflict'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'negative']]
One of the Best Hotels in Asia We have traveled all over asia, and not many of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at were as nice, attentive, and beautiful as this one. The concierge was very helpful, room service wasn't extremely overpriced, and the front desk staff was excellent. The room was BEAUTIFUL, it had the best furnishings out of any room I have ever stayed at. We were staying in the basic room for 107 a night, and were amazed. Vaulted ceilings, dark contrasting colored furnishings, beautiful lobby, GREAT location for tourists. The Regent has it all.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive']]
Definately Recommend Nicely renovated hotel, three great pools to choose from. My tip would be to check the hotel sites specials, we were American Express cardholders so we got a free upgrade, 75$ resort credit,  complimentary bottle of wine. I would recommend a little restaurant right down the street called Hacienda, we got breakfast there almost every morning for like 7 bucks a person it was really good food with an excellent view!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
perfectly clean and modern, perfect location I absolutly loved hotel perseo! It was the perfect location, less then a block from the beautifull duomo, awesome shopping all around. The staff was so sweet and helpfull and spoke perfect english. They offered to make reservations for the Uffuzia and Accedemia for me , before i even thought to ask which enabled me to sail right in while the lines streched down and around the corner! The lift was broke one day, but only for a couple hours.

FIRST CLASS Surpirsed my husband for a birthday-Easter~Yankess/White Sox opener weekend getaway in April. There is no finer hotel in New York City. The Ritz Carlton~Central Park has superior service, amenities and ambiance. Our Park View Room on the 19th floor overlooking Central Park was magical. From the concerige services, room decor, frette linens, club level amenities, Central Park location/view and overall luxury melted our hearts with pleasure.

not what I expected The hotel was clean, the view was nice and the location right in front of Shinagawa station perfect but the room was cramped even though we went for the upgraded double.

Not all rooms are up to par I am a regular guest at Hilton-family properties, and although there were some nice aspects of my Mar 27th stay, it was hardly worth the price paid. Good points: very friendly staff, and terrific restaurantBad points: the room was dated - old rundown furniture, warped bathtub, stained bedding. I was only offered a double-queen suite in the main building, which seems to be the issue - apparently there are much better rooms available - so be careful when making arrangements. Overall, I've had much better accomodations at Embassy Suites and Doubletrees in the hilton family. Next time, I would stay elsewhere in the area, and just drive over to dine at the Different Pointe of View restaurant.####[['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative'], ['room_amenities quality', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Great downtown location Fantastic location - right in the centre of the shopping part of downtown, with acess directly into the Westlake shopping centre and great transport links. Room was not huge but adequately sized and clean. Doors on hotel rooms were on sprung hinges and tended to slam a bit, and walls were on the thin side, but these were minor issues. Staff were helpful and friendly - restaurant was pricey but the food did smell pretty good. Good food nearby at Changs (in Westlake) and microbrew pubs in both Rainier Square and Pacific Place. Would gladly stay here again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Fine Hotel in rather an unusual setting Finding this hotel in the midst of a rather run down area of Barcelona was a bit of a disappointment, but as we explored we found we could walk to the sea in 10 minutes, and to Port Vell via the promenade in 20minutes, which improved the whole situation. The hotel is really quite plush, the rooms had everything we needed, and we were impressed to find that soft drinks in room fridge were replaced daily free! The staff were very helpful, and knowledgeable about Barcelona and where to go. The only possible discontent was that breakfast was definitely better some days than others,but the Menu del Dia which started badly improved rapidly each day, and at 18 euros for 3 courses plus a bottle of wine , and a bottle of water, wasn't to be turned down. It is definitely a hotel I would visit again, particularly as we now understand that the whole area will be refurbished over the next couple of years.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['food_drinks prices', 'positive']]
Ocean Resort Hotel Wakiki isn't great The location is good, right in Waikiki, close by the Honolulu Zoo, the price is one of the lowest online, but you really don't know what it really like till you stay here. They were in the process of changing the card key access, so we had to get new cards. There's two small swimming pools with astro turf, the room view was of the next building, the food in the hotel restaurant as the hotel itself was uninspiring. Threre's nothing really bad, just all second rate, and simply a disappointing experience to stay here. I wouldn't want to stay here here again nor can I recommend this place to anyone.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'neutral'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'neutral']]

Bargain and convenient location For years, I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only. The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room. The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front. if, like me, you juts need a place to sleep and shower, the beds could be better but the water has always been hot, and it is a bargain! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here, but I am barely in the room, so why pay more? I will be spending my 3rd vacation there in 2 weeks.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Don't arrive late or you will not get your room Booked here because of rating on Trip Advisor. I had a reservation for a room with a large bed. When I arrived I was told that all they had left was a room with two smaller beds. They did find a room with one large bed, in the smoking rooms, but it was very small and the only window overlooked the front lobby. For 140 Euro, I expected a lot more.

Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers. the room was perfect, great space which is unusual for New York, beautiful view, excellent location. The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor. The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly. But the reception area is really nice. So it is a good option to spend some in NY and feel at home but don't expect too much from the staff.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks prices', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'conflict']]

harming! We picked this hotel based on the reviews here for our 2 night stay in early May 2005 and we were not disappointed. We had room #11, which was difficult to reach down small spiral stairs and was a bit worn, but I suppose that is part of the charm of this lovely bed and breakfast. We had a view of the canal and enjoyed watching boats pass by. The breakfast room is beautifully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful.

Lovely hotel The exterior of the Fairmont Copley has always struck me as grandiose and charming, so of course I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay there. The lobby is absolutely exquisite, and the staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms didn't quite measure up to my expectations based on the exterior and lobby as the one I stayed in was on the smaller side. However, the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen and the overall decor was stylish and clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for a pricier hotel for a weekend stay in Boston, close to many opportunities for great shopping,entertainment, and activities.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great post cruise stay We booked a room at the San Juan Marriott for two nights after returning from a cruise to extend our vacation a few days (before going back to work  reality). We were in the first group to leave the ship, so we arrived at the hotel at 9:30am! The staff couldn't have been friendlier. They directed us to the health club to change into our bathing suits, and we sunned at the beach  had a delicious lunch in the hotel until our room was available at about 2:30pm. We especially enjoyed the following: our very large and comfortable tower room, uncrowded beach, health club facilities, and good restaurants within walking distance. I recommend the hotel for a great pre- or post-cruise stay in San Juan.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views. When we got there, 3/4 of the view was of the blank brick wall of the adjoinging building but they still considered and charged as a water view. When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it. Disappointing service and attention - we would have strongly preferred accurate representations of what to expect even if it meant higher room rates.

Breakfast was good and we had the opportunity to talk to others on 4 seater tables. Both the owners and their manager, Pierpaolo, were extremely helpful with directions, bookings, suggestions etc. Good value too.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Great Area in Boston We had to take our son to Boston Children's Hospital and this hotel is extremely close by. The amenities of this hotel are great and accomodating especially after a long day in the hospital. The bar area was great, the food court attached had everything for somebodies taste and the hotel was close to the train, Fenway Park and tons of other neat attractions. At one point during our visit, the hotel had to shut down the water( not their fault however an inconvenience) and our A/C did not work the greatest. However the rooms were clean and comfortable.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Never ever again This resot is terrible not sure how it is rated 4 * it shoud be 2*+ maximum 3 *, I was there january 9 2005 and the pool was freezing it was impossible to swim , the food was terrible always cold, the service is very bad no one communicates in engish, the rooms do not get clean every day, the beach is ok but to many people try to sell you something and do not leave you alone, the entertaiment is a joke,overall just a bad place to go, wouldn't go there for FREE.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'negative']]
Handlery great but!!! Myself and 4 Girlfriends stayed in The Handlery Hotel for 4 nights, we had booked a twin and triple room on arrival we were upgraded to the club section with interconnecting doors Fantastic location a lovely hotel, I would recommend to anyone except for one thing the staff are not very friendly in particular the bar staff. We found them very rude no way helpful and if they could avoid serving us they would. I would still stay there again as the location and hotel were first class. Probably avoid having a drink!!!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
We loved it! Enjoyed a 5 day visit in August. Loved San Francisco, loved Nob Hill Motor Inn. Accommodation was clean and comfortable, good value, very central, good shops, bars and restaurants close by. Best point was the friendly staff, they provided endless info on local attractions and were generally helpful throughout our stay. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Great location for an Amsterdam stopover The other reviews are right, the hotel is close to everything - trains, RLD, restaurants, shopping, etc. Reasonably clean - not spotless. We stayed on the first floor and the room while adequate was tired. Breakfast was excellent and security good. We didn't encounter any problems with Charlie boys hassling us. We would recommend this hotel for a one or two night stay.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

>What a treasure As an hotelier I tend to be super critical of other hotels but I would have a hard time faulting the Beacon so much so that I will be returning next month. Tastefully decorated, spacious and clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff and a FANTASTIC market right across the street to stock up if you just want to chill out in your room and watch TV or get a late start with breakfast in your room!The location is ideal as it is close to everything you could possibly want to do in the Big Apple and there really is no need to take cabs as the subway is minutes away. I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return next month.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
Loved it Booked solely from the reviews from this site, and the hotel lived up to expectations! Very very friendly staff who couldnt do enough to help. We originally booked a quad room for ourselves and our two children, but soon realised how safe the hotel was - lots of CCTV cameras around, so felt comfortable changing to two rooms - the children are 10 and thought it was a great adventure having their own room! Breakfast great - kids first time in Amsterdam and loved the food! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again, having stayed at a couple of others which were far more expensive and far less personable.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Excellent choice for business or leisure travel I stay at this hotel on a regular basis for business travel to Washington. The hotel is conveniently located (about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro), the staff is friendly and accomodating, and the suites are comfortable and well laid out. The 32'' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus. Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items (eggs, omelets, etc) and an evening cocktail reception, both of which are fantastic. The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro (about a 5-10 minute ride).####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive']]
Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel. The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying. The bedroom was small, but intimate with everything a girl would want.... voluminous pillows, the finest sheets, and a comforter that you wanted to wrap yourself in along side your bed mate. You will be extremely pleased with the decor, the comfort, and the extras that are found in the room.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'conflict'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Pretty good indeed Bali as many good and great hotels, so Laguna had to meet the expectations, and mostly it did. My room was large with a raised platform and balcony facing the pool. Service was mostly impeccable. My only 2 small grouses were that check-in was long and that it was difficult to find a sundeck chair by the pool. It would have helped if staff was on hand to help guests find available chairs.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]
Welcoming and friendly staff, elegant hotel I traveled to New Orleans recently was gratful that I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and assisted me with every aspect of my travel, from directions to the local attractions - to recommendations for local restaurants. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, with antique brick walls and elaborate, lush curtains. My favorite part of the hotel (besides the amazing staff), was the location. It is located quite close to all of the major local attractions (the steamboat tours, downtown New Orleans, The French Quarter, etc).When I return, I would definitely go back to this hotel.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
ice hotel, but beware The front desk staff were very nice. The breakfast buffet was tasty. However, the bathroom faucet had a very loud and obnoxious jack-hammer noise whenever turned on.

Interesting comfortable base in Seattle Really enjoyed my time here. Interesting decor with unique touches everywhere. Was super clean and tidy, bathrooms (although shared) were spacious, very clean and always available.

Personally.. . They have an excellent personal service, I wish that they mentioned however that breakfast was not included, because I had to pay 12 euros per head. Apart from that, I loved the room. Although it was on the 3rd floor it was a quiet room and the location is perfect for shoppers!

Melia bali - Honeymoon Just returned fro a 2 week stay at the melia and we have not a bad word to say about this fantastic hotel or this beauiful island. Nusa dua is located to the south of the island around half an hour from the airport, Nusa dua is also very safe and secure with every vehicle being checked over by security guards as you enter through the gates and again when you enter the hotel grounds, But please do not be worried about walking round in bali as it is all very safe and friendly, There are some fantastic authentic resturants just outside the nusa dua gates or for a good resturant inside the gates there is a shopping center called bali collection which has a free shuttle bus from all the hotels ( just ask at reception)The Hotel is set in a fantastic location right on the beach the rooms are very nice and spacious with a very traditional modern balinese feel which is carried on through the hotel there are also many resturants in the hotel grounds, Styles include japanese medeterainian, tapas and world cusine. Our stay at the melia was truley unforgettable and bali is such a fantastic island.

Great hotel Just returned April 9 pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews. Hotel staff beginning with Dominic at the front desk to Hiriam and Rodney at the swim up bar, were helpful, friendly and entertaining. Our room in the tower was a little small for two double beds but very clean and updated. The view alone is worth the visit! Restaurants and cocktails are a little pricey but no worse than other islands I've visited. Oh and the spa...if you can fit it in do so, the perfect end to a great island vacation.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'conflict'], ['food_drinks prices', 'conflict'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Absolutely brilliant... Myself and my girlfriend stayed 3 nights at this hotel just recently. I can highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the brilliant city of Barcelona. It is a two minute walk to La Ramblas and only a little further to some of the main attractions (such as Gaudi buildings).The staff were excellent, the breakfast was good and the room was perfect. If we go back to Barcelona, we won't stay anywhere else.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Very acceptable and friendly choice We stayed at the Elizabeth for three nights. Despite the other reviews which might scare you off, we found the staff friendly and very responsive, room was clean and in good shape, and only a few very minor issues. Whenever we called, someone was at our door in 5 minutes or less (e.g. extra blankets and pillows). This hotel is conveniently located to Orchard Road and Mt. Elizabeth Hospital and reasonably priced for Singapore. About the only drawback is that the bathtub was difficult to access for a senior---though there were plenty of grab bars.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]

Good service, great location, fantastic pool I was supposed to stay just for one night, but I end up staying for two and luckily because I've just met the amazing pool on the second day. It's a fantastic pool, on the 16th floor, and that has an all year round temperature of 27 degrees. The location is also great and the prices not as high as many of its competitors. Besides the rooms are spacious and full of small details that make our stay very pleasant.

Great Resort, Mediocre Food The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs offers fantastic suites, pools and golf, but the restaurants fall very short in terms of food preparation. The suites at PHTC are roomy, clean, quiet and offer great views. We stayed 3 days at this resort and would definitely stay again, but would avoid the restaurants. The staff at the Resort are super helpful (and this includes the restaurant staff), but the 3 different resataurants we ate at (on property) were mediocre at best.

Good Value/Location As far as hotels in Amsterdam go, it is a great value. The hotel is clean, provides comfortable accommodations, and is in a great location to get to museums.

Elegant bargain Lovely hotel, clean and new due to recent remodelling, which seems to be completed. (As of 12/07 there is some construction on the east side of the hotel, but it does not affect hotel access.) Breathtaking views of Hudson River and WTC site. Close to Tribeca, subway, and steps from train station at WTC.You can get great deals directly from their website, probably to build up business again after remodel. Highly recommended.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Loved the Location I was warned that it was away from the city centre. My check in was handled reasonably smooth and the room was a decent size. The staff were very courteous. There is a market place on the other side but this does not cause any disturbance. The tram stop is just across the road and most of the sites are accessible quickly.

Sleeping Easy in the Big Easy After getting a great rate on Hotwire ($103 for three consecutive nights during a convention) I was very pleased arriving in a traditional W hotel. It had all the things you expect to find: a hip rockin' lounge, stylish goth lobby, and a surprisingly friendly and inviting staff. Even with a Hotwire booked reservation, the staff honored my platinum Starwood membership and upgraded me to a huge suite (three of us got upgraded separately). The room was typical W, meaning all the comfort you expect (big, soft bed with great linens, awesome shower, and plasma TV's).The staff was always gracious and trying to help.####[['hotel comfort', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

The workout room on the top floor was nice and well apportioned and the pool (also on the top floor) had nice views of the city/river.

Listen to Trip Advisor!!!! We did a lot of research before going and wanted someplace that was in a good central location, and was not too expensive. Following the good reviews on TA, we made reservations at the Nob Hill Motor Inn. Everything said about this place is true.

They not only run a great hotel, but they will help however they can to make your vacation great.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]

The room was spacious very clean and comfortable, the location was great ( great for museums and sightseeing, right next to one of the main stations and on one of the main streets but they have very good sound proofing so you would never know!)There are a few decent eating/ drinking places literally over the road, built under the railway. a couple are German style and one is Italian - we ate at a couple of them and they were really good (you do get the thunder of trains every so often tho!)I would also recommend a meal at Dressler on the Unter den Linden (about 5 - 10 mins walk away) it's very nice and the staff are lovely.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]

Excellent Location The hotel is very conveniently placed and is only a two minute walk from the Duomo. The majority of the reception staff spoke good English and were always polite and friendly. The rooms are small but clean, the views are far from spectacular and the furnishings are basic. However, if you plan to spend most of your time out and about in Florence rather than in your hotel room, the Hotel Gioia proves excellent value for money.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Good Hotel Just returned from Hong Kong, where I resided five days at the Langham Place, inspired by the reviews on this site. I decided to stay at this hotel not only because of the overall favorably opinions but mainly because of the rapport between quality and price, which turned out to be excellent. For a good hotel with great amenities and services, it was reasonable. I am not a fan of huge hotels of this type, but I found that the service was maintained on all levels. I loved the spa and the outdoor pool which was big enough with an amazing view.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
A Steal!!!!!!! Compared to the congestion, noise, cheeseball tourists and double rates at the Caribe Hilton and the San Juan Hotel, this place is great! Centrally located, friendly staff, and quiet rooms. If you want to eat, you can walk next door to the Hilton and use them for their restaurants, then walk across the street for ice cream. FREE internet service ands a great pool.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive']]
Great location across Arno River Hotel Silla is a great find across the river from all the main sights in Florence. Their customer service is top notch, they are always willing to answer questions, recommend a restaurant or reserve an entrance to a museum or tourist attraction. They provide free internet access in the lobby, and their breakfast is terrific! Also, enjoy a bottle or glass of wine outside on the terrace in the evening. It's generally quiet, but be aware that on a weekend evening, it can get loud as there are a few restaurants  bars on the block where locals party. We had a great stay, and would return to Hotel Silla again.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'conflict']]
Wonderful stay!! We stayed for 7 nights in the condos. Staff was very nice. Our rooms had great view of Waikiki Beach. We had our 10 month old with us and the extra large rooms enabled her to practice her walking without bumping into everything.

Green credentials This is a new hotel that claims a range of green features, some of which seemed to be stretching the point somewhat. However it was a pleasant stay with particularly firendly and helpful staff. Minus points were the size of the bedroom (small); a sliding door on the bathroom that didn't have any pretence at privacy; high bar prices ($14 for a glass of wine) and exorbitant parking charges ($37 per day) when there were public facilities on the same block (for $24 a day.)Overall, good but not exceptional enough to make me want to go back. Darrin, the bar steward would make me want to go back though, just for the entertainment value. He was a scream!####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities prices', 'negative'], ['hotel miscellaneous', 'positive']]
High marks to the Antiche Figure We were delighted to stay at this hotel. Location is very convenient to Venezia Santa Lucia train station and it was a great relief to get off the train, cross the bridge, and get to our hotel so fast. The reception staff was charming and very helpful. The room was very clean although not very spacious. Breakfast in the tables that face the canal was a big plus.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative']]
Elevator Safety Issues!! All three of the south bank of elevators malfunctioned the entire four days we were there! One group of guests was stuck in elevator #3 for over an hour and a half. My wife and I got stuck between floors twice in elevators #1 and 2 two days in a row when the electronics suddenly just went dead. After fiddling with the buttons it started up again each time after about five minutes. I believe these sorts of maintenance/safety issues are unforgivable in a hotel this expensive and we will not be staying there again!####[['facilities quality', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]

Great value, friendly staff This was the first stop of our honeymoon, and we very much enjoyed our stay at Amstelzicht. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and we found the room to be satisfactory and clean. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but if you are looking for clean accomodations that present good value in Amsterdam, I highly recommend this hotel. The stairs are difficult to negotiate, so I would not recommend the hotel to those with physical disabilities. Otherwise though, we had a fabulous time, and there is a great restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.####[['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['location general', 'positive']]
Great Location Shabby Room Although the Ambassador was well located,had a pleasant and helpful staff, and good food service, I will probably not stay there again. My single room was shabby with wallpaper peeling off the wall, a clean but threadbare carpet,and dated furniture. As a single traveller, I was only allowed one pillow on the double bed and one towel in the bath. The ventilation in the lobby was poor so the cigarette smoke was toxic.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['service general', 'conflict'], ['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative']]
a terrible experience The worst nightmare I 've ever lived. My wife got a severe food poison for which we've spent 3 nights in a hospital in punta cana. You'll probably say was just our bad luck but then why the hospital was full with ppl with the same problem and most of them from the same resort(melia caribe tropical)?Service is bad too and very few exceptions didn't change the overall impression. At the end a group of ppl from th hospital we've decided to send a formal letter through a lawyer to general manager of the Melia Caribe /Tropical.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['food_drinks quality', 'negative'], ['service general', 'negative']]
Excellent location; good value for money Very friendly and competent staff; very clean; free wifi access to the internet is a definite bonus; truly lilliputian rooms (at least the single room I had) but then this is Amsterdam...; breakfast OK but nothing to write home about; thin-walled so earplugs are a must if you have no desire to listen to your neighbour's tv programmes; overall good enough value for money for Amsterdam (in absolute terms though 90 euros per night is really expensive for such a small room... it really is just for sleeping and showering ;) )####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'conflict'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms prices', 'negative']]
Great location A great location within walking distance of interesting sites. Not too far from an American Express office which came in handy.

amazing holiday where the bad reviews come from for this hotel i do not know because i had a fantastic time in this lovely resort. the food was beautiful, the scenery was lovely and the staff are amazing, utterly amazing. they would get games of football going or volleyball or take you away to learn spanish or do a poolside game, the bar staff are all lovely, waiters in the buffet area were very hardworking where nothhing was too much hassle. all the differant workers here wear uniforms so you know exactly who to see about anything.the pool was great with balls supplied and goalposts in the pool and on the beach, from my room both the pool and beach were less than a minutes walk away. best holiday i have ever had####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['rooms miscellaneous', 'positive']]
A Perfect base We have just returned from our first NY visit and stayed at the Casablanca for four nights, largely on the basis of good reviews. We were not disappointed. The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms which I had read were small were no smaller than most city hotels ,Rick's Cafe with the complimentary breakfast, all day tea/coffee muffins newspapers and evening cheese /wine was an oasis of sanity and the location is very convenient (walkable for most first visit sightseeing). We would strongly recommend this hotel unless you want the fitness club/swimming pool/restaurant type experience of a large chain hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive']]

Great location, nice people We just got back from a 4-night stay in Room 4 on the top floor, and encountered a grand total of one mosquito in our room. No problems with that at all.

Our room looked out to a brick wall and was a little on the dark side but our friends room had a massive window and looked out on the street which meant it was nice and light [ask for a room with a big window]A good breakfast- loads to choose from served in the tapas barWould def stay there agai####[['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]

great location Stayed here for a convention at a reduced rate. Room had a high quality 42 inch HD TV and was very comfortable. Excellent location close to Moscone convention center, restaurants, cable car, and shopping. I really enjoyed Yerba Buena Garden right next to it and the bar with a terrific view on the 39th floor. My only complaint is that there are three sets of elevators going to different floors which was confusing for the first day or two.

Best to book on priceline, select 4 star and put a price of $80-90/night, more than likely you will get this, its one of the very few 4 star hotels in AMS taht is on priceline.

decent hotel As others have said, this place is nothing special, but for the price and location, it's actually very special. The actual room is a perfectly adequate budget motel room, except that our room had a view of coit tower, transamerica building, and the rest of downtown sf. From what I could see, other more expensive hotels near the area probably can't claim to have the view that we did. And that also means that you can walk to all kinds of great places and take the bus to others. Now if the kind people at the Columbus could only bring some sunshine and warmth to the city, then you would really have something.####[['hotel general', 'neutral'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive']]

Fantastic Value After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value.

Beware the Annex Booked to stay in another hotel in Amsterdam in May 2003 but got changed at last minute by the internet booking company we used (think they may have gone out of business now as can't find them any more) to the Hotel Piet Hein. When we arrived thought nice hotel, only to discover that we had been booked into the hotel's annex which was a few doors down the same street. Absolute nightmare of a room, up three flights of very steep stairs, room very dirty, ripped curtains, mould in bathroom, stained carpets, etc. Didn't get our own key to the door of the annex but had to ask at main reception for someone to come along and let us in. In short, not somewhere I would reccomend. That said, things may have changed in the Annex as it was a few years ago, but beware when booking, make sure its the main hotel which is really nice.####[['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'negative']]

Circular Quay is also where the Opera House and the Ferries are located allowing easy access to all of Syndney, including the Rocks area, Harbor Bridge, shopping, Rocks market, and ferries to Manly and everywhere else. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of a number of restaurants in the Rocks area. The room provided was better than average for Marriott, with all amenities and nice shower.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
great location Location is great, near corner of Orchard and Scotts. Club lounge is nice, although no hot offering at breakfast, which although ok for my wife, expect a hot offering at Grand Hyatt Grand Clubs (best is in HK). Stayed in a junior suite with wife and two kids (combo business and holiday). Great room, plenty of space, although bed is very firm (westin heavenly beds are clearly superior). Would stay agai####[['location general', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'neutral'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Great choice in the Quarter Stayed here for four nights and would choose this hotel again. If your looking for a clean room, near Bourbon Street, friendly staff, at a good price - this is the place. I also was in and out of a few other hotels were relatives were staying, if your looking for four elevators, and a large lobby, and all the stuff that comes with a large big name hotel - you aren't going to get it at the St. Marie. I'd recommend it as a great place to stay for a great price.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Disapointed Stayed here now lots of times this year and always loved the hotel and looked forward to staying in it. Sadly this time was a disapointment and although it's a good standard hotel it's no longer that great. Such a large range of hotels in Londn in this price band that you need that extra something to want to stay in them and this hotel has sadly now lost that. Now seems full of coch parties, meetings over breakfast tables and slightly cuttig corners. A real shame.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'negative']]
Great stopover We stopped over in Singapore on our way to Bali and decieded to stay at the Fullerton for our second time in 2 years. What we love about the hotel is the it is such are great contrast to what ever else is going on around it in such an elegant way. Everything from the bathroom amenities to the service is fantastic and we both defintaly love this hotel and cannot recommend it enough.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
Location, Location, Location Located on Restaurant Row and near the major theaters, this boutique hotel has nicely furnished rooms (new plasma TV's)at an incredibly good price. Mike at the front desk is exceptionally helpful with restaurants and touring. Heater controls were hard to locate and there was little info available on use of phones, etc. but these were small oversights for such a comfortable stay. We had three rooms for five days (in both of the hotel's two buildings) and everyone was content. Would return in a minute.####[['location general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms prices', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'negative']]
ultra trendy but lame This ultra trendy new money hotel played loud dance/house music until 9pm every night and it was impossible to take any kind of nap or relax in the middle of the day. The hotel seemed very fake and tried to be hip. The rooms were very comfortable with nice pillows and comfy bed though. Overall, there are many better choices and I cant understand why anyone would want to stay there.####[['hotel general', 'conflict'], ['hotel comfort', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive']]
Left after 1 night I lasted one night - the room was tiny, barely lit, musty and just unbearable. Traveling on a student budget I didn't want to splurge too much and thought Mango would be decent - I ended up at the Green Isle inn next door which was MUCH better and only a few bucks cheaper####[['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative']]
It'll be great when it's finished! We stayed here for one night at the end of March due to a mix up with our booking at the Eiffel Seine Hotel. We were most impressed by the quality of the decoration and fittings in our room - the large comfortable bed, the flat screen TV with internet access and the Versace bathroom. Loved the designer cups in the cosy breakfast room. The refurbishment looks to be almost complete as the reception area was being painted whilst we were there. Highly recommended.####[['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Wouldn't recommend it. This Hotel looks great online. Although the price is right, it doesn't make up for the cleanliness. The shared washrooms were dirty, and most all the architectural details were very worn. I have stayed at much nicer places for the same price. I would not recommend this hotel.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'negative'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative']]
Woud return We stayed in 306. Need to at higher 06 room to get an ocean view. Staff was pleasant and attentive. Computer and lighting system in room is great.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['room_amenities general', 'positive']]
first meet of Dallas It had a nice outdoor swimming pool outside. The rooms are big. The lobby is large enough to hold a hundred people. It was there that I met my America family.####[['facilities general', 'positive'], ['facilities design_features', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive']]
Very nice place to stay I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The staff was very pleasant and always eager to accomodate. The hotel was very well maintained. The food was excellent. It was nicer than most places I have stayed in New York- and the people were a whole lot friendlier. I would definitely go back####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['hotel quality', 'positive']]
The beds are hard!! If you don't like hard beds then this is not the place for you. The bed was like sleeping on a slab of concrete, which I suppose is OK if you like your mattress firm. Other than the horrid bed which totally spoiled my stay this place was modern, very clean and offered friendly service.####[['rooms quality', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive']]
A great find We very much enjoyed our stay here. The staff were friendly and helpful, room was very clean and the hotel is in a great location. We particularly enjoyed the abundance of restaurants and bars in the locality and the fact that everything was within walking distance. We would definitely go back again.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
You will not be disapointed A very nice 4 star hotel. Me and my wife loved the swimming pools (especially the hot water with jakuji pool). Breakfasts were very good with lots of options. Staff was very polite and helpful. Also the location of the hotel was easy to travel to and from any place. A clean and nice place to stay with an average price.####[['hotel quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
Not for me Didn't really like this hotel due to the lack of en suite facilities, however we knew this before checking in. The room we had was very basic, had no safe, was tiny and despite being at the rear of the hotel, were subjected to noise during the night like there were dishes being constantly smashed. The hotel is well situated for Market Street and Powell Street and is fine if you're looking for an economy hotel and economy it certainly is.####[['hotel general', 'negative'], ['rooms general', 'negative'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['rooms comfort', 'negative'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel prices', 'positive']]
Nice Hotel I stayed at the Peninsula in Sept for a weekend. The rooms we nice and clean - nothing spectacular. The restuarants at the hotel are good as well. Generally a nice western style hotel.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['rooms cleanliness', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'negative'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'positive']]
Nice Room, Great Service We visited July 2004 - The room was aa great size, so was the marble bathroom. The staff was excellent, they made all of our reservations and arrangments. The roomdecor could use updating but all in all it was agood experience.####[['rooms general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms design_features', 'positive'], ['hotel general', 'positive']]
friendly and clean On our arrival at the hotel we were treated in a very friendly manner, given a load of sight seeing maps and brochures, and a general rundown of where all the sights and shopping centres were, which we found to be most helpful. The hotel itself although small was clean and served a lovely breakfast (buffet), it also had on line facilities and library with daily newspapers. A few minutes walk took us to rembrandt plein where a large choice of restaurants were to be found, also the shops on rokin and kalverstraat are nearby, making the hotel very central but not noisey. We had a great 5 days in Amsterdam made more enjoyable by the hotel staff who went out their way to make our stay as carefree and pleasant as possible. A big thankyou to all at the hotel for giving us a fine experience of Holland and Amsterdam.####[['service general', 'positive'], ['location general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['hotel cleanliness', 'positive'], ['food_drinks quality', 'positive'], ['facilities general', 'positive'], ['hotel comfort', 'positive']]
Our worries melted away when we stepped through the door Making reservations at a hotel we had never seen gave my boyfriend and I a degree of pause. We were not sure what to expect. We could not have been more impressed with the atmosphere and service. The room was tidy and comfortable. If you go to New Orleans and you want to experince the style of the Quarter, skip the chain places and stay here. Say hi to Leonard for us.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['service general', 'positive'], ['rooms quality', 'positive'], ['rooms comfort', 'positive']]
Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October, our second stay there, and it was lovely. If possible, ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias. We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain, the cathedrals and the hillsides around town. The restaurant, Mark's, is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island. The hotel is a little worn in places and the breakfast was not much to be desired, but otherwise a great place to stay.####[['hotel general', 'positive'], ['rooms general', 'positive'], ['hotel design_features', 'negative'], ['food_drinks style_options', 'negative']]
