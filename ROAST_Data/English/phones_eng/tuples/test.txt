Good choice  Everything is just awesome except battery. Battery should be more efficient, respectively it drains a little bit faster. Device is very slim and lightweight, feels premium in hand. If you are a casual user and want stylish phone, definitely go for it. You gonna love this phone.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Awesome phone, everything is good except battery and charging. Though it support 67 watt fast charging but it takes more than 55 minutes to charge fully. Battery backup is not good. But display, performance, design, camera are superb. This is a fascinating phone. Happy to have this phone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
The phone is cool everything is fine display camera performance everything is good but there should be some improvement in the battery because it runs less according to the capacity of the battery 24 hours backup is good but in gaming 3 to 4 hours is enough but the phone is very good.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
display is as beautiful as it is risky. As curved display are prone to break and this one doesn't have any gorilla glass protection. And curved tempered cost 5 times more than regular tempered glass. This model curved tempered cost me around 450 while flat tempered cost around 50.  Gaming - Average and display during gaming feels like watching it in 240p while setting is set to maximum. Forget even high graphics gaming if you could could game with terrible graphics then go for it.####[['display general', 'neutral'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
Rear camera is awesome but front camera is below standard even 4 years old redmi k20 pro has detail in selfie camera. Selfie camera picture at night is unusable. I regret how a so called flagship selfie camera is like 10000 phone selfie camera    Battery -is good    Performance -  I noticed a bit of lag in multitasking####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
It's a great and fully loaded handset. If you're looking to get something different and useful in this price range , so this will be an amazing option for you. Don't worry, you'll have great experience with it. Overall it's amazing and premium. It's too slip and light weighted.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]

Best mobile under 30k for photography and multimedia consumption. Screen is amazing with awesome cameras. Charging speed is also good with 66W charger included in the box.

Best phone with a premium feel.  Everyone in my friends and family are praising it.  Some people gave me offer to exchange their iPhone 13 with phone. Now you can understand the value and feel of this phone once you keep it in your hand and use it.  If you have budget then go for it without a single if and but####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
One of the best mid-range mobile. Portrait pictures are great, 120 refreshing rate feels amazing. Pubg, cod games can play 90fps. The display is fabulous and the processor is better than SD 778. Best part phone is very slim and light weight easy to handle and can use for long time with out any pain.  Cons: single mono speakers could be given a stereo dual speaker, 3.5mm jack missing, 4k 60fps recording missing in this era. The price is very high best to buy around 25k. Lots of bloatware ads####[['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive']]

It has superb camera and also it's light weighted.    Rest all are too bad.    Battery needs to charge twice in a day.    Mobile build quality is not good, it is vibrating during calls.

Disappointed.. mobile hang and restart very frequently. mobile data will not automatically start, I need to restart several times to use mobile data. Performance is like 15K Mobiles. Network performance is very poor.. there is huge lagging to getting sms. Apps performance is also bit slow.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
Look and Feel:  It's beautifully designed and light weighted phone. Although screen size is bigger but you dont feel any discomfort while holding it.  Color changing back is really feels good.    Battery:  If you are using phone for streaming videos it will usually drain in one day but when using for normal usage..battery life spans to 1.5 days    Performance:  I tried playing COD and it does not hang or heat up too much.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]

Unable to use my data, as my data connection is not working. Everytime I have to restart my phone to use my data connection and only for once its gets on and then again it doesn't turn on... Phone is lagging while playing only 1 game... UI should be better at this price range...

This is the trust issues and quality of your mobile  A common man can't buy such a thing. It is not not about your mobile the seller are included. 7day replacement policy is myth of the filpkart company.  This is not same filpkart i was know but there are prove to me wrong.  Thank you for your support and thank you for your the world worst mobile phone####[['platform general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Lowest performance with repeated app hangs.  Touch is again insensitive.  Only the camera works well.  Finishing looks good , we are not looking for display pieces !

1.Weak Hotspot (software issues or hardware)  2.Bad Speaker  3.120hz refresh rate is for scrolling the screen, Not Applicable in Any other activity  4. No use of dynamic ram  5. Processor is very weak one, Sd695 is even far better. For Gaming It is absolutely the worst one at this price segment, u may break ur phone.

Honestly this phone is just a game changer for its camera design and performance..literally feels premium in hand and the weight is evenly balanced..  Only downside of this phone is The funtouch os and  Single speaker . But single speaker is very load and clear and good one.. Battery also giving very long lasting backup due to 4nm chip and amaoled display..  You can take very good night shots and professional portraits as mentioned by Vivo..

Using this for last 1week,  So far very positive. Let's discuss the negatives first:  1. Speaker is loud, good quality but not stereo. In this price is a honest cutting from vivo.  2. Full of bloatware's, some significant effort a person needs to make all bloat apps uninstalled or permissions turned off.####[['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
1.Camera like DSLR  But portrait mode some time not working properly ( when sunlight day click) please slove this problem vivo🫤 2. Display OMG  awesome 3.

My honest review of the phone after 1 day of use .  camera clarity 4/5; decent camera quality at this price range. front camera quality above average. back camera quality pretty good. front and back camera video quality is amazing; good stability video phone build quality 5/5  phone design quality is very nice. battery backup is also good####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Nice product and it's camera is just amazing but slightly disappointed about it's processor in this price range there are mobiles which have mediatek 1300 chipset is also available, it is good for who don't go for intermediate gaming, but it's color changing effect is awesome .  Those guys who love photography can go for this device. In this price range the processor is not up to the mark, should have mediatek dimesity 1300 instead of 900.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
I have Vivo v15 pro and expected that it will have same camera as that. But it only have 64 and 50 mp camera but it's quality is like 15k phone camera. Though we take high resolution photos photo quality is not like that its post processing is not good and not as per Indian skin tones may be it's for Chinese skin tone. Literally very disappointed####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
camera was awesome but touch is not good as expected in such a price refresh rate is only 90 , touch was really not good it doesn't feel like we are running a new phone, brightness level is good it also had a feature of pre call recording notification and its very good looking phone it looks like an iphone, slippery back but sides are so cool to handle the device color is also good####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'neutral']]

I bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues. So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand. It has been a few days since I have been using this phone. I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good.  The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate.  The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah.  Charging is quite fast.  The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well.####[['phone usability', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
I'm not a gamer but i can say the gamer won't be that disappointed.  One issue i notice is that this phone comes with a few bloat ware which u can uninstall.  When you make carrier video calling have noticed a few issue.Might get addresses in the next update.  In one word you won't be disappointed. It is but pricey but with exchange if you get this phone by 20k to 25k this tat is a good deal.####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]

This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won’t be disappointed.    I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.    Best features with stunning looks & performance.    Battery life is very good. You need to manage couple of features in phone and phone works with optimum battery level throughout day.    Go for it even if you’re first time iOS user.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]

Totally worth the price if:    - you are a iOS fan  - like compact phone  - want to switch from android to iPhone  - you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)  - you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)  - you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)    There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (you can visit youtube for technical features).####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]

If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.    The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.    The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
People talk about it’s battery backup?? man I’m in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you’ve used both you’ll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I’ll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptic and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it. It’s super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.    Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24 hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you have got a bad habit to put off.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
My first iPhone and very happy with it. Slick and gorgeous design with perfect compact mobile. Performance is so amazing ,display softness more than 5 *. Little bit battery issues for fast drains like need to charge once in a 12 hours. May be this will solve out in next update. Definitely worth to buy than other brands.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.    There's a few things it could've done better:    1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.  2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.  3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement.  4. Fast charging####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!    Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me, I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind.    Switched from android. Never going back!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
Everything is fine of this mobile except battery.    Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness in  Video call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.  Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins.    Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
After using this Device as my daily driver for over a month i can say that , It’s inbuilt AI and Machine Learning is so good that it manages all my things by itself, and even after having a small battery of 1800 MAH, it performs all day with some juice left, which is impressive. Awesome Camera, amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic.  Suggestion go for 128GB it will help you in long run. Overall a very good and nice product.####[['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
This Phone is Simply Brilliant.The fastest mobile processor from Apple, A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat. The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation. Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor. Definetely a Value for your Buck.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu quality', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
First of all we will talk about battery it has 1800 mah battery ,but u know what it works like 4000 mah truly amazing phone with optical image stabilization in video with editing option 64 gb variant is too good go for it####[['phone general', 'positive']]
Battery will give good performance for a normal user  I suggest another variant for heavy users  Cam quality is good in day light conditions  Performance is very good with A13 Bionic chip  Small in size and don’t expect a screen size like MI or one plus full screen mobiles####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative']]
This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the 1800 mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.  Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with our bare eyes. I did not see any grains kicking in during low light conditions.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable. The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most. In single word this is the RED DAGGER for android flagships phones.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
The performance iss as expected great, the battery life is not actually a concern, but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww. Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager, with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20% left and you could get near to 80 ,. Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming, 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season.  Camera is good enough for the price don't expect flagship level performance, as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me.  Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros,  Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features,  And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .  You can buy this even for the mrp of the phone without hesitation .####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm.  The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design. Looks so good in white colour.  Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU.  If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it. But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed, CAMERA, looks, iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device.  Battery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don’t play games this device is giving me 5-6 hrs of usage time (you tube, camera,music, browsing,etc etc)  M using white colour with product red apple leather case. This is the perfect contrast with white colour.  Overall rating-8/10  just because of battery performance.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof..  Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it.  It is good for email surfing, browsing, couple of videos per day.  Camera quality is not superb but good in day light  Video is extraordinary i can say  Performance speed is tremendous  Battery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands.    White color stand unique in crowd.. because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets..  Can go for red one as well.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]
Mini Black Beast  Who likes handy best option with solid device and super fast performance  Battery stands for 4 to 5 hrs.

This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.    Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse. But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand.    Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run. It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game, battery will tale a hit.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Very nice phone. Actually it's my first iPhone so I was very excited. Nd I'm happy with this phone.  Nice phone for gaming, battery backup is not that much for gaming but I suggest buy one good powerbank or fast charger. If u have small fingers then it's best device for u.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get really good game play, worth the money, between if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not really that small, so buy it, it's perfect.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'neutral']]
It’s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I’ve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above. And it’s my first time experiencing ios, and it is extremely smooth and optimized.  Thanks.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary . The user interface and the camera is too good .Just in love with this extraordinary device .I just shared some photos clicked from this phone so that everyone can have an idea about how good the camera is compared all other flagship devices . The lens inside the device is so efficient that it automatically reduces the noise in the picture making it very crisp and clear .####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
Picture quality is amazing you do not need to think twice about buying this for performance and photos, just go for it. Bionic A 15 is super fast and it has amazing performance,  It is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user,  But if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]

It's just mind-blowing I have switched from Android to iOS it feels fantastic. The alluring effect and the fascinated color it's top notch.

It's a new iPhone! It's faster than the last ones I guess, and it should be good for the next 80k miles. The only gripes I might have, probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS. I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer, and it seems my screen isn't nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR. As I've said though, it's most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out. Still a nice piece of kit, yet no real surprises either. It does have a very nice camera for photos and video.####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
The most premium feeling I ever had while holding a phone was of this iphone 13.  This is my first iPhone apart from having ipad pro but i can guarentee you that it had the most premium in hand experience.  The flipkart service was awesome and it got delivered before expected date. Hats off!  Overall an excellent experience it was. An iphone is not hyped just for no reason.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Awesome product must buy. Well, switching from Android to iOS will make you a little uncomfortable as Siri can't understand Hindi. The most important I like about this phone is that Bgmi get opens within 11 to 13 seconds. Speaker is awesome, the display is fantastic, battery is 3200. And most important speed and camera are incredible. Check my photos. If you want to switch then don't buy iPhone 11 or 12 must go for 13 or 14. Well, I am leaving this review after using it for 1 week. I ordered it on 27 August and I received it on 8 October. Today is 13 October. Thanks, Flipkart for another awesome product. You have always resolved my issues and I have done 3-4 lac shopping from this platform till now still waiting for my next want. For now, it's enough ugh####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
I have been using this iphone for more than an month and i must say it is worth the money. It has a good battery as compared to other iphone versions, but obviously not as good as android. But the security feature is top notch. Totally satisfied with the buy.

The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s. The battery life is longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone).  Yes, the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land. But it’s more about what this chip lets you do. This includes Cinematic mode, which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus, and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive']]
Switched from android to iOS.  In hand feel of iPhone 13 is very good .. superb to be precise because of its 6.1 inch display.  Battery performance is simply awesome.  Camera is superb with high end image processing!  Charging speed is good even with a 20W charger.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I became first user of I phone. Let's start with the design. One of many things that  a lot of people, including me, love about Apple's  iPhones is the familiarity that they bring to the  table year-on-year while being ingenious enough to  make subtle changes in the design. Heavy HDR camera performance.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive']]
Worth for the money for those who like to enjoy a normal 6 inch mobile device. Awesome experience of having a new iPhone 13 in hand.  The picture clarity is good. Battery is 5/5 for me when compared other apple models. Make sure that we use the compatible adapter and do not overcharge to maintain the battery percentage in goodness level.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Excellent product. I always had a question why would someone want to invest 50k + on a mobile phone but now my views have changed.  Photos are just amazing its really hard to imagine how good the photos are even in the low light conditions  With A15 chip inside you-can throw any task at it and it will perform without any lag be games or your office work just so easy to work around and switch between multiple apps without getting them close.  Moving from Android to IPhone I do see some good and some bad experiences but yeah they’re different OS bound to have differences but loving it here.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Most valuable product. Got this for 66k and its worth enough to spend on premium products. The UI looks super clean and the body got metal on the sides and glass finish on the back. The quality of camera is good enough. No distortion in images and no noise. Its working on ios 16.1.2 , will get more further updates as apple claims for 5 years of giving frequent security as well as bug fixes updates.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive']]
Writing review after using 2 weeks its good phone , Camera was superb then any android phones , I am android users but after using iOS software I loved it, it was smooth and no lag at all after playing heavy games with high settings, A15 bionic chipset was really fast and battery efficient its last almost one day with heavy usage , Overall phone was very good in every perspective , thanks to the Flipkart for fastest delivery!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Apple as always surprises with the fluidity of the UI and the esthetics design, I'm upgrading from XS to 13 and I'm not regretting a bit, I mean dont get me wrong XS is a stunning phone after 3 odd years of time with it, never felt sluggish but iPhone 13 is a big jump and a game changer love the design, love the UI and the haptics of course very clean look and feel. I got this phone for 52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days, Thanks to flipkart the delivey was even more faster as expected. I will definitely come back after 3 months of usage with the review. donno about the battery life but definitely better than the XS.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['platform prices', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Just okay, nothing great really. More hype, less substance. Camera is downright disappointing. It’s great on the pro models, but not on this one. Low-light photography is good, but daylight photography is a disaster. Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom. My four-year old Samsung S9 plus produced far superior quality images than this. So I’m really disappointed with the cameras on this phone and repent having payed a fortune for the same. Avoid buying this phone if you are looking for good quality cameras, go for Samsung’s flagship S-series phones instead. This one is more of a show-off.####[['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Good phone Please Use Iphone 13 In Low Power Mode for Good Battery performance, Also Good Display 1 problem with display 60Hz refresh rate but iOS adjust this and give me best display performance smoother than Android Phone with 60Hz, My brother banged it against the wall but nothing happened except a crack on Display So Durability is Good Over All price this phone price little bit costly but phone is good, Ill give some camera samples in photos####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
1st time using an iPhone. Didn’t expect to blend in so easily. Though it is different from android, however the system is still easy to use and super responsive. Having said that, there are still few functions in android that makes it easy to use and coming from android having need to pay for everything also is a new experience####[['os usability', 'positive']]

It’s a perfect one. Build quality, camera (don’t need to say anything on it), iOS, everything is good. You don’t need an upgrade for next 4 to 5 years. So while upgrading androids every 1 or 2 years the amount we spent after 4 years will end up for one and half iPhone or two. So it’s worth the money.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]

It's beautiful and apple. but when i look back at my S22 Plus, this feels like a mediocre device from apple. i am not saying it's bad, but android is way ahead in terms of performance, battery, camera (yess, samsung camera is amazing) and connectivity.  It took me 30 minutes to connect and organize this iPhone to my car but android auto worked like magic and connects in less than 3 seconds. It's funny but this is real world data i am talking about. Then there are ads, i have system wide ad block installed on android and on iPhone u can't do that. Battery control is alot better on android again due to various software tweaks and it makes ur phone live for 2 days while iPhone is just barely 1 day. Okay enough of it. IPhone is best if you are iPhone fan. And let's leave android for productivity people.####[['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
After a very long time I switched back to the iPhone. Because I was using android devices since very long time, now I find it bit difficult work with it fluently. But, because iphone has the best online security, I again switched back to the Apple iPhone to use my official number in it, so I can keep my official data more secure and safe. Though, I am still using android phone as my secondary phone, because android is best for the entertainment purpose.####[['phone usability', 'positive']]

Outstanding phone, I have tried OnePlus , vivo, Samsung all the flagship phones, but why you need to invest in iPhone is for it’s reliable software and toughened hardware and their support and service quality the extra money is worthwhile if you are planning for long term use....only company close to its quality is OnePlus####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I cannot say more like the way Flipkart held this delivery. The contact people were in constant touch with me. Also when i selected open box delivery they delivery guy opened the box in front of me while recording video with his phone. What else a customer can think off. Also i don't think i can talk about endless benefits is the iphone. One work AMAZING!####[['platform general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I bought this mobile in may 2022, i wxchanged my old redmi not 7 pro for 8k, got this for 62k after that. So this my first ever flagship mobile and first i phone. So for a normal budget android user here are my reviews    Camera - just average, the pro models have better camera i guess, back camera is good and takes good pics, but front camera is too average, problem is android phones like redmi has too many gimmicks and it makes you look too attractive( which is fake) my wife likes redmi phone####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
There's nothing like an Apple iphone 13, go for it guys, better security, better camera better performance and even better look, videos and audios all are perfect, so many choices in the settings that you would love to know and I've changed from Android to iOS wow first time I feel like it's a good choice no android below 1 lakh will beat this best phone!!

It’s my first iPhone and I am very much eager to get it on hand. First impression ya it’s great phone by look.Good weight balance,great optimized chip ,and good battery back up.and now the things I am not impress with the price point is it’s display,ya it’s display is good but not up to the mark for the price.and camera samples not even comparable with Samsung A SERIES…I am also using Samsung A 52.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['display general', 'neutral']]
The iPhone 13 is a fantastic device. The camera system is top-notch, producing beautiful and detailed photos and videos. The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning-fast performance, making multitasking and gaming a breeze. The 5G capability is also a great addition, allowing for faster internet speeds and improved connectivity. The Ceramic Shield front cover provides better durability and drop protection. The battery life is also impressive, lasting throughout the day with moderate use. The only downside is the high price tag. Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone 13 to anyone in the market for a new phone.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Awesome phone with nice features.  Very handy and intelligent device. Camera is best. Cinematic mode is also very nice. Sound quality is also good.  Only one thing i dont like is the heating while charging but cool down immediately.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'neutral']]
I think its a very good product, and I feel is Android is good but an iPhone is just easy and after a certain stage in your life you want things to be easy and that’s exactly why I moved to iPhone the battery, display, OS and the camera is just something you would definitely love and enjoy.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
This is such a beast phone phone i ever had this is my first Apple phone but this... Is nice it's camera quality display performance is very nice I don't have a good experience of Apple phone's but ya when I use this I'll understand why they very expensive####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
I have been an android user all my life. Some things are more convenient in Android. Few things more convenient in ios. I had a Nord 2 5G. Better performance ( Of Course). Camera is really good. And the battery life is simply superb . Battery than any android i have ever seen or used.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
The migration from android to IOS is so painful.  First the phone: A solid one, boxy and feels good in hand. Excellent display, camera is good, battery …amazing. For some reason I see that my mobile signal is weak, this was not the case with my android phone.  Second the IOS: I didn’t find it amusing. From a customisation perspective it is probable 5 years behind android. There are certain simple things are missing, it’s a long list. But from a RAM and battery management, it is outstanding. From an user experience perspective, I am really struggling.    Best part is, I got it in sale for a good price after trading in my old phone.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['platform prices', 'positive']]
Superb Mobile  Amazing Purchase, It's really wow experience. No any premium Android ( even higher mga pixel) camera in comparison with iPhone camera. Last 12 years I was using only Android phone. Initially I am facing issue with operating system. But now it's feel very easy and best OS. Also phone having very good feature and security system.  Also thanks to Flipkart for good customer care service.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
I was skeptical when switching from android to IOS but now I love it. The phone feels good to hold in hand and the app interface is very smooth. Battery could be better but it does last a whole day on normal use so its adjustable. Overall great phone.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Everything is great . I have a pixel too. And i think pixel is 10% more better in photography. And iphone is 60% more better in videography. It works like a charm and battery is optimized greatly. Photo processing can be optimized a little more i think. Over all worth every money spent.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]
Super fantastic Apple iPhone...I repent not to have it earlier. It is a beast in the hand as a small digital device.

Got it at never expected price and finally upgraded to better Iphone after 5yrs. Very happy to receive genuine product.

I've been a hardcore Android user for almost 13 years since 2009 and switching Android to iphone after 13 years, ofcourse I'll miss out on a lot of features but also get a chance to add up with great splendor features, so ofcourse pro-models comes with more / a lot of features but they change every year they get discontinue every year I found that non-pro models more beneficial than pro-models atleast they don't discontinue in a year, so talk about iphone 13 it's super sexy hot color starlight, with classic design, performance top notch, battery backup is good, with great features to improve its health, I'm deeply passionate in love with this iphone i suggest you and highly highly highly recommended Atleast one a while every Citizen to try this type of Iphone highly recommend####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Picture quality is amazing you do not need to think twice about buying this for performance and photos, just go for it. Bionic A 15 is super fast and it has amazing performance,  It is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user,  But if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
Fantastic,useful, excellent,protective,fine camera,good storage if you want all these demands in one phone fulfilled go for iphone 13 these are very good if you are a regular phone user excellent if you want gaming smoothness and little fps too then go for 13 or 14 pro as a new and first iphone user i am comfortable in all aspects and last one I love apple iphone 13####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive']]
Phone is good. But within a week of use with proper protection cover, I saw paint of silent button chipped off. Its very bad thing to see in apple iphone.

Everything was well and good expect for the delivery boy, I mean what can I say, everybody needs to check the every detail of their new i phone that they bought, but for some reason this guy was in a hurry like he is about to catch a train after this and make the whole process unenjoyable!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['shipping delivery', 'negative']]
It works really well More than anything I enjoy flaunting my three eyed phone and Apple  Logo ! Of course it’s a costly phone and I won’t justify its price tag .

OMG,13 Max Pro is a ultimate bundle of smart phone Camera is like DSLR and the phone performance is absolutely fine ya it’s very expensive 1 but if you want something different with better perform you should grab it.  Battery backup is good I charge it once in 1.5 days so it is good for me.

Great phone from Apple. Excellent display with variable refresh rate. Feels very light on hand. Great battery stand by time. Amazing delivery speed by Flipkart.

Been using this phone for last 2 months. This is my first iphone. I’ve just switched from android. This phone is expensive but kinda worth it. In love with this phone, the camera which I don’t need to say anything about.  I hope it will last more than 3 years.  every feature is awesome. The touch quality too love it####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive']]
all things are good but it has 2 major issues, it heats up when you do a little bit gaming and it has serious network issues and wifi issues then android. network and wifi connections are much better on android. all other things are best####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
I've never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max. I finally pulled the trigger and got it.    Now coming to the phone, it's nothing short of amazing. It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it. If you're sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart, don't be. It's a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neat    The only downside I see to this phone is the storage. I got the 128 GB model and feel that it is waaay to low if you use the cameras regularly.    Overall very satisfied with the purchase.####[['storage general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Fantastic product even though it's just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro. The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it's beautiful. Dynamic island is very practical and useful. Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it.    Flipkart's delivery was quick and hassle free. The order was delivered on the launch date and was packed well.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Earlier I had plan to go with S23+ but buying a iphone is a personal preference, i have gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I/we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android. I would rate s23+ 10/10 and even iphone 14 pro 10/10 as the only difference i could see is the os.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
It's my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation I love the color, I love the accessibility of the phone....I need to learn more about its functionality, but as far as I have seen, it's quite easy and it has a lot of functions to work on, specially if you are a content writer or a blogger you get a lot of content creation platforms and they are really amazing.    This phone not only for good quality photography but a lot of other task too.####[['phone design_features', 'negative']]
I was using Iphone 6s and also Oneplus 6t. Both mobiles were perfectly alright in Photos, gaming, and smooth interface . My 6s mobile getting battery issue. thought upgrade to 11.

iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.  If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.  Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Amazing camera quality as expected, battery also has very good performance. Display, body, and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had. Sound quality of speakers is more than sufficient. Apple is known for it’s customer friendly security services and I can see it how. The A13 processor is the best in its work. So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it, just go for it without delay.    The most amazing thing it the delivery. Flipkart has delivered it in the span of 17hrs.  Thank you for this mind boggling product both Apple and Flipkart.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['shipping delivery', 'positive']]

It’s been 7 years I was waiting for an income for my first iPhone .it was like a dream to me and finally I achieved it. Why chose iPhone?? It’s a premium standard level phone maybe you could find other brands value like this but not all those are iPhone. If you are thinking to buy an iPhone don’t think too much grab it bro. Being an an iPhone owner can give you a feeling like owning an Lamborghini in your pocket According to me a middle class family boy.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Excellent camera, good performance, no lag. The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger . Finally I am an android user, it was my first apple phone, I promise u guys the iOS is so smooth.. overall the phone is damn good.... close eyes to buy it.. thanks to Flipkart to deliver this amazing genuine product on time.. at last the iPhone 11 make me smile####[['display general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand.

Very prompt service and fast delivery.####[['os usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['camera design_features', 'neutral']]
It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g  Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge  Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
No need to buy this mobile at this cost, there is no finger scanner and even pattern lock is not available in this,  This mobile is not even useful for old people.

I have received this product on 18th March, thanks to Flipkart that he product was received very fast. This is the genuine review of the phone which I have felt on my side. The product is overall good enough. The camera I feel little bad, in the day light its ok ..and even in the night we can take the photos but when the light is not good enough the photos are not good. The battery wise is ok i am changing 2 times in a day(not fully dropped). I am using the phone by data connection full time on. The video quality is not upto the mark. I think they will look into that in future updates. Performance wise and display wise no words to say its excellent. So please look into the camera performance and the battery side this is the only request from my side. Thank you moto for giving a best stock Android experience.####[['platform general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
The phone is excellent, very smooth and easy to run. Camera has massively improved as per Motorola standards but the. LCD display, used in sunlight to see, it is not bad but not something that will make you happy. Average is the word. I do not play games so no comments. I played music, the sound is crisp and very pleasant. Phone calls are good. 5G works very well. There is a very good option to protect 5g from draining your data, phone puts you on 4g. Bloatware has started off, it is not the kind the earlier generation of Moto g. But manageable unlike Realme, Redmi etc. Android 13 is great. Sadly you will get just one update.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]

Not a good product . I bought it as it was advertised for 2 micrometer camera which just turned out to be a hype. Camera is just average.    This phone does not support 5g at the moment . Not sure when company is releasing update to support 5g.    Better to go for poco x4 pro which is at same price banfld with amoled panel and is 5 g ready    Motorola has released a half baked product which does not seem to justify the price .####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Product is awesome in this price range.  Camera performance is good because of its ultra pixel technology and ultrawide lens is too good in this price range as it work as macro and depth sensor which gives more details and no other brand is providing ultrawide lens in this range.  Type C To C charger is provided in the box which is good  Processor is also good as it provide smooth experience in gaming and also It has 120hz refresh rate which is dynamic .  Cons battery backup is less if we compared to other phones but its satisfactory.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
This phone is just lit . Good Looking design. Looks like premium. Night photos are phenomenal . Stock Android with a powerful processor under 20000. The battery is also great. In comparison to iqoo z7, it has a drop notch design which looks outdated.

If you want haptics then it's not for you poor vibration  Battery is nice but charging is slow.

I've been using the Moto G73 5G for a while now, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its performance. The phone has a large 6.5-inch screen with a high refresh rate that makes scrolling through apps and websites smooth and seamless. The 5G connectivity is also a big plus, as I can easily stream videos, make video calls, and download large files without any lag.  The phone's battery life is impressive, lasting me through a full day of moderate to heavy usage. I also appreciate the phone's fast charging capabilities, which allow me to top up the battery quickly when needed.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
At first thanks to Flipkart for delivery in 1day. Performance of this phone is very good and smooth. I feel it's really 120z. No Network issues in my Village always show 4G+ signal. Clean UI and stock Android. Secure folder is available. One thing that I miss i.e theme because you can't customise your phone with various types of themes and wallpaper. You only use system wallpaper and theme.  There is no available gallery, file management, Music player apps like other brand phones. All apps are working with Google products. Video quality is good HDR supported.####[['shipping delivery', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'neutral'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]

The review I am writing after 10 days of usage. The initial impression is really good. The display is crystal clear and is soft on eyes. Functioning of phone is very smooth.  I am yet to explore the phone fully but the basic usage has satisfied me a lot and some very useful features of phone, like karate chop switching on of torch light, twist and open the camera are very handy. 10 days of use is quite less to write an extensive review but it gives an idea of the quality of product to an extent.  Overall seems to me a good buy and value for money. I prefer separate slot for SDCard and as this phone has a hybrid slot for sim cards and SDCard so I have to adjust with this shortcoming for my preference.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
Good phone for stock android lovers. camera is also descent (use GCAM for better results). Amoled screen is missing, still screen is good. HAS TRUE DUAL 5G SUPPORT (both sim work 5g at same time) this is new and first time feature due to Dimensity 930 processor. I like moto phones.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
good product from Motorola. I've been using this product for more than 3 weeks now and I'm quite satisfied with it's performance. They have really improved camera this time, pictures are just great. The phone works quite smoothly with it's 120Hz display. But, phone get slightly heated even with little usage; also battery backup is okay, it's not that great####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'neutral']]
I have previously samsung s9plus n their night mode is super and i'm surprised moto g73 night mode is also work so close too .. And super fine picture clicked in night camera performance of g73 is perfectly none other brand phone under 20k can beat  Overall just go for without any hazitation.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Really surprised me.. 8 to 100% charge within 1 hour only and battery backup is so awesome. 2 days life. Camera is also best in the class. Played COD and Asphalt 9 for more than 3 hours no heating or battery fast draining problem. Most important feature is Dolby Atmos working perfectly. If you are a music lover best choice for you. connect the Dolby Atmos supported earbuds and it will surprise you with a great music experience. Really a value for money product. Heavily recommended if you have a budget of 18k.####[['battery charging', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Besides camera everything is good.  If you are camera person and don't have any use then don't buy.  I'f you want great game experience, display quality and performance then must buy.  Battery back up over wifi and cellular network is good almost 24hr and everything works fine if your are minimal user like me. Motorola always offer good quality at there price points.  Best in mid range phone.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]
i have always been using multiple brands of mobiles so i would say this is one of the best mobile under 19K I really like the design and practicality elements like side mounted finger print scanner, dual speaker, moto family space, premium back case etc Camera is pretty good but only if you know how to use it properly.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
I regret it so so much. This doesn't even have a decent camera. The selfie camera has a bluish tint. the battery last for about 6-7 hour for an avg user.  I'm writting this review after 15 days maybe as i bought it on the day it got launch. Go for realme 9 pro or oneplus ce2nord lite.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]
I ordered Moto G73 on 16th March which was delivered to me on 18th March. I would like to share that its battery life is really pathetic. Even if the phone is not in use, the battery drains very fast. It has happened a couple of times now that the battery was at around 55% at 11 pm (when I put the phone on DND). When I checked the phone the next day at 7 am, the phone was off! The battery drains very fast even at DND mode.####[['battery general', 'negative']]
he battery back is very very very poor because I am changing in a day 3 times this is very bad do not buy this a very bad because the mobile phone  is nothing without battery this very poor. i am not recommended to buy any person.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I recently purchased this device(Motorola g73 5G), and I'm extremely disappointed with its performance. Despite being in areas with strong network signals, the device is not sensing the network and is unable to connect to the internet or make calls. This is a major inconvenience and makes the device practically useless. I would not recommend this product to anyone who needs reliable network connectivity on their mobile device. 5G is not supporting. Total waste product.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
After using almost 20 days I am writing my review.  Mobile is heavy heating even when we calling also after using 5 mins it is getting heated.  Only positive thing is changing within 1 hour it is getting changed.  Otherthan this nothing better.  My suggestion is please don't buy this product####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Moto disappointed with this device, battery drains like anything, this is the core requirement for me but what I can do.  I have seen many reviews regarding battery issues, but didn't consider, TRUSTED THE BRAND.  Display is good, CPU consumes more battery while doing some sort of heavy operations like app install, update install.  Dimensity 930 need some more optimisation, moto should fix this battery issues ASAP.  Camera is below average.  Better to look some other alternatives in this price range.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
Totally money waste mobile. Doesn't worth the money. Camera quality is not good even sometime mobile lags. I applied for return but they rejected . Never trust Motorola and Flipkart.

This is my first moto phone that I'm using since a week and observe. Performance is good no doubt but somehow annoyed by battery performance and camera quality. It could be optimized and I hope will fix the draining issue soon####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
Display and camera are the only cons i felt. Everything else is justified for the price. I should have purchased the moto g82 because of the oled display. Cameras i felt are the same, not seeing any improvement over the G82. Both are mediocre.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'neutral']]
Moto g73 is an over priced mid range phone with a lot of cellular call connectivity issues and call drops/ call reception issues. Coming to sound Speaker on full volume settings vibrates on the back of the phone.Volume settings Speaker on below 80% is not audible. Screen quality is not up to the pricing mark of the phone.Finger print goes non responsive randomly.  Apart from clean Android UI experience nothing is fine.  A big No!

Worst product from Lenovo.    After use of one month most of Android app lacking not proper response.  Every time you had to uninstall or force stop to app for use purpose.

Not met the expectations of what Motorola promised. Performance is something I was looking for and this phone just did not meet the expectations. Hangs up a lot while multitasking. I'm not a gamer, basic smartphone user. A lot of parties complained about voice congestion and loss of clarity while talking. Looks like the mic is not up to the mark. Overall it's okay to use a smartphone and not worth the money spent.####[['company general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
After 3 days problem started. Screen becomes dark. Nothing worked. Showed system UI not responding.

Phone could have been better but it is still pretty good. No lag. Camera is okay. Other phones offer better camera. But great battery backup and I love some other features of this phone.

Good looking phone. Fast with 5000 MAH battery. Camera is also good. Just one issue that I'd doesn't charge as fast as it says. With 65 watt charger it takes around an hour to charge.

The video quality is very poor. You can apply only up to 1080p60. Camera quality is below average from my point of view.

Haven't got any complaints overall, good built quality, display is vibrant enough and bright, battery life is on the better side, lasts a while. It can feel a bit slow and take some time to load apps up but that's to be expected with a 2 GB RAM The camera could've been better, it takes great vibrant photos but bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details. Not very fond of the audio unit, music sounds way harsh without any bass or the finer sounds.####[['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative']]
I got it for 6.5k and at that price point it's Recommended. I have used it for More than 6 months now.

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory quality', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Bought it for ₹6799. Still working proper after 2 years. Battery life on normal usage is about 1-1½ days, if used only for making calls then about 5-6 days.

I bought this phone for my mom. She's been using this phone since an year. I always buy redmi because they've gained my trust. My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime. They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust, but shockingly, the phone was utter disappointment. My mom is a very light user. She only uses phone for calling and youtube. But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks. It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera. I resetted the phone, updated software, everything but of no use. Never expected this from a trustful brand like redmi. I suggest you guys to take little more priced phones from redmi, entry level phones are poor in performance.

This phone has lots of issues first of all it has weird issues. It suddenly gives warning of pressing button and it has no meaning it hangs many times. I must say worst quality phone. Don't purchase it. Battery drains very fast. Sound of phone is too low####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]

The battery backup is amazing. The display is great, and 120 hz is working in almost all places. UI and app opening is butter smooth. Optiomization of the software seems good. Cameras are really nice for Chinese phones. Haptics are or a good quality although a little weak. Call quality is as expected. Overall, it is a great bargain at 25k.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Everything seems to be working fine. The camera is okayish. No heating issue, the temperature during charging stays below 40c. 5g is working as expected in my area which is quite a bit away from main city,the max speed i got is 550mbps, for some reason charging animation does not work but that's not an issue for me. Great performance. The display is above average from my pov.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
MORE BETTER EXPERIENCE THAN EXPECTED, NO WORDS THE BEST PHONE IN THE SEGMENT. IT COSTED ME AROUND 23,0000 AND IT'S THE FLAGSHIP UNDER 25K. NO WORDS JUST GO FOR IT, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Everything about this phone is really good. Processor, camera, software, battery life, updates. Only little grope I have is battery life. It's great but not excellent like z6 series. But the additional benefits of this phone over z series is worth it for giving up on excellent battery life.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
