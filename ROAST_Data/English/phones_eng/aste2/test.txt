Mobile is very handy . Packed with good performances and nice camera . This is my first iPhone . Very good experience with Apple . Battery is worst . I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time .

Apple as always surprises with the fluidity of the UI and the esthetics design , I ' m upgrading from XS to 13 and I ' m not regretting a bit , I mean dont get me wrong XS is a stunning phone after 3 odd years of time with it , never felt sluggish but iPhone 13 is a big jump and a game changer love the design , love the UI and the haptics of course very clean look and feel . I got this phone for 52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days , Thanks to flipkart the delivey was even more faster as expected .

It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it , the camera is a beast , the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use , if ur a heavy user you ' d need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get really good game play , worth the money , between if ur coming for a larger screen , you might feel it ' s a lil too small but honestly it ' s not really that small , so buy it , it ' s perfect .####[([14], [17], 'POS'), ([20], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'NEU'), ([20], [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 'NEU'), ([69], [86, 87, 88, 89], 'NEU')]

It’s a perfect one . Build quality , camera ( don’t need to say anything on it ) , iOS , everything is good . You don’t need an upgrade for next 4 to 5 years .

Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it . It’s super fast , has an awesome pair of camera , punchy speaker , good looks , beautiful screen , perfect size and an amazing user experience . Everything about this phone is no nonsense . Coming to battery , I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage , it easily lasts 24 hours . It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that , you know you have got a bad habit to put off .####[([96], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([26], [23], 'POS'), ([96], [31, 32], 'POS'), ([35], [34], 'POS'), ([96], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([96], [41, 42, 43], 'POS'), ([55], [62], 'NEG')]
This is my first iPhone . I would say that coming from Android , there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it . Coming to the phone itself , camera is amazing minus the low light photography part . Battery backup is ok ok . I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low . Also since I am mostly at home , it doesn’t matter so much . Display is ok . Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse . But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand . Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run . It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game , battery will tale a hit .####[([42], [44, 45, 46, 47, 48], 'POS'), ([52, 53], [55, 56], 'NEU'), ([75], [77], 'NEG'), ([93], [95], 'POS'), ([93], [103, 104], 'NEG'), ([93], [107, 108, 109], 'NEG'), ([93], [115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123], 'POS'), ([4], [134, 135, 136, 137], 'POS'), ([4], [145, 146], 'POS'), ([4], [154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162], 'NEG')]

In terms of battery life , the Vivo T2 5G has a 4500mAh battery that supports 44W fast charging . According to reviews , the battery life is decent , and the fast charging is convenient for when you need to top up the battery quickly .

The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s . The battery life is longer . And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro ( even on a non - Pro phone ) . Yes , the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land . But it’s more about what this chip lets you do . This includes Cinematic mode , which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus , and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics .####[([3], [5], 'POS'), ([11, 12], [14], 'POS'), ([23], [22], 'POS'), ([23], [25, 26], 'POS'), ([23], [28, 29, 30], 'POS'), ([51, 52], [61, 62, 63, 64, 65], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'POS'), ([23], [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105], 'POS')]

Worth for the money for those who like to enjoy a normal 6 inch mobile device . Awesome experience of having a new iPhone 13 in hand . The picture clarity is good . Battery is 5 / 5 for me when compared other apple models .

I have received this product on 18th March , thanks to Flipkart that he product was received very fast . This is the genuine review of the phone which I have felt on my side . The product is overall good enough . The camera I feel little bad , in the day light its ok . . and even in the night we can take the photos but when the light is not good enough the photos are not good . The battery wise is ok i am changing 2 times in a day ( not fully dropped ) . I am using the phone by data connection full time on . The video quality is not upto the mark . I think they will look into that in future updates . Performance wise and display wise no words to say its excellent . So please look into the camera performance and the battery side this is the only request from my side . Thank you moto for giving a best stock Android experience .####[([11], [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 'POS'), ([27], [39, 40], 'POS'), ([44], [47, 48], 'NEG'), ([44], [52, 53, 54, 55], 'NEU'), ([44], [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80], 'NEG'), ([83], [86], 'NEU'), ([44], [114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120], 'NEG'), ([133], [143], 'POS'), ([136], [143], 'POS')]
I bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues . So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand . It has been a few days since I have been using this phone . I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good . The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate . The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah . Charging is quite fast . The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well .####[([46], [48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([54], [55, 56, 57], 'POS'), ([60], [62], 'POS'), ([70], [72], 'POS'), ([70], [86, 87, 88, 89], 'POS'), ([92], [94], 'POS'), ([92], [96, 97, 98, 99, 100], 'POS')]

I Have been using this phone from 15 days . Dint find any issue yet .

The iPhone 13 is a fantastic device . The camera system is top - notch , producing beautiful and detailed photos and videos . The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning - fast performance , making multitasking and gaming a breeze . The 5G capability is also a great addition , allowing for faster internet speeds and improved connectivity . The Ceramic Shield front cover provides better durability and drop protection . The battery life is also impressive , lasting throughout the day with moderate use . The only downside is the high price tag . Overall , I highly recommend the iPhone 13 to anyone in the market for a new phone .####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([25, 26, 27], [29, 30, 31, 32], 'POS'), ([42], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([42], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [65, 66], 'POS'), ([60, 61], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [76], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'NEU'), ([1, 2], [91, 92], 'NEG'), ([1, 2], [98, 99], 'POS')]
I got this phone yesterday and have spent most of my time exploring it . Its a superb phone and except for Battery backup I dont think there is any flaw . You buy cellphones to show off a little , with good specs , smooth operating systen , camera . . it ticks each and every box with flying colors . Icing on the cake ? The on sale price ! Go for it without any thought if your budget allows . I am very happy with it .####[([18], [17], 'POS'), ([22, 23], [20], 'NEG'), ([18], [42, 43], 'POS'), ([46, 47], [45], 'POS'), ([49], [45], 'POS'), ([18], [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'POS')]

If your budget is 7000 then believe me this is the best choice , I ' m writing this review after one month use . over all performance is good . No lag during free fire at smooth graphics , No fingerprint sensor but its okey bcoz they already provided many features . 5000 mAh battery is amazing . it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use . and one day at highest use . I played free fire for 30 min and Amazing thing that battery used is only 5 % . this a the real value for money phone , full paisa wasul phone . also supports VoLTE calling and WiFi . big screen .####[([118], [40, 41, 42], 'NEG'), ([53, 54, 55], [57], 'POS'), ([53, 54, 55], [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69], 'POS'), ([53, 54, 55], [72, 73, 74, 75, 76], 'POS'), ([118], [117], 'POS'), ([118], [37, 38], 'POS')]

1st time using an iPhone . Didn’t expect to blend in so easily . Though it is different from android , however the system is still easy to use and super responsive .

Picture quality is amazing you do not need to think twice about buying this for performance and photos , just go for it .

I think this is one of the best phone in market at this price range . . . . . decent camera , great charging speed , resilient and premium look , flagship processor .

One of the best handsets , very easy to carry & handle . Exceptional performance & amazing display , however battery is the only concern . It consumes more battery when you use internet , especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures . Otherwise everything thing is perfect .

I ' m using vivo mobile since last 8 years but this time vivo didn ' t gave their best in this smartphone .####[([12], [8, 9, 10, 11], 'NEG'), ([12], [17, 18], 'NEG'), ([12], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([12], [32, 33, 34], 'NEG'), ([47], [44, 45], 'NEG'), ([47], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'NEG')]
Superb Mobile Amazing Purchase , It ' s really wow experience . No any premium Android ( even higher mga pixel ) camera in comparison with iPhone camera . Last 12 years I was using only Android phone . Initially I am facing issue with operating system . But now it ' s feel very easy and best OS . Also phone having very good feature and security system . Also thanks to Flipkart for good customer care service .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([1], [9, 10], 'POS'), ([58], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([58], [57], 'POS'), ([65], [63, 64], 'POS'), ([67, 68], [63, 64], 'POS'), ([73], [75, 76, 77, 78], 'POS')]

This phone has over 100 megapixel camera 6x zoom and 5000 mah battery but it doesn ' t feel like a OnePlus phone . I used OnePlus Nord for 3 years but the phone never lagged or got stuck even once . This phone started to lag on the 2nd day itself . Not a good buy . Screen , display , battery and sound are good but the processor kills the vibe .####[([6], [3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([6], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([12], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([1], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 'NEG'), ([1], [53, 54, 55, 56], 'NEG'), ([1], [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], 'NEG'), ([69], [70, 71, 72], 'NEG'), ([60], [58], 'POS'), ([62], [66], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS')]
If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed . Performance wise this phone is ultra first . Camera is also pretty good , attached images were taken indoor only . Display is also quite good . The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size . So easy to use this phone singe handedly . Excellent grip . Fits very crisply in pockets . The worst thing is it’s battery . Doesn’t last long . Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off .####[([24], [27, 28], 'POS'), ([37], [40, 41], 'POS'), ([51], [44, 45], 'POS'), ([48], [54, 55, 56], 'POS'), ([48], [62, 63], 'POS'), ([48], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69], 'POS'), ([76], [72], 'NEG'), ([76], [78, 79, 80], 'NEG'), ([16], [21, 22], 'POS')]
Bought this phone during launch day . Display is excellent . Charging speed is good . Camera is good . Photo quality is good in good light conditions . Low light shoots are good in night mode .

I ordered Moto G73 on 16th March which was delivered to me on 18th March . I would like to share that its battery life is really pathetic . Even if the phone is not in use , the battery drains very fast . It has happened a couple of times now that the battery was at around 55 % at 11 pm ( when I put the phone on DND ) . When I checked the phone the next day at 7 am , the phone was off ! The battery drains very fast even at DND mode .####[([23, 24], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([39], [40, 41, 42], 'NEG'), ([39], [92, 93, 94], 'NEG')]
The battery is draining very fast , it has 5000 mah battery but it is working like a old 1000 mah one . Connectivity is poor and the microphone is also not working properly .

Overall wonderful mobile . But it heats up a little during normal operation . Battery backup is very good . Camera is not upto the mark as per price standard . Pictures looks like we have shoot with mid range camera phones . Pixel tends to break a lot with normal zoom which actually occurs with mid range camera mobiles . So I would rate camera 2 / 5 . . . . and other than camera 5 / 5 . Sound was really great . Loud and crispy .####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([2], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [17, 18], 'POS'), ([20], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], 'NEG'), ([20], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], 'NEG'), ([20], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'NEG'), ([81], [83, 84], 'POS'), ([81], [88], 'POS'), ([81], [86], 'POS')]
This Smartphone is just beast , I am switching to Samsung phone after long time after note 5 . Design is really awesome and it ' s very comfortable to hold . A bit heavier side it is expected as title says beast . Display best in the market first point which interest me in this phone . Second point which I liked about of this phone is the excellent Battery life even having so huge and beautiful Display it is giving 8 - 9 hrs screen on time which is again amazing .

I am simply saying not to go with this phone it is not good even not volte leave 5 g aside every description is only in words nothing is visible on phone .

At first hands - on , looks like a pretty solid phone considering the form factor . The obvious tradeoff is the battery life , I ' m getting around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi always on and no sim card . Apart from that the only other issue I feel is that the hinge and folding mechanism is slightly weaker than the Flip 4 as I have used the Flip 4 in Samsung cafe stores and they seem tougher than the Flip 3 .####[([22, 23], [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 'NEG'), ([11], [64, 65, 66, 67, 68], 'NEG')]
I ' ve had a fantastic experience with Motog73 so far . I could not imagine these many features in a phone ( particularly in this price range ) , and the camera really steals the show with its 2micron 50MP imaging system . This phone produces visually captivating , lively , colorful , and stunning images straight out of the box so I won ' t have to spend time making a lot of changes . The night light also captures incredible pictures without any blurring areas . When it comes to taking pictures , it comfortably beats my friend ' s oneplus phone which is famous for its camera . The colors are very vibrant and eye - catching . and the display is legible even in bright sunlight . Playing games and watching movies is another enjoyable experience on g73 . In terms of daily performance also , the phone is quick and smooth . I ' ve been using it for over a week now and the experience has been wonderful !####[([8], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([32], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 'POS'), ([32], [46, 47, 48], 'POS'), ([32], [50], 'POS'), ([32], [52], 'POS'), ([32], [55, 56], 'POS'), ([32], [78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83], 'POS'), ([32], [84, 85, 86, 87], 'POS'), ([124], [113, 114, 115, 116], 'POS'), ([124], [118, 119, 120], 'POS'), ([124], [126, 127, 128, 129, 130], 'POS'), ([124], [139, 140], 'POS'), ([148], [154], 'POS'), ([148], [156], 'POS'), ([8], [171, 172, 173, 174], 'POS')]

Not a good product . I bought it as it was advertised for 2 micrometer camera which just turned out to be a hype . Camera is just average . This phone does not support 5g at the moment . Not sure when company is releasing update to support 5g . Better to go for poco x4 pro which is at same price banfld with amoled panel and is 5 g ready Motorola has released a half baked product which does not seem to justify the price .####[([31], [0, 1, 2], 'NEG'), ([25], [28], 'NEU'), ([31], [32, 33, 34, 35], 'NEG'), ([31], [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86], 'NEG')]

The battery backup is amazing . The display is great , and 120 hz is working in almost all places . UI and app opening is butter smooth . Optiomization of the software seems good .

Nice product and it ' s camera is just amazing but slightly disappointed about it ' s processor in this price range there are mobiles which have mediatek 1300 chipset is also available , it is good for who don ' t go for intermediate gaming , but it ' s color changing effect is awesome . Those guys who love photography can go for this device . In this price range the processor is not up to the mark , should have mediatek dimesity 1300 instead of 900 .####[([24], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([6], [9], 'POS'), ([17], [12], 'NEG'), ([24], [51, 52, 53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([6], [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], 'POS'), ([17], [75, 76, 77, 78, 79], 'NEG')]

Good phone for stock android lovers . camera is also descent ( use GCAM for better results ) . Amoled screen is missing , still screen is good .

Moto disappointed with this device , battery drains like anything , this is the core requirement for me but what I can do .

Now coming to the phone , it ' s nothing short of amazing . It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it . If you ' re sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart , don ' t be . It ' s a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neat The only downside I see to this phone is the storage . I got the 128 GB model and feel that it is waaay to low if you use the cameras regularly . Overall very satisfied with the purchase .####[([118], [110], 'NEG'), ([138], [127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133], 'NEG'), ([22, 23, 24], [142, 143, 144, 145, 146], 'POS')]

I jumped from old SE to the new SE . the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm . The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design .

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE . It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user ' s finger doesn ' t slide smoothly . The software is very very poor . It doesn ' t have basic facilities like scheduled power on / off . The camera focusing and software is poor . The phone doesn ' t allow user to do even basic settings like adjusting touch sensitivity . The user has to try multiple times to slide down the notification panel . These drawbacks are not due to any physical defects but due to very poor software and hardware design . The user can do only a few settings compared to other phones . I did not want to buy a Chinese phone so I purchased this but now I have come to know that Redmi 6A is cheaper and far far better than this phone both software and hardware wise .####[([4], [0, 1, 2], 'POS'), ([4], [8, 9], 'NEG'), ([11], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG'), ([27], [29, 30, 31], 'NEG'), ([27], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'NEG'), ([27], [53], 'NEG'), ([48, 49], [53], 'NEG'), ([27], [98, 99], 'NEG'), ([27], [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'NEG'), ([27], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'NEG'), ([102, 103], [98, 99], 'NEG')]

I bought this phone for my mom . She ' s been using this phone since an year . I always buy redmi because they ' ve gained my trust . My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime . They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust , but shockingly , the phone was utter disappointment . My mom is a very light user . She only uses phone for calling and youtube . But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks . It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera . I resetted the phone , updated software , everything but of no use . Never expected this from a trustful brand like redmi . I suggest you guys to take little more priced phones from redmi , entry level phones are poor in performance .

Let ' s face it . The main reason you ' re even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn ' t compromise on power . Getting OS updates for another 4 - 5 years , with a decent camera , waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage . There ' s a few things it could ' ve done better : 1 . Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage . 2 . The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio . 3 . Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement . 4 .

I played music , the sound is crisp and very pleasant . Phone calls are good . 5G works very well . There is a very good option to protect 5g from draining your data , phone puts you on 4g . Bloatware has started off , it is not the kind the earlier generation of Moto g . But manageable unlike Realme , Redmi etc . Android 13 is great . Sadly you will get just one update .####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([1], [8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([12], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([24], [45], 'NEU'), ([64], [66], 'POS'), ([64], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([1], [72, 73, 74], 'POS'), ([1], [76, 77, 78, 79], 'POS'), ([1], [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93], 'POS'), ([101], [103, 104], 'POS')]
Over all good phone But the Camera quality in a low light is not that good . Overall display colour contrast is decent . Battery performance is good you can rock with 60 % charge overall day . Basel is so thick in comparison of the other phone in to this price range . Phone is slightly heavy in weight . Its come with samsung ui 5 . 0 and Android 13 and Exynos support so no problem in the daily use .####[([3], [2], 'POS'), ([6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 'NEG'), ([18], [19, 20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([24], [25, 26, 27], 'POS'), ([18], [38, 39, 40, 41], 'NEG'), ([3], [56, 57, 58, 59], 'NEG'), ([64, 65, 66, 67, 68], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'POS'), ([73], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'POS')]
