The phone is overall good . Few things i noted in first 3 days of use : 1 ) battery lasts for an entire day with medium usage . 2 ) speaker output is good and loud . 3 ) still have vivo apps such as - v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled . This should be removed from flagships atleast . 4 ) display is awsome , but LTPO would have been better given the price . 5 ) havent tried heavy gaming , but processor seems capable . 6 ) camera performance is good , but in my old phone i have been using GCAM , so compared to that the stock camera smoothens skin in portrait mode , which i am not a big fan of . 7 ) getting a weird bug , i have JBL Flip 6 , and when its connected , Absolute volume control is not available for some reason . This might be a software bug , but needs to be fixed .####[([1], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([19], [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], 'POS'), ([31], [36], 'POS'), ([31], [32, 33, 34], 'POS'), ([43], [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'NEG'), ([69], [71], 'POS'), ([91], [92, 93], 'POS'), ([97], [98, 99, 100], 'POS'), ([167, 168], [139, 140], 'NEG'), ([167, 168], [153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158], 'NEG')]

In terms of battery life , the Vivo T2 5G has a 4500mAh battery that supports 44W fast charging . According to reviews , the battery life is decent , and the fast charging is convenient for when you need to top up the battery quickly .

This is not just a phone but a piece of Art . Using this phone is an experience in itself , something ' s which elevates the experience are 1 . Wonderfull screen : The highlight of this phone , a curved display is a delight to use in every possible aspect , paired with fast refresh rate which adds to the overall awesome experience . 2 . Very capable processor : Dimensity 7200 does it ' s work and the phone feels pretty slick and quick to everyday usage , yet to see any lags , i don ' t play games so no idea how it fares in that department . 3 . Audio : although v27 has single speaker system , the sound quality is top notch and gives a great audio experience , though it ' s not very loud but the quality is there . 4 . Camera : Well , it ' s the highlight of this phone and you really need to use the camera to feel it , it takes wonderful photos in every situation , the ring light is not a gimmick and truly is a gamechanger .####[([5], [8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS'), ([41, 42], [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([41, 42], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [68, 69, 70], 'POS'), ([72, 73], [91, 92, 93, 94, 95], 'POS'), ([5], [82, 83, 84], 'POS'), ([5], [86, 87, 88, 89], 'POS'), ([120, 121, 122], [125, 126, 127, 128, 129], 'POS'), ([120, 121, 122], [133, 134, 135], 'POS'), ([120, 121, 122], [141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148], 'POS'), ([152], [177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182], 'POS'), ([152], [185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190], 'POS'), ([152], [192, 193, 194, 195], 'POS')]

It ' s beautiful and apple . but when i look back at my S22 Plus , this feels like a mediocre device from apple . i am not saying it ' s bad , but android is way ahead in terms of performance , battery , camera ( yess , samsung camera is amazing ) and connectivity . It took me 30 minutes to connect and organize this iPhone to my car but android auto worked like magic and connects in less than 3 seconds .

The performance iss as expected great , the battery life is not actually a concern , but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww . Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager , with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20 % left and you could get near to 80 , . Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming , 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season . Camera is good enough for the price don ' t expect flagship level performance , as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me . Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros , Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features , And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .

My first Vivo phone and surely my last one . The display , though AMOLED , comes nowhere near SAMSUNG sAMOLED . The design is prehistoric , especially with the back dated thick bezels .

Just okay , nothing great really . More hype , less substance . Camera is downright disappointing . It’s great on the pro models , but not on this one .

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given .

Fantastic mobile in all means . This is the best Android in market without doubt and I feel this is far better than latest iPhone in terms of quality and features . Noted my observations after 2 weeks of usage . But think twice before buying this from Flipkart . Such a pathetic service . I bought this phone in exchange of my S20 Fe 5g . My mobile was in flawless condition and the exchange amount was 22k . But during inspection they told it has a scratch on side and 3k will be deducted . It was just a very minor line on the side and because of that they deducted 3000Rs . Absolutely ridiculous .

Most valuable product . Got this for 66k and its worth enough to spend on premium products . The UI looks super clean and the body got metal on the sides and glass finish on the back . The quality of camera is good enough . No distortion in images and no noise . Its working on ios 16 . 1 . 2 , will get more further updates as apple claims for 5 years of giving frequent security as well as bug fixes updates .####[([19], [20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([41], [43, 44], 'POS'), ([41], [46, 47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([41], [51, 52], 'POS'), ([70], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'POS')]
i have always been using multiple brands of mobiles so i would say this is one of the best mobile under 19K I really like the design and practicality elements like side mounted finger print scanner , dual speaker , moto family space , premium back case etc Camera is pretty good but only if you know how to use it properly .####[([19], [18], 'POS'), ([48], [50, 51], 'POS')]
Can be surely preferred as your first iphone Value for money Some what battery is not sufficient but as we already know about the batteries of iphone Camera is up to mark but there is insufficiency of night mode wideangle mode but that’s ok its not a big deal Display performance is good enough Overall lookup is impressive and off course attractive Speakers are mind blowing dual speaker setup which is quite loud compared to others At this price range this phone is best if you are interested in ios####[([81], [8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([13], [16], 'NEG'), ([27], [29, 30, 31], 'POS'), ([27], [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], 'NEU'), ([49], [50, 51, 52], 'POS'), ([81], [55, 56, 57], 'POS'), ([81], [59, 60, 61], 'POS'), ([62], [64, 65], 'POS'), ([66, 67], [71, 72], 'POS'), ([81], [83], 'POS')]
I recently purchased this device ( Motorola g73 5G ) , and I ' m extremely disappointed with its performance . Despite being in areas with strong network signals , the device is not sensing the network and is unable to connect to the internet or make calls . This is a major inconvenience and makes the device practically useless . I would not recommend this product to anyone who needs reliable network connectivity on their mobile device . 5G is not supporting .

It has superb camera and also it ' s light weighted . Rest all are too bad . Battery needs to charge twice in a day . Mobile build quality is not good , it is vibrating during calls .

bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues . So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand . It has been a few days since I have been using this phone . I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good . The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate . The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah . Charging is quite fast . The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well .####[([45], [47, 48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([53], [54, 55, 56], 'POS'), ([59], [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], 'POS'), ([69], [71], 'POS'), ([69], [85, 86, 87, 88], 'POS'), ([91], [93], 'POS'), ([91], [95, 96, 97, 98, 99], 'POS')]

Allover this smartphone is good in this price but when comes in performance Dimensity 6020 is a capable processor but this device 60hz display make this slow .

Phone is descent but the camera software has some issues , even in portrait mode , it doesn ' t beautify the face and overexposes all dark spots , but scenery shooting is descent , battery and performance is excellent , thanks to one ui , Totally value for money , probably best phone in this budget and Knox security gives it the upper hand .####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG'), ([6], [7, 8, 9], 'NEG'), ([5], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'NEG'), ([5], [24, 25, 26, 27], 'NEG'), ([5], [30, 31, 32, 33], 'NEU'), ([35], [39], 'POS'), ([37], [39], 'POS'), ([0], [46, 47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([0], [52, 53, 54, 55, 56], 'POS'), ([58, 59], [60, 61, 62, 63, 64], 'POS')]
Totally worth the price if : - you are a iOS fan - like compact phone - want to switch from android to iPhone - you like clicking some good photos ( camera is unbeatable ) - you multitask ( normal phones get stuck between apps , this will keep you going without a hiatus ( lag ) - you like to listen to music ( have 2 speakers , one on the front , and another below ; when I watch a movie with 4d - 5d music , it feels like Dolby atmos ) There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into ( you can visit youtube for technical features ) .####[([15], [0, 1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([32], [34], 'POS'), ([15], [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], 'POS'), ([15], [96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101], 'POS')]

Awesome product must buy . Well , switching from Android to iOS will make you a little uncomfortable as Siri can ' t understand Hindi . The most important I like about this phone is that Bgmi get opens within 11 to 13 seconds . Speaker is awesome , the display is fantastic , battery is 3200 . And most important speed and camera are incredible . Check my photos . If you want to switch then don ' t buy iPhone 11 or 12 must go for 13 or 14 . Well , I am leaving this review after using it for 1 week . I ordered it on 27 August and I received it on 8 October . Today is 13 October . Thanks , Flipkart for another awesome product . You have always resolved my issues and I have done 3 - 4 lac shopping from this platform till now still waiting for my next want🤗 .

Switching to iOS after Android was a bit weird for me at first but it was such an amazing experience for me . The display looks so crisp and wonderful and the phone never fails to amaze me . The battery life is something that could be better but it is still good enough for hours of gaming .

It ' s a new iPhone ! It ' s faster than the last ones I guess , and it should be good for the next 80k miles . The only gripes I might have , probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS . I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer , and it seems my screen isn ' t nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR . As I ' ve said though , it ' s most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out . Still a nice piece of kit , yet no real surprises either . It does have a very nice camera for photos and video .####[([70], [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81], 'NEG'), ([47], [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'NEG'), ([47], [60, 61, 62, 63, 64], 'NEG'), ([47], [105, 106, 107, 108, 109], 'NEG'), ([5], [113, 114, 115, 116], 'NEU'), ([5], [119, 120, 121, 122], 'NEU'), ([130], [128, 129], 'POS')]
