The phone is cool everything is fine display camera performance everything is good but there should be some improvement in the battery because it runs less according to the capacity of the battery 24 hours backup is good but in gaming 3 to 4 hours is enough but the phone is very good .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative']]
display is as beautiful as it is risky . As curved display are prone to break and this one doesn ' t have any gorilla glass protection . And curved tempered cost 5 times more than regular tempered glass . This model curved tempered cost me around 450 while flat tempered cost around 50 .  Gaming - Average and display during gaming feels like watching it in 240p while setting is set to maximum . Forget even high graphics gaming if you could could game with terrible graphics then go for it .####[['display', 'neutral'], ['display', 'negative'], ['Gaming', 'neutral'], ['Gaming', 'negative']]
Rear camera is awesome but front camera is below standard even 4 years old redmi k20 pro has detail in selfie camera . Selfie camera picture at night is unusable .

One of the best mid - range mobile . Portrait pictures are great , 120 refreshing rate feels amazing . Pubg , cod games can play 90fps . The display is fabulous and the processor is better than SD 778 . Best part phone is very slim and light weight easy to handle and can use for long time with out any pain .  Cons : single mono speakers could be given a stereo dual speaker , 3 . 5mm jack missing , 4k 60fps recording missing in this era . The price is very high best to buy around 25k .

Nice product and it ' s camera is just amazing but slightly disappointed about it ' s processor in this price range there are mobiles which have mediatek 1300 chipset is also available , it is good for who don ' t go for intermediate gaming , but it ' s color changing effect is awesome .  Those guys who love photography can go for this device . In this price range the processor is not up to the mark , should have mediatek dimesity 1300 instead of 900 .####[['mobiles', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['processor', 'negative']]
I have Vivo v15 pro and expected that it will have same camera as that . But it only have 64 and 50 mp camera but it ' s quality is like 15k phone camera .

Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone .    Best features with stunning looks & performance .    Battery life is very good .

Totally worth the price if :    - you are a iOS fan  - like compact phone  - want to switch from android to iPhone  - you like clicking some good photos ( camera is unbeatable )  - you multitask ( normal phones get stuck between apps , this will keep you going without a hiatus ( lag )  - you like to listen to music ( have 2 speakers , one on the front , and another below ; when I watch a movie with 4d - 5d music , it feels like Dolby atmos )    There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into ( you can visit youtube for technical features ) .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]

Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it . It’s super fast , has an awesome pair of camera , punchy speaker , good looks , beautiful screen , perfect size and an amazing user experience . Everything about this phone is no nonsense .    Coming to battery , I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage , it easily lasts 24 hours . It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that , you know you have got a bad habit to put off .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative']]

Let ' s face it . The main reason you ' re even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn ' t compromise on power . Getting OS updates for another 4 - 5 years , with a decent camera , waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage .    There ' s a few things it could ' ve done better :    1 . Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage .  2 . The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio .  3 . Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement .  4 . Fast charging####[['camera', 'neutral'], ['charging', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]

Phone call : almost 1 % reduction for every 4 - 5 mins .    Which seems to be bit faster consumption . First iPhone I’m using . I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate . But this doesn’t look nice to me .####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative']]
After using this Device as my daily driver for over a month i can say that , It’s inbuilt AI and Machine Learning is so good that it manages all my things by itself , and even after having a small battery of 1800 MAH , it performs all day with some juice left , which is impressive . Awesome Camera , amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic .  Suggestion go for 128GB it will help you in long run . Overall a very good and nice product .####[['inbuilt AI', 'positive'], ['Machine Learning', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Performance', 'positive'], ['product', 'positive']]
This Phone is Simply Brilliant . The fastest mobile processor from Apple , A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat . The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation . Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor . Definetely a Value for your Buck .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['A13 bionic chip', 'positive'], ['Camera performance', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'positive']]
First of all we will talk about battery it has 1800 mah battery , but u know what it works like 4000 mah truly amazing phone with optical image stabilization in video with editing option 64 gb variant is too good go for it####[['phone', 'positive']]
Battery will give good performance for a normal user  I suggest another variant for heavy users  Cam quality is good in day light conditions  Performance is very good with A13 Bionic chip  Small in size and don’t expect a screen size like MI or one plus full screen mobiles####[['Battery', 'positive'], ['Cam quality', 'positive'], ['A13 Bionic chip', 'positive'], ['size', 'negative']]
This is an amazing phone for the price . For someone coming from a pure Android background , migrating data would take a little time , and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1 - 2 days . Once it is all set , I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup . The backup with the 1800 mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity .  Camera is amazing for my use , as the lighting and colour tone are Natural , close to what we would see with our bare eyes . I did not see any grains kicking in during low light conditions .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'positive']]
This is my first iPhone . And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable . The camera is better in every way . The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame / sec super slow motion recording . Performance is way too better than android . This is fast , very very fast . If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok . In fact this is the only issue with this phone . This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most . In single word this is the RED DAGGER for android flagships phones .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'neutral']]
The performance iss as expected great , the battery life is not actually a concern , but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww . Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager , with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20 % left and you could get near to 80 , . Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming , 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season .  Camera is good enough for the price don ' t expect flagship level performance , as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me .  Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros ,  Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features ,  And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .  You can buy this even for the mrp of the phone without hesitation .####[['performance', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['charging speed', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'positive'], ['iphone', 'positive'], ['iphone', 'neutral'], ['ios 14', 'positive']]
I jumped from old SE to the new SE . the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm .  The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design . Looks so good in white colour .  Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU .  If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it . But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed , CAMERA , looks , iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device .  Battery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don’t play games this device is giving me 5 - 6 hrs of usage time ( you tube , camera , music , browsing , etc etc )  M using white colour with product red apple leather case . This is the perfect contrast with white colour .  Overall rating - 8 / 10  just because of battery performance .####[['Performance', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['CAMERA', 'positive'], ['iOS ecosystem', 'positive']]
iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof . .  Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it .  It is good for email surfing , browsing , couple of videos per day .  Camera quality is not superb but good in day light  Video is extraordinary i can say  Performance speed is tremendous  Battery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands .    White color stand unique in crowd . . because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets . .  Can go for red one as well .####[['iPhone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'neutral']]

This is my first iPhone . I would say that coming from Android , there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it .    Coming to the phone itself , camera is amazing minus the low light photography part . Battery backup is ok ok . I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low . Also since I am mostly at home , it doesn’t matter so much . Display is ok . Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse . But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand .    Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run . It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game , battery will tale a hit .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Display', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'negative']]
One of the best handsets , very easy to carry & handle . Exceptional performance & amazing display , however battery is the only concern . It consumes more battery when you use internet , especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures . Otherwise everything thing is perfect . People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this . But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger .####[['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['handsets', 'positive']]
Very nice phone . Actually it ' s my first iPhone so I was very excited . Nd I ' m happy with this phone .  Nice phone for gaming , battery backup is not that much for gaming but I suggest buy one good powerbank or fast charger . If u have small fingers then it ' s best device for u .####[['iPhone', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative']]
It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it , the camera is a beast , the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use , if ur a heavy user you ' d need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get really good game play , worth the money , between if ur coming for a larger screen , you might feel it ' s a lil too small but honestly it ' s not really that small , so buy it , it ' s perfect .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['screen', 'neutral']]
It’s a beast in performance , only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography . Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it , not meant for heavy users . It can handle each and every task very easily . Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it , whether a heavy gameplay or exporting / rendering of heavy videos . Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand . I’ve been using it for more than 9 months . It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above . And it’s my first time experiencing ios , and it is extremely smooth and optimized .  Thanks .####[['Battery backup', 'neutral'], ['ios', 'positive'], ['device', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['Battery backup', 'negative']]
I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary . The user interface and the camera is too good . Just in love with this extraordinary device . I just shared some photos clicked from this phone so that everyone can have an idea about how good the camera is compared all other flagship devices . The lens inside the device is so efficient that it automatically reduces the noise in the picture making it very crisp and clear .####[['user interface', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['device', 'positive']]
Picture quality is amazing you do not need to think twice about buying this for performance and photos , just go for it . Bionic A 15 is super fast and it has amazing performance ,  It is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user ,  But if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge .####[['battery backup', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'neutral'], ['Bionic A 15', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]

It ' s a new iPhone ! It ' s faster than the last ones I guess , and it should be good for the next 80k miles . The only gripes I might have , probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS . I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer , and it seems my screen isn ' t nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR . As I ' ve said though , it ' s most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out . Still a nice piece of kit , yet no real surprises either . It does have a very nice camera for photos and video .####[['screen', 'negative'], ['iOS', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'positive']]
The most premium feeling I ever had while holding a phone was of this iphone 13 .  This is my first iPhone apart from having ipad pro but i can guarentee you that it had the most premium in hand experience .  The flipkart service was awesome and it got delivered before expected date . Hats off !  Overall an excellent experience it was . An iphone is not hyped just for no reason .####[['iphone 13', 'positive'], ['flipkart', 'positive']]
Awesome product must buy . Well , switching from Android to iOS will make you a little uncomfortable as Siri can ' t understand Hindi . The most important I like about this phone is that Bgmi get opens within 11 to 13 seconds . Speaker is awesome , the display is fantastic , battery is 3200 . And most important speed and camera are incredible . Check my photos . If you want to switch then don ' t buy iPhone 11 or 12 must go for 13 or 14 . Well , I am leaving this review after using it for 1 week . I ordered it on 27 August and I received it on 8 October . Today is 13 October . Thanks , Flipkart for another awesome product . You have always resolved my issues and I have done 3 - 4 lac shopping from this platform till now still waiting for my next want .

The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s . The battery life is longer . And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro ( even on a non - Pro phone ) .  Yes , the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land . But it’s more about what this chip lets you do . This includes Cinematic mode , which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus , and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics .####[['display', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['A15 Bionic', 'positive'], ['Cinematic mode', 'positive']]
Switched from android to iOS .  In hand feel of iPhone 13 is very good . . superb to be precise because of its 6 . 1 inch display .  Battery performance is simply awesome .

I became first user of I phone . Let ' s start with the design . One of many things that  a lot of people , including me , love about Apple ' s  iPhones is the familiarity that they bring to the  table year - on - year while being ingenious enough to  make subtle changes in the design . Heavy HDR camera performance .####[['camera performance', 'positive'], ["Apple ' s", 'positive']]
Worth for the money for those who like to enjoy a normal 6 inch mobile device . Awesome experience of having a new iPhone 13 in hand .  The picture clarity is good . Battery is 5 / 5 for me when compared other apple models . Make sure that we use the compatible adapter and do not overcharge to maintain the battery percentage in goodness level .####[['iPhone 13', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]
Excellent product . I always had a question why would someone want to invest 50k + on a mobile phone but now my views have changed .  Photos are just amazing its really hard to imagine how good the photos are even in the low light conditions  With A15 chip inside you - can throw any task at it and it will perform without any lag be games or your office work just so easy to work around and switch between multiple apps without getting them close .  Moving from Android to IPhone I do see some good and some bad experiences but yeah they’re different OS bound to have differences but loving it here .####[['Photos', 'positive'], ['A15 chip', 'positive'], ['IPhone', 'positive']]
Most valuable product . Got this for 66k and its worth enough to spend on premium products . The UI looks super clean and the body got metal on the sides and glass finish on the back . The quality of camera is good enough . No distortion in images and no noise . Its working on ios 16 . 1 . 2 , will get more further updates as apple claims for 5 years of giving frequent security as well as bug fixes updates .####[['UI', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['apple', 'positive']]
Writing review after using 2 weeks its good phone , Camera was superb then any android phones , I am android users but after using iOS software I loved it , it was smooth and no lag at all after playing heavy games with high settings , A15 bionic chipset was really fast and battery efficient its last almost one day with heavy usage , Overall phone was very good in every perspective , thanks to the Flipkart for fastest delivery !####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['iOS', 'positive'], ['A15 bionic chipset', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Flipkart', 'positive']]
Apple as always surprises with the fluidity of the UI and the esthetics design , I ' m upgrading from XS to 13 and I ' m not regretting a bit , I mean dont get me wrong XS is a stunning phone after 3 odd years of time with it , never felt sluggish but iPhone 13 is a big jump and a game changer love the design , love the UI and the haptics of course very clean look and feel . I got this phone for 52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days , Thanks to flipkart the delivey was even more faster as expected . I will definitely come back after 3 months of usage with the review . donno about the battery life but definitely better than the XS .####[['iPhone 13', 'positive'], ['haptics', 'positive'], ['UI', 'positive'], ['flipkart', 'positive']]
Just okay , nothing great really . More hype , less substance . Camera is downright disappointing . It’s great on the pro models , but not on this one . Low - light photography is good , but daylight photography is a disaster . Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom . My four - year old Samsung S9 plus produced far superior quality images than this . So I’m really disappointed with the cameras on this phone and repent having payed a fortune for the same . Avoid buying this phone if you are looking for good quality cameras , go for Samsung’s flagship S - series phones instead . This one is more of a show - off .####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['cameras', 'negative'], ['cameras', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'neutral']]
Good phone Please Use Iphone 13 In Low Power Mode for Good Battery performance , Also Good Display 1 problem with display 60Hz refresh rate but iOS adjust this and give me best display performance smoother than Android Phone with 60Hz , My brother banged it against the wall but nothing happened except a crack on Display So Durability is Good Over All price this phone price little bit costly but phone is good , Ill give some camera samples in photos####[['Iphone 13', 'positive'], ['Battery performance', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Iphone 13', 'negative']]
1st time using an iPhone . Didn’t expect to blend in so easily . Though it is different from android , however the system is still easy to use and super responsive .

It’s a perfect one . Build quality , camera ( don’t need to say anything on it ) , iOS , everything is good . You don’t need an upgrade for next 4 to 5 years .

It ' s beautiful and apple . but when i look back at my S22 Plus , this feels like a mediocre device from apple . i am not saying it ' s bad , but android is way ahead in terms of performance , battery , camera ( yess , samsung camera is amazing ) and connectivity .  It took me 30 minutes to connect and organize this iPhone to my car but android auto worked like magic and connects in less than 3 seconds . It ' s funny but this is real world data i am talking about . Then there are ads , i have system wide ad block installed on android and on iPhone u can ' t do that . Battery control is alot better on android again due to various software tweaks and it makes ur phone live for 2 days while iPhone is just barely 1 day . Okay enough of it . IPhone is best if you are iPhone fan . And let ' s leave android for productivity people .####[['iPhone', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]
After a very long time I switched back to the iPhone . Because I was using android devices since very long time , now I find it bit difficult work with it fluently .

Though , I am still using android phone as my secondary phone , because android is best for the entertainment purpose .####[['iphone', 'positive']]

I bought this mobile in may 2022 , i wxchanged my old redmi not 7 pro for 8k , got this for 62k after that . So this my first ever flagship mobile and first i phone . So for a normal budget android user here are my reviews    Camera - just average , the pro models have better camera i guess , back camera is good and takes good pics , but front camera is too average , problem is android phones like redmi has too many gimmicks and it makes you look too attractive ( which is fake ) my wife likes redmi phone####[['Camera', 'neutral'], ['back camera', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'neutral']]

The iPhone 13 is a fantastic device . The camera system is top - notch , producing beautiful and detailed photos and videos . The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning - fast performance , making multitasking and gaming a breeze . The 5G capability is also a great addition , allowing for faster internet speeds and improved connectivity . The Ceramic Shield front cover provides better durability and drop protection . The battery life is also impressive , lasting throughout the day with moderate use . The only downside is the high price tag . Overall , I highly recommend the iPhone 13 to anyone in the market for a new phone .####[['iPhone 13', 'positive'], ['camera system', 'positive'], ['A15 Bionic chip', 'positive'], ['5G', 'positive'], ['Ceramic Shield', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'neutral'], ['iPhone 13', 'negative']]

The migration from android to IOS is so painful .  First the phone : A solid one , boxy and feels good in hand . Excellent display , camera is good , battery …amazing . For some reason I see that my mobile signal is weak , this was not the case with my android phone .  Second the IOS : I didn’t find it amusing . From a customisation perspective it is probable 5 years behind android . There are certain simple things are missing , it’s a long list . But from a RAM and battery management , it is outstanding . From an user experience perspective , I am really struggling .    Best part is , I got it in sale for a good price after trading in my old phone .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['IOS', 'negative'], ['RAM', 'positive']]

Fantastic , useful , excellent , protective , fine camera , good storage if you want all these demands in one phone fulfilled go for iphone 13 these are very good if you are a regular phone user excellent if you want gaming smoothness and little fps too then go for 13 or 14 pro as a new and first iphone user i am comfortable in all aspects and last one I love apple iphone 13####[['iphone 13', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['storage', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Phone is good . But within a week of use with proper protection cover , I saw paint of silent button chipped off . Its very bad thing to see in apple iphone . May be make in India quality is not upto the mark as compared to US or China make .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'negative']]
Everything was well and good expect for the delivery boy , I mean what can I say , everybody needs to check the every detail of their new i phone that they bought , but for some reason this guy was in a hurry like he is about to catch a train after this and make the whole process unenjoyable !####[['phone', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
It works really well More than anything I enjoy flaunting my three eyed phone and Apple  Logo ! Of course it’s a costly phone and I won’t justify its price tag .

OMG , 13 Max Pro is a ultimate bundle of smart phone Camera is like DSLR and the phone performance is absolutely fine ya it’s very expensive 1 but if you want something different with better perform you should grab it .  Battery backup is good I charge it once in 1 . 5 days so it is good for me .

Great phone from Apple . Excellent display with variable refresh rate . Feels very light on hand . Great battery stand by time . Amazing delivery speed by Flipkart .

Been using this phone for last 2 months . This is my first iphone . I’ve just switched from android . This phone is expensive but kinda worth it . In love with this phone , the camera which I don’t need to say anything about .  I hope it will last more than 3 years .  every feature is awesome . The touch quality too love it####[['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['touch', 'positive']]
all things are good but it has 2 major issues , it heats up when you do a little bit gaming and it has serious network issues and wifi issues then android . network and wifi connections are much better on android . all other things are best####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
I ' ve never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max . I finally pulled the trigger and got it .    Now coming to the phone , it ' s nothing short of amazing . It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it . If you ' re sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart , don ' t be . It ' s a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neat    The only downside I see to this phone is the storage . I got the 128 GB model and feel that it is waaay to low if you use the cameras regularly .    Overall very satisfied with the purchase .####[['storage', 'negative'], ['cameras', 'negative'], ['13 Pro Max', 'positive']]
Fantastic product even though it ' s just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro . The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it ' s beautiful . Dynamic island is very practical and useful . Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it .    Flipkart ' s delivery was quick and hassle free . The order was delivered on the launch date and was packed well .####[['iphone 13 pro', 'positive'], ["Flipkart ' s", 'positive']]
Earlier I had plan to go with S23 + but buying a iphone is a personal preference , i have gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I / we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android . I would rate s23 + 10 / 10 and even iphone 14 pro 10 / 10 as the only difference i could see is the os .####[['iphone', 'positive']]
It ' s my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation I love the color , I love the accessibility of the phone . . . .

I was using Iphone 6s and also Oneplus 6t . Both mobiles were perfectly alright in Photos , gaming , and smooth interface . My 6s mobile getting battery issue . thought upgrade to 11 .

iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display . The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment .

Cameras are awesome , battery backup excellent , great performance and a decent premium look .####[['iphone 11', 'positive'], ['display', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['Cameras', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'positive']]
Amazing camera quality as expected , battery also has very good performance . Display , body , and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had . Sound quality of speakers is more than sufficient . Apple is known for it’s customer friendly security services and I can see it how . The A13 processor is the best in its work . So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it , just go for it without delay .    The most amazing thing it the delivery . Flipkart has delivered it in the span of 17hrs .

It’s been 7 years I was waiting for an income for my first iPhone . it was like a dream to me and finally I achieved it . Why chose iPhone ? ? It’s a premium standard level phone maybe you could find other brands value like this but not all those are iPhone . If you are thinking to buy an iPhone don’t think too much grab it bro . Being an an iPhone owner can give you a feeling like owning an Lamborghini in your pocket According to me a middle class family boy .####[['iPhone', 'positive']]

This is my first ever I phone . Before this I was using my google nexus 5 . But moving from android to iOS is a great experience . It’s worth at this price . I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS . The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life . This two things have won my heart . I loved it . Happy to have it in my hand . Still exploring its features . And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service . Very prompt service and fast delivery .####[['iOS', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Flipkart', 'positive']]
Best in class . Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD . But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands . Portrait mode is best to click pictures .

It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone . I upgraded from an iPhone 8 . The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery .

I have received this product on 18th March , thanks to Flipkart that he product was received very fast . This is the genuine review of the phone which I have felt on my side . The product is overall good enough . The camera I feel little bad , in the day light its ok . . and even in the night we can take the photos but when the light is not good enough the photos are not good . The battery wise is ok i am changing 2 times in a day ( not fully dropped ) . I am using the phone by data connection full time on . The video quality is not upto the mark . I think they will look into that in future updates . Performance wise and display wise no words to say its excellent . So please look into the camera performance and the battery side this is the only request from my side .

I ' ve had a fantastic experience with Motog73 so far . I could not imagine these many features in a phone ( particularly in this price range ) , and the camera really steals the show with its 2micron 50MP imaging system . This phone produces visually captivating , lively , colorful , and stunning images straight out of the box so I won ' t have to spend time making a lot of changes . The night light also captures incredible pictures without any blurring areas . When it comes to taking pictures , it comfortably beats my friend ' s oneplus phone which is famous for its camera . The colors are very vibrant and eye - catching . and the display is legible even in bright sunlight . Playing games and watching movies is another enjoyable experience on g73 . In terms of daily performance also , the phone is quick and smooth . I ' ve been using it for over a week now and the experience has been wonderful !####[['Motog73', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive']]
The phone is excellent , very smooth and easy to run . Camera has massively improved as per Motorola standards but the . LCD display , used in sunlight to see , it is not bad but not something that will make you happy . Average is the word . I do not play games so no comments . I played music , the sound is crisp and very pleasant . Phone calls are good . 5G works very well . There is a very good option to protect 5g from draining your data , phone puts you on 4g . Bloatware has started off , it is not the kind the earlier generation of Moto g . But manageable unlike Realme , Redmi etc . Android 13 is great . Sadly you will get just one update .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'neutral'], ['sound', 'positive'], ['Bloatware', 'positive']]

Not a good product . I bought it as it was advertised for 2 micrometer camera which just turned out to be a hype . Camera is just average .    This phone does not support 5g at the moment . Not sure when company is releasing update to support 5g .    Better to go for poco x4 pro which is at same price banfld with amoled panel and is 5 g ready    Motorola has released a half baked product which does not seem to justify the price .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral']]
Product is awesome in this price range .  Camera performance is good because of its ultra pixel technology and ultrawide lens is too good in this price range as it work as macro and depth sensor which gives more details and no other brand is providing ultrawide lens in this range .  Type C To C charger is provided in the box which is good  Processor is also good as it provide smooth experience in gaming and also It has 120hz refresh rate which is dynamic .  Cons battery backup is less if we compared to other phones but its satisfactory .####[['phones', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['charger', 'positive'], ['Processor', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative']]
This phone is just lit . Good Looking design . Looks like premium . Night photos are phenomenal . Stock Android with a powerful processor under 20000 . The battery is also great .

At first thanks to Flipkart for delivery in 1day.  Performance of this phone is very good and smooth. I feel it's really 120z. No Network issues in my Village always show 4G+ signal. Clean UI and stock Android.  Secure folder is available. One thing that I miss i.e theme because you can't customise your phone with various types of themes and wallpaper. You only use system wallpaper and theme.  There is no available gallery, file management, Music player apps like other brand phones. All apps are working with Google products.  Video quality is good HDR supported.####[]
ve been using the Moto G73 5G for a while now, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its performance. The phone has a large 6.5-inch screen with a high refresh rate that makes scrolling through apps and websites smooth and seamless. The 5G connectivity is also a big plus, as I can easily stream videos, make video calls, and download large files without any lag.  The phone's battery life is impressive, lasting me through a full day of moderate to heavy usage. I also appreciate the phone's fast charging capabilities, which allow me to top up the battery quickly when needed.####[]
If you want haptics then it ' s not for you poor vibration  Battery is nice but charging is slow .

The review I am writing after 10 days of usage . The initial impression is really good . The display is crystal clear and is soft on eyes . Functioning of phone is very smooth .  I am yet to explore the phone fully but the basic usage has satisfied me a lot and some very useful features of phone , like karate chop switching on of torch light , twist and open the camera are very handy . 10 days of use is quite less to write an extensive review but it gives an idea of the quality of product to an extent .  Overall seems to me a good buy and value for money . I prefer separate slot for SDCard and as this phone has a hybrid slot for sim cards and SDCard so I have to adjust with this shortcoming for my preference .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]
Good phone for stock android lovers . camera is also descent ( use GCAM for better results ) . Amoled screen is missing , still screen is good .

I ordered Moto G73 on 16th March which was delivered to me on 18th March . I would like to share that its battery life is really pathetic . Even if the phone is not in use , the battery drains very fast . It has happened a couple of times now that the battery was at around 55 % at 11 pm ( when I put the phone on DND ) . When I checked the phone the next day at 7 am , the phone was off ! The battery drains very fast even at DND mode .####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative']]

I recently purchased this device ( Motorola g73 5G ) , and I ' m extremely disappointed with its performance . Despite being in areas with strong network signals , the device is not sensing the network and is unable to connect to the internet or make calls .

I would not recommend this product to anyone who needs reliable network connectivity on their mobile device . 5G is not supporting . Total waste product .####[['Motorola g73 5G', 'negative']]

I have seen many reviews regarding battery issues , but didn ' t consider , TRUSTED THE BRAND .  Display is good , CPU consumes more battery while doing some sort of heavy operations like app install , update install .  Dimensity 930 need some more optimisation , moto should fix this battery issues ASAP .  Camera is below average .  Better to look some other alternatives in this price range .####[['device', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Dimensity 930', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative']]
Totally money waste mobile . Doesn ' t worth the money . Camera quality is not good even sometime mobile lags . I applied for return but they rejected . Never trust Motorola and Flipkart . And this phone is totally waste only speakers are of good quality but camera totally waste of money .####[['Camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['speakers', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative']]
This is my first moto phone that I ' m using since a week and observe . Performance is good no doubt but somehow annoyed by battery performance and camera quality .

Display and camera are the only cons i felt . Everything else is justified for the price . I should have purchased the moto g82 because of the oled display .

Moto g73 is an over priced mid range phone with a lot of cellular call connectivity issues and call drops / call reception issues . Coming to sound Speaker on full volume settings vibrates on the back of the phone . Volume settings Speaker on below 80 % is not audible . Screen quality is not up to the pricing mark of the phone . Finger print goes non responsive randomly .  Apart from clean Android UI experience nothing is fine .  A big No !  Missed out the return period window !####[['Moto g73', 'negative'], ['Speaker', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'negative'], ['Finger print', 'negative'], ['UI', 'negative']]

Not met the expectations of what Motorola promised . Performance is something I was looking for and this phone just did not meet the expectations . Hangs up a lot while multitasking . I ' m not a gamer , basic smartphone user . A lot of parties complained about voice congestion and loss of clarity while talking . Looks like the mic is not up to the mark . Overall it ' s okay to use a smartphone and not worth the money spent .####[['Motorola', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['mic', 'negative']]
After 3 days problem started . Screen becomes dark . Nothing worked . Showed system UI not responding .

Mobile working is very bad  Camera doesn ' t have stability and image quality is poor  Mobile screen refresh rate is good  Battery capacity is not that good  Screen display is lcd and makes eyes very irritative and bad screen quality  Mobile getting heated about 43 for normal usage also  Ram is not like 8 it ' s just nearer to 6  Finally mobile is not worthable for that price####[['Mobile', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Battery capacity', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['Ram', 'negative'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['Screen display', 'negative']]
The design looks too old . No one believes it is a new phone that costs over 15k . Should have gone for iqoo z7 , bought this only because Flipkart offered a 3k exchange bonus for my OnePlus 5 which worked flawlessly with a broken screen .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['Flipkart', 'positive']]
Battery performance is not so good and is hangs sometimes , also some features are not available in this device which are available in others phone even lower in budget to this phone .####[['Battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Battery backup is not good . Only 4 to 5 hours battery backup after charging 100 % . bad experience for battery backup . Camera 3 out of 5 .

Phone could have been better but it is still pretty good . No lag . Camera is okay . Other phones offer better camera . But great battery backup and I love some other features of this phone .

I am writing this review after one weeks usage , display quality is good . if you are not a heavy gamer , battery easily lasts for one day for normal usage on single charge . And charger is super fast no doubt about it with in half an hour your battery is charged fully . Good phone in this budget for normal usage , looks sturdy as well .####[['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Camera quality is up to the mark , in night mode you get proper picture . Ultra sound mode is there which works fine . You will love the smoothness while operating and texting .

This phone is good looking and has great exteriors . The phone doesn ' t lags . Performance wise it is amazing . Also , the BATTERY . . ! Is superamazing . It charges within 15 - 20mins to 80 % .

Good looking phone . Fast with 5000 MAH battery . Camera is also good . Just one issue that I ' d doesn ' t charge as fast as it says . With 65 watt charger it takes around an hour to charge .

This phone has over 100 megapixel camera 6x zoom and 5000 mah battery but it doesn ' t feel like a OnePlus phone . I used OnePlus Nord for 3 years but the phone never lagged or got stuck even once . This phone started to lag on the 2nd day itself . Not a good buy .

The video quality is very poor . You can apply only up to 1080p60 . Camera quality is below average from my point of view .

I recommend you don ' t buy it if you are a camera lover .####[['Camera', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
I expected a bit more but ONEPLUS failed to satisfy . Overall the performance is average . Camera quality is very bad as they mentioned 108MP and it is not worthy . But the front camera is good .

it ' s looking good but end of the day you won ' t feel that you are using OnePlus mobile , you will get notified so much difference between this and flagship in OnePlus mobiles , finally it ' s not suggestable , it is suggestable if it is available around 16k to 17k####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['OnePlus', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'neutral']]
Highly disappointed with connection In your 1st call ncoming and outgoing the phone will be silent we can ' t here anything after 3rd time it can be audible and voice very low the can ' t here properly , phone gives back 12hrs the only advantage it ' s faster charging at Max 20mins , connectivity it ' s worse always hving network issue of mobile data , my kind suggestion don ' t buy it .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Sometimes it works fine sometimes it has some software issues , it ' s not running smoothly , specially while typing on fb I faced some weird keyboard issues , while trying to open YouTube it get stuck , though the network is fine after getting the notification the message isn ' t shown immediately sometime , I have to close tab and reopen the app several times to work it properly####[['', 'neutral'], ['', 'negative'], ['', 'positive']]

Worst product in the market . Most of the time I ' m not able to use internet and hotspot is totally waste in OnePlus Nord 2T .

If your budget is 7000 then believe me this is the best choice , I ' m writing this review after one month use . over all performance is good . No lag during free fire at smooth graphics , No fingerprint sensor but its okey bcoz they already provided many features . 5000 mAh battery is amazing . it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use . and one day at highest use . I played free fire for 30 min and Amazing thing that battery used is only 5 % . this a the real value for money phone , full paisa wasul phone . also supports VoLTE calling and WiFi . big screen .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive']]
Haven ' t got any complaints overall , good built quality , display is vibrant enough and bright , battery life is on the better side , lasts a while . It can feel a bit slow and take some time to load apps up but that ' s to be expected with a 2 GB RAM The camera could ' ve been better , it takes great vibrant photos but bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details . Not very fond of the audio unit , music sounds way harsh without any bass or the finer sounds .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['2 GB RAM', 'negative'], ['2 GB RAM', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive']]
I got it for 6 . 5k and at that price point it ' s Recommended . I have used it for More than 6 months now .

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given . So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media .####[['camera', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['smart phone', 'positive'], ['ram', 'neutral'], ['smart phone', 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive']]
Bought it for ₹6799 . Still working proper after 2 years . Battery life on normal usage is about 1 - 1½ days , if used only for making calls then about 5 - 6 days .

I bought this phone for my mom . She ' s been using this phone since an year . I always buy redmi because they ' ve gained my trust . My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime . They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust , but shockingly , the phone was utter disappointment . My mom is a very light user . She only uses phone for calling and youtube . But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks . It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera . I resetted the phone , updated software , everything but of no use . Never expected this from a trustful brand like redmi . I suggest you guys to take little more priced phones from redmi , entry level phones are poor in performance .
