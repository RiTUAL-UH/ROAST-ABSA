Battery drains too fast on the running of location services and the battery last around 8 to 9 hours while using location services continuously . The PPI should have to more as compared to previous smartphone . The brightness is very low as mentioned by the realme . It ' s not around 1300 nits as I have another phone which has peak brightness of 1000 nits and much more brighter than GT 2 . Hence , the peak brightness of GT 2 is less than 1000 nits .####[['Battery', 'negative'], ['GT 2', 'negative']]
If you are confused between iqoo 9se and realme GT2 . I can say that just buy realme , it is full of features , customization and it ' s look is super . I must say if you want a balanced phone in every term , you should look to this phone .  BUT BUT BUT  There is a major problem which is Direct video call from google dailer . When I tried to do video call then it only shows black screen on both mobiles so buy it if you are a gamer not for official use . This is a suggestion for you all####[['realme GT2', 'positive'], ['realme GT2', 'negative']]

Need to buy charger seperately for full support of 45W . It charges within 60 minutes most of time and screen on time is 6 - 7 hours . The fort is nearly 10 - 15 kms away from my home and zoom and clearty after taking pics it ' s just awesome . Had to buy this one as it gives few more features than Apple . Portraits are good too .

The first time you look at it , it isn ' t that impressive , but once you touch it , god what a feeling . The device is aesthetic and looks better with lot of light around . The phantom black is awesome .    Coming to the cameras , they are better than any phone out there . When i say any phone that includes an iPhone too . The first time in my life , i don ' t feel like adding any filter or do any edits to my pics . They are just perfect .

Fantastic mobile in all means . This is the best Android in market without doubt and I feel this is far better than latest iPhone in terms of quality and features .  Noted my observations after 2 weeks of usage .    But think twice before buying this from Flipkart . Such a pathetic service . I bought this phone in exchange of my S20 Fe 5g . My mobile was in flawless condition and the exchange amount was 22k . But during inspection they told it has a scratch on side and 3k will be deducted . It was just a very minor line on the side and because of that they deducted 3000Rs . Absolutely ridiculous . So think before exchanging your phone and getting this product .####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['Flipkart', 'negative']]
Great product . First time using a Samsung device and so far so good . Will write more in details after a few weeks of usage . But the overall experience so far has been excellent . It s worth buying .####[['product', 'positive']]
After one month of use I found facial recognition and fingerprint scanner are not good being ultra top model from Samsung it should work flawlessly night time it doesn ' t recognize your face and about fingerprint scanner u have to put lots of effort to unlock your phone by multiple time scanning your finger by applying different amount of force on the screen .####[['facial recognition', 'negative'], ['fingerprint scanner', 'negative']]
worst thing about the phone is night photography . its very poor and AI enhancements feel very cheap . front camera is not as good as a flagship in terms of Camera apple is way ahead of Samsung  i hope there is some software update in future which fixes the issue  already regretting buying .    display is good and overall performance is very good . but if you are buying this for the camera then don ' t go for it####[['night photography', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE . It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user ' s finger doesn ' t slide smoothly .  The software is very very poor . It doesn ' t have basic facilities like scheduled power on / off . The camera focusing and software is poor .  The phone doesn ' t allow user to do even basic settings like adjusting touch sensitivity . The user has to try multiple times to slide down the notification panel . These drawbacks are not due to any physical defects but due to very poor software and hardware design . The user can do only a few settings compared to other phones .  I did not want to buy a Chinese phone so I purchased this but now I have come to know that Redmi 6A is cheaper and far far better than this phone both software and hardware wise .####[['PHONE', 'positive'], ['PHONE', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative'], ['camera focusing', 'negative'], ['hardware design', 'negative']]

I ' ve been using it for a week now . And it did heat a lot in first 2days of use . But now this doesn ' t happen anymore .  Battery is not upto the mark but I ' m an average user so it lasts a day for me .

Display is amazing and touch is superfluid just like any other samsung flagship phone .####[['Battery', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['Display', 'positive']]
Camera is amazing and crisp . Colours are close to accurate . It misses telephoto lens which can be understood because of its design .

People don ' t expect it to be very strong , but it actually is . Samsung did an amazing task here .    At last it ' s a beautiful piece of engineering . It feels premium and stylish .

All the reviews will tell you all the spec related good things here . . But , I ' ve been using xiaomi phones since 2016 , and I gotta tell you the experience of transferring from MIUI to samsung ' s One UI is just amazing . .

At first hands - on , looks like a pretty solid phone considering the form factor . The obvious tradeoff is the battery life , I ' m getting around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi always on and no sim card . Apart from that the only other issue I feel is that the hinge and folding mechanism is slightly weaker than the Flip 4 as I have used the Flip 4 in Samsung cafe stores and they seem tougher than the Flip 3 .####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
I got this phone yesterday and have spent most of my time exploring it . Its a superb phone and except for Battery backup I dont think there is any flaw .

The features are nice , after 6 months of use only , while folding the phone air is getting trapped between screen guard and the screen . Some times , the phone just hangs like the usual android .

The camera performance is best in this price segment .   Screen is smooth as silk .

bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues . So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand . It has been a few days since I have been using this phone . I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good .  The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate .  The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah .  Charging is quite fast .  The camera is good and serves the purpose pretty well .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]
I ' m not a gamer but i can say the gamer won ' t be that disappointed .  One issue i notice is that this phone comes with a few bloat ware which u can uninstall .  When you make carrier video calling have noticed a few issue . Might get addresses in the next update .  In one word you won ' t be disappointed . It is but pricey but with exchange if you get this phone by 20k to 25k this tat is a good deal .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['bloat ware', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]

I have received the phone after lots and lots if efforts . One should really thanks Flipkart for messing up the things . Delivery experience was worst . There is no responsibility to anyone in flipkart .  The phone is good in looks . It ' s just a day I have used this phone . So far it seems ok .  1 . Looks are good  2 . Built is good but the plastic frame makes the phone delicate  3 . Cameras are good  4 . Battery seems ok but not yet tested  5 . Connectivity is good  6 .

1st Vivo purchase . Was a little sceptical before buying . But i am impressed . Excellent display , Good Battery backup , Good Camera and smooth touch with no sign of lag .

Mobile looks and display is great but not good with camera quality specially at night shots . May be taking some nice pics during day but can not say great . It ' s not value for money .

Honest review after 6 months . This is not a very good phone . This phone is very slow and number of apps hanged in this app . It is just a wastage of money . V20 is far better than this phone . Really disappointed with VIvo this time . I ' m using vivo mobile since last 8 years but this time vivo didn ' t gave their best in this smartphone .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['VIvo', 'negative']]
100 % real review . I ' m 2nd time Vivo user 1st phone was vivoz1x , very satisfied and now using v25 pro . In this phone major heating issue occurred when using camera . If using for 1 hour or more lagging start . Speed 6 / 10 Camera 9 / 10 but not upto the mark as Vivo claims . Macro lens is useless . Battery 10 / 10 Charging time 40min approx . Screen 9 / 10 . After using 1hour or more display start lagging also . Although In hand feel very premium . Really disappointed with Vivo this time . Guys this phone is not recommended for heavy use . Don ' t buy it .####[['v25 pro', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'negative'], ['v25 pro', 'positive'], ['Vivo', 'negative']]
Most third class model of vivo . Battery backup very poor . Performance of the Vivi v 25 pro is very poor . Overall don ' t purchase any phone from Flipkart . Their return policy is very bad . After purchasing they take no responsibility to return or refund .####[['Performance', 'negative'], ['Battery backup', 'negative'], ['Flipkart', 'negative'], ['v 25 pro', 'negative']]
after 3 months of usage .  Better wait for Realme 10 pro + which will be at 20 to 25 segment    Apart from display phone is average . . . . . for curved display this is the only phone with value under this range .  Some software bugs are there with banking apps .  Speaker is obsolete rubbish . . . . no Dolby , single mono speaker which is of average quality .  For 1st 10 days as I noticed battery is draining fast .  Sim signals are perfect , as previously used oppo Reno 6 5G I only get 2 or 3 points at home but for this I get complete signal almost every time .  Haptic motar is rubbish , even I never saw this worst haptic feedback in 15K segment , this disappointed me a little when compared to my previous phone .  120 hz i didn ' t feel that fluid when compared to 90 hz in my previous phone . ( refresh rate I tried both in dynamic and 120 hz standalone )  I am not a camera person so no comments on that area .####[['display', 'neutral'], ['software', 'negative'], ['Speaker', 'negative'], ['Speaker', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Haptic', 'negative']]
Over all look and feel it ' s good , if anyone wants to have mobile for normal usage and they can live without curved screen , then I suggest not to go with this .  If you like to use curved display just you can try this .  But apart from curved display this phone is priced very high based on overall performance    And last if you opt for screen damage protection for this phone during service we have to pay an additional 2000 for screen damage .####[['display', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['look', 'positive'], ['feel', 'positive']]
After 6 days of using this Vivo v25 pro , Sound quality is worst . Phone is hanging . Front camera is average . Incoming call voice is worst . We can ' t understand what they are saying .####[['Sound', 'negative'], ['Vivo v25 pro', 'negative'], ['Front camera', 'neutral']]
My review after using it for a week  It doesn ' t show steps  It takes around 1 hour for the complete charge , but I didn ' t find the 66w charge  Camera and performance are good    Unable to find a better cover  For earphone type c to 3 . 5 adaptor not available in the box .

Overall wonderful mobile . But it heats up a little during normal operation . Battery backup is very good . Camera is not upto the mark as per price standard . Pictures looks like we have shoot with mid range camera phones . Pixel tends to break a lot with normal zoom which actually occurs with mid range camera mobiles . So I would rate camera 2 / 5 . . . . and other than camera 5 / 5 . Sound was really great . Loud and crispy .####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'negative'], ['Battery backup', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Sound', 'positive']]
Overall the phone make and build is poor than vivo X80 ( not X80 pro ) . Performance is as same as X80 . Nothing difference is seen for V2 chip or 9200 chip . I wonder how this costly device did not support DP ALT MODE . Overall old Chinese Wine in new bottle . This costly device did not give you premium experience .####[['phone', 'negative']]
Don ' t buy this product it is over heating in charging  And battery backup is too bad once I am charged mobile 100 % it will drained in 4 to 5 hours . i am unsatisfied in this product lost off loss money  it ' s worthless of money####[['battery backup', 'negative'], ['product', 'negative']]
Do not think , just go for it . No one can beat this phone in this price range just amazing camera , battery , performance overall all rounded phone in this price range just buy it if u have this 85k budget . But u have money above 1 lakh then go for s23 ultra or 14 pro . Other than that it ' s superb phone but remember some bloatware apps are there so nothing such issues buy it .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['apps', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
The phone is overall good .  Few things i noted in first 3 days of use :  1 ) battery lasts for an entire day with medium usage .  2 ) speaker output is good and loud .  3 ) still have vivo apps such as - v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled . This should be removed from flagships atleast .  4 ) display is awsome , but LTPO would have been better given the price .  5 ) havent tried heavy gaming , but processor seems capable .  6 ) camera performance is good , but in my old phone i have been using GCAM , so compared to that the stock camera smoothens skin in portrait mode , which i am not a big fan of .  7 ) getting a weird bug , i have JBL Flip 6 , and when its connected , Absolute volume control is not available for some reason . This might be a software bug , but needs to be fixed .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'positive'], ['apps', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['software bug', 'negative']]

My first Vivo phone and surely my last one . The display , though AMOLED , comes nowhere near SAMSUNG sAMOLED . The design is prehistoric , especially with the back dated thick bezels . It makes the device cheap looking . Only a colorful back never makes an attractive phone . Battery drains too fast . Charging speed is satisfactory though . The only redeeming feature is the camera quality of the phone . Would suggest not to waste money on it , rather go for some other mobile .####[['display', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]

This is not just a phone but a piece of Art .  Using this phone is an experience in itself , something ' s which elevates the experience are    1 . Wonderfull screen : The highlight of this phone , a curved display is a delight to use in every possible aspect , paired with fast refresh rate which adds to the overall awesome experience .    2 . Very capable processor : Dimensity 7200 does it ' s work and the phone feels pretty slick and quick to everyday usage , yet to see any lags , i don ' t play games so no idea how it fares in that department .    3 . Audio : although v27 has single speaker system , the sound quality is top notch and gives a great audio experience , though it ' s not very loud but the quality is there .    4 . Camera : Well , it ' s the highlight of this phone and you really need to use the camera to feel it , it takes wonderful photos in every situation , the ring light is not a gimmick and truly is a gamechanger .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['curved display', 'positive'], ['Dimensity 7200', 'positive'], ['single speaker system', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive']]
