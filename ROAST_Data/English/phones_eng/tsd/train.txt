I am writing my review after 10 days and i am extremely happy because I choose the best phone in this segment . . . . . . 1 ) The processor is awesome there is no lag and this phone also has various features like it has various sensors to perform various task . . . . 2 ) For me the camera is awesome ( neither i am a professional photographer nor I like to take photos ) but camera faces problem in low light but overall the camera is good . . . . 3 ) Last thing I wannna say is that everyone is talking about why there is no amoled screen buy genuinely the display is very good with 144 hz of display . . . . . 4 ) SORRY I forget one thing the battery and charger I wana say the battery backup is good I gives me approx 10 - 12 hours of backup the charger is very fast it takes roughly half and hour for my phone to gets completely charged  IF YOU WANT TO BUY A PHONE UNDER 25000 THEN GO FOR REDMI K50I 5G . . . . . . . . . . .####[['REDMI K50I 5G', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['charger', 'positive']]
Using this phone since one year . Best mobile in so far in redmi Game Bgmi works perfectly 60fps and 90fps Camera is awesome Battry last full day . For gaming 3 - 4 hour ' s 5g networks works perfectly in banglore downloading speed was 350 mbps and uploding speed is 150mbps . Network varies city to city .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Battry', 'positive']]
I needed a phone with buttery smooth performance with excellent power efficiency and a good battery life and I got it . Camera wasn ' t my concern as its camera is good enough for my purposes . And it has the best LCD screen I ' ve ever seen . And the sound is also good . With the 8 / 256 combo , I probably won ' t be having a need to replace it for the next 5 years . Also , love the phantom blue color . Dimensity 8100 is no joke . I am yet to experience heating outside of gaming . Even during gaming , the phone only gets warm and there ' s no throttling . The performance remains consistent even after several hours of gaming .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['LCD screen', 'positive'], ['Dimensity 8100', 'positive']]
Bought this almost a month ago , Got it for 15250 / - with exchange and cards . And I am absolutely satisfied with this phone . It is undoubtedly most powerful phone in this range . Camera is decent ( not the best ) . Beast performance and 3 . 5 mm jack available so its best for those who do gaming . Other day to day tasks run smoothly . Some bugs are in OS which can be fixed with updates . Screen is LCD but its good quality LCD with 144 hz refresh rate so it is overall decent although Amoled with 120 hz could have been better . Audio is good with dual stereo speakers present . Fingerprint sensor is quick . Battery backup is good and 67W charging is also fast enough . I am a heavy user and even for me it gives backup for whole day so Battery is overall very good . 4 . 5 / 5 phone . If performance matters for You . If camera is more important to you go for Realme 9 pro + 5g .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['OS', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'neutral'], ['Screen', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint sensor', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'positive'], ['67W charging', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]
Great Battery , Superb Performance , I mainly bought this phone for performance . No lag in PUBG , APEX LEGENDS , MLBB . As this is my primary phone now i use a lot of battery but still it runs smoothly for a day with a lot of battery to spare . I binge watch Netflix , Prime , Hotstar for 2 - 3 hours so battery is very good according to me . A lot of people are complaining about the camera but I don ' t get it , I am not very focused on camera but it gives decent pictures . Back main camera is more than enough for good photography , the front camera is not upto the mark that ' s true . The feel is not much premium because of the plastic back but you won ' t feel it . The screen is not AMOLED but I used to have super AMOLED and this screen is doing more than fine for me . I am ok with it . Decent colors and pictures .####[['Battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Back main camera', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['screen', 'positive']]
Using it for one month , good budget phone after exchange . Good for playing games and day to day uses , good battery life fast charge is awesome . Bought it for its processor thinking that all phone nowdays have storage expansion by SD card , none of the review had talked about no storage with SD card , so disappointed when I unboxed . Camera is average , back vibration with full volume . Just after setting up it updated to Android 13 with latest security patchs , good for day to dayuses and great for gaming , no heating observed till now . Full charge in 55min . Hoping to get some software updates to tune camera for optimal performance .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['fast charge', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral']]
The K50i is an excellent choice for those in the market for a smartphone under 25 , 000 rupees . Although its single - core performance is not as strong as the Snapdragon 870 but it compensates with fast multi - core performance . The camera is adequate , but not exceptional . With 12 5G bands , it offers comprehensive coverage of all 5G bands in India . The display is an IPS LCD screen , which is not as efficient with battery usage or color display as an AMOLED screen . The battery performance is satisfactory , but not outstanding . On the positive side , the phone charges quickly , taking just 40 minutes to go from 15 % to 85 % . The 144Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth user experience .####[['K50i', 'positive'], ['K50i', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['display', 'negative'], ['battery', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is good interms of performance and the fast charging . . I am writing this review after using it for 1month . . the isuue with phone is sometimes the application doesn ' t open at all . . And sometimes after opening anything app . Your touch doesn ' t work and says app isn ' t working . If these things are fixed by updating software to clear bug whatever then this phone is going to be superphone interms of performance####[['phone', 'positive'], ['charging', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Phone is good in looks has good quality case in box but when phone turned on the struggle starts there on first impression I started using Google Play Store it ' s big challenge for k50i to run Google Play Store smoothly screen falls black phone will hang it becomes unable to open recent tasks or new tasks it ' s even kills your recent tasks while only two apps are running one in front and one in background there is lots of tales of bugs in this phone only in the usage of two days and charging speed is good camera is also good display is also good .####[['k50i', 'positive'], ['k50i', 'negative'], ['charging speed', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]
I regret buying this device to be honest . Rear camera is average , front camera is below average ( photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better ) . Battery drains a lot even if you are not using the device , feels like 2 - 3k mah battery . Ram mangement is pathetic , can ' t even beat my 4 year old Samsung device with 4 gigs of ram . Device heats a lot when charging or doing normal tasks . The only good thing about this device is the perfomance . This will be my first and last Chinese phone .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['Rear camera', 'neutral'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Ram mangement', 'negative']]
Camera : Front camera is very bad both in low light and outdoor . Blurry image and too much blemished . Back camera has struggle with color accuracy . Battery : Average 1day lasting with moderate ussge . But charges fast . Performance : Very good . No hanging or lagging in gaming with high graphics . Display : If you have used AMOLED , this display might make you feel something off . Sound : Very good . Not impressed with the display and camera quality . I was a k20 pro user . Rest are good .

all the things are good , battery performance is very good it can last all day with your all day to day activities and gaming for 2 hour . camera performance is good in day but night photos are little noisy . processor is very well optimized and performance is very good . after 15 days of use i havent noticed major heating issue . slightly heats while gaming but it does not affect your gaming experience . brightness feels little less in day it could be higher . overall its very good budget phone####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery performance', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Battery drains very fast . Terrible battery performance not even last a day under average daily usage . I have faced a few lags and mild heating issues also under normal usage . Back Camera quality also not at all good under well lit conditions . After investing this much of amount for this flagship phone from Redmi , I am at a fix now . I don ' t recommend buying this one .####[['Battery', 'negative'], ['battery performance', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Back Camera', 'negative'], ['Redmi', 'negative']]
I changed my phone due to battery problem and i prefer k59i but this phone is not so gud at this price its battery drain so fast . Don ' t purchase it waste of money . Go for another device if you want to purchase up to ; 25000 . It 5080MAH battery works like a old mobile battery . Camera quality also not good . Pics are like oil painting . Old front camera . Touch is gud . Take more than 1 hour for charging . Don ' t purchase it if you going to change your mobile . I bought it on 03oct 22 from Amazon . A gud mobile can be purchased in this range from any brand . Chinese brand working like Chinese . Totally a bad choice . Fingerprint works gud . During writing this review battery has drained 2 % this is the quality of redmi and it ' s battery .

Don ' t buy this phone if you ' re looking for gaming . Despite having a powerful processor , it ' s unable to handle most games . RAM management is very bad , so much that even 2 apps wont stay in ram sometimes . Minor heating issues occur and constant lags while gaming . Games stutter randomly and frequently . Sometimes even crash and a message pops up " System UI not responding " . . . UI also has a lot of minor bugs which really degrades the user experience . Not at all recommended for heavy users .####[['processor', 'positive'], ['processor', 'negative'], ['RAM management', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['UI', 'negative']]
Not a good battery . Since am regular customer in redmi . Am not sure how come this product become worst in terms of battery . just 10days over to this phone and i visited to service center to check on this fault , they said no issue after keeping observation of 1day . But i could see same conditions as before . Now am frustrated on this phone to change this phone , I don ' t have replacement nor to change battery , Redmi has to understand this situation and request to come to me . Thanks####[['redmi', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative']]
Only thing good about this phone is it ' s battery which provides 6 hours of screen on time . Fingerprint sensor is not good , screen goes white most of time during calls . Dimensity 8100 Processor is overhyped not even close to snapdragon 855 . Phone lags most of the time while using . Everything from Speakers & mic to camera & touch are average . MiUi 13 is worst UI . If u are stock Android user then this redmi k50 i is definitely not recommended , lots of ads & bloatware . My 3 years old OnePlus 7 still works way better than redmi k50 i . Such a waste of 27k Rs .####[['Fingerprint sensor', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['redmi k50', 'negative'], ['Dimensity 8100 Processor', 'negative'], ['Speakers', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['touch', 'negative'], ['MiUi 13', 'negative'], ['mic', 'negative']]
Worst redmi phone I ever get camera quality is poor flashlight blinks before camera takes snaps camera didn ' t focus on subject and with flash light it takes blurr images . Very very poor for low light photography . Image processing is worst I have never seen a redmi phone with this poor camera performance before . . .

In half day of using the phone , the phone automatically starting rebooting on loop , it not a software problem more of it is like hardware or motherboard problem , there ' s no way i can stop restarting , the phone get very very hot like it can blast anytime , the screen is average LCD , the camera is just like a 10k phone just by giving a good processor it won ' t make any change , i just want refund .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['processor', 'positive']]

The phone is good . Battery life is excellent , in one charge the phone runs for approximately 24hours without any problem . Touch sensation is also amazing . Camera quality is average than other redmi phones of the same price . In daylight good pictures come but during night a bit blurry . Wifi connections is a bit poor and i have faced issues several time with the wifi connectivity of the phone . Sometimes the network itself goes down slowing work process but i expect that this issue will be solved once 5g is launched####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'positive'], ['Touch sensation', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Wifi connections', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
The phone is awesome ( in performance , battery , camera , almost everything ) . Don ' t understand why people have given negative reviews above . Has several pre - installed apps , but most of them can be uninstalled , which gives you a clean and clear UI . Network and battery performance is awesome . Camera is also good enough .

The battery life is excellent in this phone . 5000mah live up to the expectations . Bought it for my father and he is very happy with this phone .

I see a lot of experts comment here. They use this platform show their expertise. They compare it with a Nikon DSLR for camera, battery life with a car battery and display with that with a smart tv. Go for any mobile. Just see the features you need. A basic camera, reasonable 4000 to 6000 mAH battery. I have not found any such negativity described here. My mobiles last for more than 2 years irrespective of any brands.####[]
It is a regular phone . You don ' t expect smartphone experience in this phone . It ' s camera is not great . Front camera is bad . Ram management and battery performance is poor .

Wifi on this mobile is very weak . All other mobiles show good wifi signal however 11 prime shows good but connection speed is 1 to 6 Mbps . I am talking about 2 . 4 hz bandwith reception . I dont know if its a hardware issue or software , apps wont download & youtube wont play if you aren ' t sitting next to wifi . I was able to place a replacement order but the replacement handset also had same problem finally called amazon customer care and raised a return request . Its a standard procedure to first raise a replacement request and then a return request of the problem persists .

Lookwise good . But only lookwise . Sound quality not loud like other phones . Camera is pathetic . Not even class of 13mp . Fingerprint sensor set on start button .

Overall Phone performance is good , but there are many MI apps which you can ' t uninstall and those all default apps that used your mobile data quickly . The camera is mentioned 50 megapixels but it captures the photos in daylight very bad and not so clear , and night vision is even worst . seems like 5 - megapixel camera . MIUI is worst even that not allow us to hide apps in the drawer or not allow us to make folder groups of apps .

The quality of the power button is very poor . I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023 . When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device ( As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped , hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost . I told them that there was no crack on screen or dent on any other part of the phone and asked them to write in writing that they confirm that the phone was dropped . However the service centre refused warranty claim citing company policies .####[['power button', 'negative'], ['service centre', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'negative']]

Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal . Its buttery smooth , no lag what soever , camera is top notch like its top quality . I thought it would take time to get adjust to its OS but for me it was no problem . I thought I would miss many feature from android but tbh most of the androids features are gimmicky and I only ever miss multitasking from android . But then again I am going to a very budget phone so i dont really know the true extent of android flagship phone but then again if you are going to pay premium price for a phone why not a Iphone####[['iphone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['OS', 'positive'], ['OS', 'negative']]
As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say , iPhone is a good upgrade . I do , however , have some issues with the phone . If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues . As in , the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature . In the case of messages , you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option . Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone . I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls . Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e - sim , no dual tray for both your sim card . I am having issues with screencast / mirroring as well . In short , all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone . Other than that the phone is great . Camera is great with a lot of features ( which I’m still learning ) . Sound is great . No annoying nudges to keep updating apps . It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated . Easy to use once you get the hang of it .####[['iPhone', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera ( highly impressive video quality ) , battery life ( normal use - more than 10hrs , Gaming - 4 - 5hrs ) , performance ( best ) . But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge ( good factor - it takes 30mins for 50percent charge ) . Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming . writing this after 6months usage .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['charge', 'negative'], ['charge', 'positive']]
I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately . This phone is perfect for all , whatever you need you can get from this device . Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb . Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7 - 8hrs of backup . Build quality is superb . The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate , Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it , rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate . And guys i love the notch so sorry about it i can ' t comment on this .

It is an amazing phone , the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones , it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6 - 7 hours screen time which is decent ( depending upon how you wanna use your phone , i use mine primarily for work , emailing , googling , watching videos and all ) . The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow , this is my switch from android to ios for the first time , although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great , total value for money ( got it for 62k )####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos , just go for it . A15 bionic is super fast and it has amazing performance it is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user , but if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['A15 bionic', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative']]
I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed .

Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad ! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long , but games runs so smoothly ! Screen size is small , face id works perfect , No bugs ! Display quality is best , All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth , but its apple ( we shell not talk about worth of money ) Edited review After using it 2 months - : battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90 % and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30 % after 4 hours so battery is good enough… .

Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement . Android users may find the security annoying . . I did . . . . biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book . Audio ( Stereo ) quality is awesome for a phone . Battery will last 1 day for average users . . . . . jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks ( on Android ) is a bummer . . . . but security is security .

A good phone for which you might need to sell your kidney . Battery life is decent , user interface is same as of Android , camera quality is decent but if I am going to spend 70k on a phone for camera , I better spend it on a DSLR . Speakers are amazing and so is the display . Connectivity is superb and it is rough and tough but again with the Android user interface I think it is expensive .

I paid 73 , 000 for a phone but they don ' t give a charger ! Thats so cheap about apple . Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste . Good decision . If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger , then why they need to produce new phones in the first place ? To cut down waste and save environment , they can stop producing phone as well , right ? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention . My 2 stars is not for the phone , but for their cheap tactics to cheat people .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['Apple', 'negative']]

This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it . I thought the camera would be great , but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating . I bought it for Rs . 60 , 499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13 .

I bought this phone keeping in mind that apple phone has very powerful processor , but it looks like at this price I could have bought a better android phone . This iPhone 13 has very serious heating issues . Only after 15 minutes of gaming or video recording , the phone starts heating up to the point where it gets very uncomfortable to hold it . So please think before buying this phone . Total waste of money . Not worth the hype .####[['iPhone 13', 'negative']]
Thought that at least I phone won’t hang but it’s been only 1 month I bought it and it started hanging already and it’s been 3rd time in a month . Wasn’t able to access any app not even able to move between the screens . Ultimately I had to shut down my phone and restart it again . Then what difference iPhone made when compared to an android phone . Really pathetic , annoying and disgusting to experience this kind of things from an IPhone . Sheer waste of money and obviously not value for money . Would not recommend to anyone to buy such a bad product and waste their hard earned money####[['I phone', 'negative']]
Good quality . . The camera is also really good but could be improved . . The body of the mobile feels good and lightweight . . The display is great and sharp with good refresh rate .

These days phones are so much the same . The development of phones has reached a point of saturation and the kind of processor speeds these companies are providing we rarely use unless u r a gamer who require hard core specification .

I excitedly bought this phone along with a new Jio sim to finally harness 5G . I checked the factors of price , specifications , and so on to decide on a new phone , and this one was the clincher .

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given .

it is not worth for money .

Battery is a major set back , though it charges superfast but gets discharged also very superfast , even though there r no apps running in the background , i don ' t play games like free fire etc . , though it is a gaming phone still battery doesn ' t last even for 24 hrs .

Power and performance wise the device is a beast . However , I noticed very late that phone has light bleeding issue . In dark environment , the bleeding is clearly visible on black wallpaper .

Writing this review after 6 months of purchase . I dropped in water for less than a second . It turned off after that . Now it ' s repair cost is more than it ' s original cost - not covered by warranty . I have had other brands phones which got wet more than once but never got any problem . This was my worst experience . My 28k down to zero just in one second .####[['warranty', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
It was working fine till 6 months , since I did not update it when I update it lot more issue starting to show , it ' s being white background anytime for few seconds and battery drainage too quickly . I am regreting to purchase this phone####[['NULL', 'negative']]

The Phone Is Pretty Good , RAM Can Be Expanded Really Easily , Runs Very Smooth You Even Have An Option To Change Your Refresh Rate Camera Is Good Aswell But It Charges Really Slow So If You Put It On Charge Let It Charge For Atleast 1h 30 mins - 2h the battery last long pretty good aswell overall a good phone####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['RAM', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive']]
For sure that this device is ' value for money ' . But the specs are not of any use , it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range , but its of no use as graphics , screen refresh rate are not compatible , hence he ram is just kind of waste here . Camera quality is also poor , yes it ' s not upto the mark . You can avail this phone for normal use , but camera needs to be better . As its camera is also not upto mark , this device is not compatible to most people . It ' s a good low budget phone , but instead of RAM , the focus should have been on camera and screen refresh rate .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['ram', 'positive'], ['ram', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['screen refresh rate', 'negative'], ['graphics', 'negative']]

This phone is the most unstable one I have ever seen . The 5000 mAh battery drains too fast , the OS is quite fragile , device keeps on rebooting abruptly even after you have installed all the available updates .

Also touchscreen does not perform well .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'negative'], ['OS', 'negative'], ['touchscreen', 'negative']]
As soon as you start the phone it starts to hang . The HiOS sometimes stops working . The RAM is almost consumed upto 60 % when you start the phone for the first time . The refresh rate is hopeless . Extendable RAM is just a hoax , doesn ' t make any difference . Also when you open the package , you’ll be shocked to see that phone screen is not safely wrapped , so the screen might come with a few minor scratches####[['phone', 'negative'], ['HiOS', 'negative'], ['RAM', 'negative'], ['refresh rate', 'negative'], ['Extendable RAM', 'negative'], ['package', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for my elderly father . The overall view of the phone is excellent and that ' s it .

There are lots of negative reviews but this phone is overall a good phone .

I got this for 9k and for this price I think this is the most balanced phone .

Out of the box phone looks good , case provided + 1 . Screen looks decent . One factor making the experience bad is the time taken to charge the device . Exceptionally slow .

Did not expect this from Apple . Charging premium price which is very very unreasonable . Killing middle class by looting customers . Not worth the premium price they are charging . Phone is heating too much during charging , I have to keep it in Fridge for 10 minutes to cool it down . Also internet speed is not constant . It keeps dropping . With the same sim and same recharge plan , in Samsung mobile , internet speed is constant and working good .####[['Apple', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'negative']]
Product is extremely poor quality . Better to buy samsung . Much competitive and much better dispay and product quality . I do not belive now onward in iphone quality . Within a 20 days of purchase mobile displays is stop working . Display is not damaged at all and even mobile is not fall single time . Mobiles are not well tested for quality .####[['iphone', 'negative'], ['displays', 'negative']]
Too much price for the features . Camera is not good , especially potrait pictures are soo blur & low resolution in room light . Other brands offer much better cameras & zoom at this heavy price .

After using adroid phone the I phone is more slower than any Android phone . Picture quality not as expected . Some of the apps not working as in Android .

I was searching for a decent smartphone for very nominal usage and was not interested in going for high budget range and then I saw this phone . This has really good build quality and the touch finish also gives good on hand feel . I was amazed by the battery backup , it really goes for two days literally . Camera quality has got some compromise but can ' t expect more at this price range . Screen quality is also great .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'positive']]
This phone is decent enough as per its price point , it can be the best mean device for normal usage and for those who don ' t have anything much to do with high fi features . A simple device , and easy - to - go device .  Just the con is the huge battery size it has , it does not have a fast charging option hence it takes a little longer to fully charge . However , as I said if a user is a very simple user who has nothing to do much with haste can take good time to get charged . Since my mom is a homemaker as per her insights it is a decent choice .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative']]
Good mobile for the price . Display , sound , processor speed are good . No lag noticed .

The phone itself is good at this price bracket , but the front camera is the worst camera I have ever seen in an Android phone . It would be better for Samsung as an established brand to update it ' s 5 MP front camera which works as 0 . 3 MP VGA Camera . Rest is ok in this phone as promised and mentioned . The success of this phone could be ruined by only it ' s Front camera . Now a days everyone uses front camera for Video Calling via WhatsApp , Facebook or direct from Operator , and my personal experience is extremely bad for this particular phone .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]

I purchased this after doing some research according to my requirement . I knew I do not need to run high - end video or camera , 5G will take time to settle . It is as good as I expected .

The phone in itself is very well designed with a proper 3 - slot sim card tray and 4 cameras but the 2 mp macro lens does not produce good photos . The battery life is good and the screen is also quite good . Brightness is adequate and the charging for the phone is also fast . The phone can run cod at ultra but now the limit has been reduced .

Battery drains very fast even Im not a rough user . Camera quality feels much better . Maybe because my previous phone had less camera specs than this one .

I don ' t know how the makers manage to get so many good reviews , rather it should be mixed . The phone I purchased , it ' s only 15 days and the problem of ghost touch is occuring .

I removed all the cover and screen guard ( both company provided ) still the issue persists . Not even reboot button responds when this issue starts .

The charger doesn ' t work pretty well and only works fast charging less than half of the time . The UI is pretty lagging . The camera quality is below par .

I recommend this phone to people whose primary focus is not camera or speakers . . both of these are terrible on this phone , but always it ' s a trade - off at his price range .

What a good looking device it is . In hand feel very impressive you amazed by build quality . 48 mp camera take stunning picture . Snapdragon processor is too good in processing . Super smiled display is too good when you injoy media content . 5000 mah battery is enough for one day with heavy uses .

Is a great mid - range phone that offers solid performance and excellent camera quality . It has a display and a dual - lens camera that takes excellent photos in any lighting condition . It ' s also equipped with 5G connectivity and a long - lasting battery that can easily last all day . The only downside is that it lacks some of the high - end features found in more expensive phones .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['dual - lens camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Im curious about this phone before launch as redmi note 11 series were not that great but once 12 series were announced i was curious to know about this mobile and booked away on its 1st sale upto today this mobile performance has impressed me a lot , and camera was too good to say , and ads were reduced but it should be improved more####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'negative']]

Have been using this phone for the past 4 weeks . So far , the performance has been impressive in this price range . Battery backup is extremely good .

I have been using it for a month earlier than this using iPhone 11 . Its a expensive phone but doesn ' t have features and reliability like such .

Phone is good in terms of camera and day to day performance . But the network receiption has some issues . The network in phone disappears randomly sometimes even though in other phone the network strength is excellent and after couple of restart and network reset n sometimes reinserting sim , the signal comes back . Frequently happen when I use 5G . Not sure whether I got a defective piece or general problem in OnePlus 11R .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for having good snapdragon processor but it didn ' t met my expectations . People spends money on costly phone just for getting good performance and better camera , but don ' t expect much from this phone . Phone have network issue even after 5g , you get 4g network .

The battery life is disappointing . Even with moderate usage , the battery drains quickly and needs to be charged frequently . This can be a major inconvenience for anyone who relies on their phone for work or personal use . The build quality is not as good as previous models . The phone feels flimsy and fragile , and the back cover scratches easily . The fingerprint sensor is also unreliable and often fails to recognize my fingerprint . The price of the ONEPLUS 11R is not justified considering the subpar features and performance . There are many other smartphones in the market with similar or better features that are available at a lower price point .####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['ONEPLUS 11R', 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'negative']]

I have taken on last month phone usage was not satisfactory and display was too much delicate my elbow touched and it was broken I have never seen such delicate phone so I am not at all satisfied with the phone .

1 week later i recievdled the phone it fell from the bed . and the screen shattered . the screen alone is 28k . i called customer care and told how delicate the device is . he said sir the device should not fell in an angle it should fell on screen then it won ' t break . but god help them to understand accidents happens without telling you if the phone is dropping in angle or straight . i also requested oneplus to mention on thier website that you should not drop phone in an angle , drop it straight . in the end after 17 days of use i sold that device in 20k .####[['phone', 'negative']]
Worst phone quality ever . Phone was flickering earlier . And then suddenly whole phone is now green screen . Cannot do anything .

I am very happy and satisfied with this product . The touch and feel of the phone is nice and also the display is amazing .

It works seamlessly for all the application 3 . The camera is good if not best , since I am not much excited with the camera so this world quite well for me . 4 .

Terrific purchase at the price of 33k . Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also . Metallic sides could be a better option .

I did not face any heating issue in normal operations and light gaming ( 30mins ) of Vangaurd . The phone does not discharge fast of you fast charge that ' s just what it seems like , i do recommend turning off " rapid charge " .  The camera isn ' t bad .

All the features are average but the battery is the worst , it diffuses on such a pace that it ' s difficult for you to keep this mobile while you are traveling . All though it gets charged instantly that is one of the fastest i have seen till now . But it ' s reversely proportional .

Believe me the cameras are useless ! Don’t get biased by seeing many reviews here ( I think most are paid ) . Me myself ordered this phone and had to return this at any cost . I may not take this phone even this costs at 20k .  About speaker quality , let me explain , thankgod I found an issue , and the item got returned . DONT MAKE MISTAKE ! Speakers sounds good and loud too BUT , when you increase the volume , the back of the phone tremendously vibrates and you start feel irritating .  So , If anyone buying this and has a requirement of camera and speaker , you shouldn’t opt this ! Believe me , It won’t solve your minor requirement too ! !####[['cameras', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['speaker quality', 'negative'], ['Speakers', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'negative']]
Looks ordinary , feels ordinary , both front and back camera are okayish . I don ' t know why people hyped one plus camera so much . I ' d pay max 12k to 15k for this handset . Plus it ' s huge , feels like you ' ve held a tab in hand . It ' s huge and thick , it has all the thickness for earphone jack but doesn ' t have one . If you ' ve used pixel 4a kinda phones this handset feels like garbage in hand . It is only good to binge Netflix due to good battery back up and huge screen . Not buying one plus ever again .

After 15 days of use , I must say , this one is worth ! Nice speed and great performance ! They have given android 13 and it ' s a Jan 23 make ! Camera quality seems good and switching between the apps is also fast ! The audio jack is absent , but they have not made it slimmer ; hence , I feel , they should have given one . But as it ' s the flagship phone , it lacks the jack by default I guess . . It ' s a proposed water proof phone - so it ' s a good news ! It has wireless power sharing and it works . Battery lasts satisfactorily with a few settings . As of now , it ' s giving me more than 2 days !

On a scale of 1 to 5 , no matter which aspect you concentrate , a minimum rating of 3 . 8 and up to 5 can be given . Camera is superb . Not for a hard - core gamer but best for a casual gamer , have been getting no lag gameplay for pubg at medium graphics and extreme framerate ( medium graphics are enough for me ) . Been using it for 5 months and no issues so far what so ever . Amoled screen did not disappoint , it has been a great experience . Unexpected surprise was that the speakers are pretty good . Secure folder feature has been good for mirror apps .

A flagship phone by Samsung would never disappoint . Same is the case with S20 FE 5G . Noth me and wife use this model and are happy with the overall performance . I would not compare with either iPhone or Chinese manufacturers as Samsung has it ' s own class .

Good in this price range with this kind of OS nd samsung branding along with a good processor too , bundled with a charger surprisingly , in short I would say a decent phone in this range , even providing many flagship features like wireless charging nd reverse wireless charging , good camera quality in day light , but average display in bright sunlight , hardly 404 nits brightness , 120hz refresh rate is amazing , video quality in uhd 60fps is magic , amazing sound quality with Dolby Atmos , but am missing that headphone jack , great to see ip68 rating in this range . In short good to purchase within 30000 but not worth more than that , as competition is very high nd market is vast .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['sound', 'positive']]
The temple of tge device gets high after some time it is not for gamming if you are buying yhis phone for gamming please don ' t fo it and the battery life is also not so great for gamming this phone has good performance and overall it is a great device comes with a hood features if samsung provide 25watt charger instead of 15 watt it would be great cause the batter is already 45000 mah so they should atleast provide a 25 watt charger it supports fast charging as well as super fast charging the face recognizationn is also weak it does and work quickly I feel little regret but the camera is awsome I would like to go ahead and having plans of purchasing 100x zoom samsung device with a great performance if youll have any queries dm me on my ig : meraj _ n _ I would like to help####[['phone', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['batter', 'negative'], ['face recognizationn', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive']]

Hi , I am using this phone from almost 3 Months . Earlier i was having Samsung M51 which was awsome in terms of battery and camera . Samsung S30 is a good phone in terms of quality but very very poor battery and average camera . This phones hanges some time . It should have dedicated memory card , space is limited . I will not recomend this phone .####[['Samsung S30', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['Samsung S30', 'negative'], ['space', 'negative']]

I was very happy with my purchase and fell so in love with the device that I even plunged into galaxy system eco - system and bought galaxy watch and wireless charger etc .  When all was going good , the phone display stopped working for no reason as I was scrolling thru the gallery images . The phone just blacked out on me . I was then travelling with wife and kid in a different state , and all my documents , tickets , receipt , contacts were saved in digital form in my phone . I was totally clueless what happened and how am I going to revive the display so that I can continue with my tour . Fortunately I forwarded all the tickets and Receipts to my wife ' s mobile and my galaxy watch had all my contact synced .  2 star for the samsung customer care for replacing the display in a day , being a premium customer .####[['display', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['samsung customer care', 'positive']]
I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one . Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE . Used it for 2 - 3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least : ) . I had my personal data and office apps on it . 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work . had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app , contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it .####[['Samsung Galaxy 20 FE', 'negative'], ['display', 'negative']]
Bought in Jun 2022 , delivered on 25th Jun , I find this hardware button to be broken / disassociated on Nov 5 , 2022 . Lucky for me , the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello - tape and sort of fix it ( jugaad ) . However , this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore . The quality is deteriorating . BTW , the phone never fell from my hand , had a protector almost immediately . Now of course , Samsung will claim I ( or my kids , or somebody else ) MUST have dropped it . I have spent too much of time setting this up , and I can ' t give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience .####[['hardware button', 'negative'], ['Samsung', 'negative']]
The product seems to have a very common display Blackout issue requiring the display and battery to be changed . . . luckily for me it happened during warranty . . . then realised after searching for the issue online that for S20 FE it ' s a very common issue apparently for products sold during last great Indian festival sale . . . where in some cases Samsung had issued DOA and provided replacement . . . given that it ' s a known product issue on one of their galaxy series would have expected Samsung to have it resolved rather than causing inconvenience to customers buying their products####[['display', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['S20 FE', 'negative']]
I am a big fan of Samsung mobile but this model utterly disappointed me . 1 . Battery life is not acceptable need to charge twice a day and also charging is too slow . I have another Samsung phone having 6000 mah battery it charges faster than this 4500 mah 2 . Signal and connectivity issues are there . I have tested my sim in other make mobile I would easily get 4 to 5 Mbps speed but in Samsung only 900 Kbps was max at that particular location . Being a 5 G phone this is what not expected . 3 . In display finger scanner is too slow and most of the time you need to scan for 2 to 3 times . 5 लोगों को यह उपयोगी लगा####[['Samsung mobile', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'negative'], ['Signal and connectivity', 'negative'], ['In display finger scanner', 'negative']]
Shame on samsung for this product . I am using samung from last 10 years . But this product is worst than worst . It ' s battery life is like hell . Battery life drain like storm . Other features are OK but what about battery life . It ' s like you have good food to eat but don ' t have hand to taste . Very much disappointed by this . If you have more than 3 hrs daily use , don ' t go for it .

Just awesome . . the phone is rightly sized and absolutely mind blowing camera . I have used iPhoneX as well but feel this one comes close in terms of camera & stands out because of its price value .

Very good quality phone . But unfortunately phone started malfunctioning from 3rd of September . Charging port was not working . Eventually gave phone to Samsung service centre on 4th evening . As per them charging port needs to be replaced . Really disappointed with Amazon & Samsung . If a new flagship phone performs in this way how could we trust the brand . I don’t want to write anything negative , just a request please check quality of every product before selling . Presently my new phone is in service centre . Hopefully problem will be fix by them . Let see . Otherwise I need to contact with Amazon & Samsung for the solution .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Charging port', 'negative'], ['Amazon', 'negative'], ['Samsung', 'negative']]

First when I ordered this phone I was not sure about it . I had read a lot of reviews on the product and the seller found many negative reviews .

I have used it for only a week and returned it because of the reasons I felt like it has not satisfactory for the amount I payed . Display is gorgeous . . finger print reader and face recognition are fast enough . But my main reason to return is because of battery . . I was gettig only 3 and half hours of screen time which is rediculous . . I know that it will take some time to get used to my usage patterns but I don ' t know for sure it will get any better . . anyway switching to one plus seven pro . . .####[['NULL', 'negative'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['finger print reader', 'positive'], ['face recognition', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative']]

Its a nice phones does everything a flagship is supposed to do .

Also the phone is getting heated up while watching videos . Hope a software update comes soon .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'negative']]
Why does samsung stick to exynos processors for its flag ship phones beats me . Qualcomm processors perform better , photos are better . finger print scanner sucks badly and even after a update at the samsung center , it doesn ' t work properly . photos are a big let down and night time pics are hopeless and so are the low light pics . Even day time pics are grainy especially when you crop the pics 1 : 1 . Battery doesn ' t let you down for a day with controlled usage . Overall not a good phone . Leaves you with a feeling wanting for more .####[['exynos processors', 'negative'], ['finger print scanner', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]

The phone keeps heating up for now reason ! It ' s a brand new phone I received today . Whether I am keeping it on charging , or updating my phone apps , or just browsing my phone , the phone starts to heat up quite evidently in 10 - 15 minutes ! That stops me from using my phone for anything !####[['phone', 'negative']]
Phone ' s battery was not at all charged when received , so I put it on charging . After charging , phone was switched on and started software updates . Then I noticed that back panel has started coming off . You can in the attached images and videos that phone ' s back panel is coming out , and pasting glue is visible also . This must be due to battery overheating and swallowing . This is an horrible experience . After paying premium price for dated model still getting defective piece is an nightmare . On top of that product is not refundable . I raised return request , Amazon says the engineer will visit to inspect first . God know what will happen . Big money seems wasted .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['Amazon', 'negative']]
If you are using your mobile for phone call or just 5 - 10 photos at a time then only go for this mobile . Otherwise the worst mobile available at this price range . Camera quality at good sunlight is excellent . But images taken without sunlight is worst than some other low budget phone . . If you install some applications or watch some videos on internet for 10 mins then you can use mobile to iron box . Battery will drain so fast . But fast charging is okay . It will change fast . It will take around 1 . 30 hr for 60 - 70 % charge . There is not much lagging as if no . . But in my humble opinion never go for this phone . S10 . May be some other variant might be good .####[['mobile', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'neutral']]
I opened the package about 5 mins back and it has heated up terribly .

1st couple of months everything was good . Now mobile network is not working good . Phone is heating up quite often . Night photos are almost close to worst .

This is basically a Android Go edition phone which has a bigger screen , and a Decent processor . This is not a phone to expect a gaming experience but still can play games like Subway Surfers .

Phone is good , but not excellent . I bought a low cost phone as i keep breaking phones . Although this says 4gb Ram , 64 GB storage , latest processor etc . This phone lacks lot of options that were available in the phone i had bought 3 years ago . Its probably good for people who dont use phone as their daily necessity to work , compute , record and depend . The battery is 5k MAH , but doesnt last more than a day . no short cuts available for screen shot , flash light , calculator , speed ram , clean up . There is no option for widgets too that i needed badly on my phones . Anyways , as said its a basic phone and the color and screen size is good .

I regret buying this device to be honest . Rear camera is average , front camera is below average ( photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better ) .

Only thing good about this phone is it ' s battery which provides 6 hours of screen on time . Fingerprint sensor is not good , screen goes white most of time during calls .

The quality of the power button is very poor . I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023 . When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device ( As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped , hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost .

As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say , iPhone is a good upgrade . I do , however , have some issues with the phone . If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues . As in , the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature . In the case of messages , you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option . Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone . I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls . Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e - sim , no dual tray for both your sim card . I am having issues with screencast / mirroring as well . In short , all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone . Other than that the phone is great . Camera is great with a lot of features ( which I’m still learning ) . Sound is great . No annoying nudges to keep updating apps . It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated . Easy to use once you get the hang of it .####[['iPhone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera ( highly impressive video quality ) , battery life ( normal use - more than 10hrs , Gaming - 4 - 5hrs ) , performance ( best ) . But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge ( good factor - it takes 30mins for 50percent charge ) .

I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately . This phone is perfect for all , whatever you need you can get from this device . Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb . Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7 - 8hrs of backup . Build quality is superb . The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate , Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it , rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate . And guys i love the notch so sorry about it i can ' t comment on this . Thanks####[['phone', 'positive'], ['chip', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['refresh rate ', 'neutral']]
It is an amazing phone , the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones , it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6 - 7 hours screen time which is decent ( depending upon how you wanna use your phone , i use mine primarily for work , emailing , googling , watching videos and all ) . The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow , this is my switch from android to ios for the first time , although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great , total value for money ( got it for 62k )####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'positive']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos , just go for it . A15 bionic is super fast and it has amazing performance it is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user , but if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge .####[['A15 bionic', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed . Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative']]
Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad ! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long , but games runs so smoothly ! Screen size is small , face id works perfect , No bugs ! Display quality is best , All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth , but its apple ( we shell not talk about worth of money ) Edited review After using it 2 months - : battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90 % and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30 % after 4 hours so battery is good enough… . And you will love how COD runs smoothly ! ! i love it . . worth of money🫡####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['face id', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'negative']]
Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement . Android users may find the security annoying . . I did . . . . biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book . Audio ( Stereo ) quality is awesome for a phone . Battery will last 1 day for average users . . . . . jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks ( on Android ) is a bummer . . . . but security is security . No 4k for cinematic . . . .####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['Audio ( Stereo', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
A good phone for which you might need to sell your kidney . Battery life is decent , user interface is same as of Android , camera quality is decent but if I am going to spend 70k on a phone for camera , I better spend it on a DSLR . Speakers are amazing and so is the display . Connectivity is superb and it is rough and tough but again with the Android user interface I think it is expensive . I can provide you contact if you want to sell you kidney in black , as I sold mine to buy this .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]

I paid 73 , 000 for a phone but they don ' t give a charger ! Thats so cheap about apple . Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste . Good decision . If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger , then why they need to produce new phones in the first place ? To cut down waste and save environment , they can stop producing phone as well , right ? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention . My 2 stars is not for the phone , but for their cheap tactics to cheat people .####[['apple', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Applications crash very frequently . The phone heats up specially outdoors . Call conference has stopped working . Touch is not proper , many time touch screen doesn’t acknowledge my touch .

"I never thought that I would receive such a bad iPhone from Amazon when I ordered it online . My iPhone is taking extremely blurry photos and it heats up quickly , within 10 minutes of using Instagram or snap . when I called customer service for a replacement , they refused to exchange it directly . This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it . I thought the camera would be great , but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating . I bought it for Rs . 60 , 499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13 .

I bought this phone keeping in mind that apple phone has very powerful processor , but it looks like at this price I could have bought a better android phone . This iPhone 13 has very serious heating issues . Only after 15 minutes of gaming or video recording , the phone starts heating up to the point where it gets very uncomfortable to hold it . So please think before buying this phone . Total waste of money . Not worth the hype .####[['iPhone 13', 'negative']]
Thought that at least I phone won’t hang but it’s been only 1 month I bought it and it started hanging already and it’s been 3rd time in a month . Wasn’t able to access any app not even able to move between the screens . Ultimately I had to shut down my phone and restart it again . Then what difference iPhone made when compared to an android phone . Really pathetic , annoying and disgusting to experience this kind of things from an IPhone . Sheer waste of money and obviously not value for money . Would not recommend to anyone to buy such a bad product and waste their hard earned money####[['phone', 'negative']]
Good quality . . The camera is also really good but could be improved . . The body of the mobile feels good and lightweight . . The display is great and sharp with good refresh rate . Also I like the new breathing light around the camera , which makes it feel like the feature we like about the " nothing phone 1 " like it glows when someone calls , get notification , whole charging etc . and it is customisable .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['breathing light', 'positive']]
I really like this product . Video capturing quality is the best . The sound - recording quality is fantastic . Mostly at night photo quality is better than the other handsets .

These days phones are so much the same . The development of phones has reached a point of saturation and the kind of processor speeds these companies are providing we rarely use unless u r a gamer who require hard core specification . A good phone like other oppo devices and the led around camera looks cool . Overall a nice design gifted it to my wife she liked it . More of a phone for casual use .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]
I excitedly bought this phone along with a new Jio sim to finally harness 5G . I checked the factors of price , specifications , and so on to decide on a new phone , and this one was the clincher . It is overall a fine smartphone . My friends had lots of good things to say about it . I personally love its battery life .  I had a little bad experience with gaming with it though . . . I was playing Efootball 23 and the operations in - match weren ' t working at all . It was frustrating . The gameplay is smooth , but sometimes things get thwarted .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'neutral']]
I have a very low opinion on Indian products due to the quality standards but this phone beats my opinion . Looks very premium and slim . The phone comes with 4 GB and 6 GB RAM , I would suggest to go for 6 GB RAM as it can process more information at much faster rate without any heating issues . Initially I bought the one with 4 GB RAM and I returned it due to its heating issues####[['phone', 'positive'], ['6 GB RAM', 'positive'], ['4 GB RAM', 'negative']]
The battery backup , performance and battery are best part . I ' m using this from about 2 months no problem is found and it is fully made in india . So if you are thinking to buy another phones like poco , infinix , redmi etc . You must give a try to lava it is better than them . you also get free home service if you found any error in lava .

Budget 5g phone with dual sim 5g standby excellent camera but only limitation is 5g carrier aggregation not working and 4g carrier aggregation is working only on band 1 + band 3 and band 1 + band 41 .

This isn ' t paid review , it is my honest answer . . . I ' ve bought two phones with same configuration of 6GB RAM and 128GB internal . The best part of the phone is completely Indian , so you won ' t regret after purchasing it plus if any problem comes there is home service available , it is the best phone in this price range . . At least better than other devices of Chinese phones . My both sisters are super happy . . Thank You Lava , just a small request work continuously on your R & D and software updates .####[['Lava', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Best phone in this range with 128 GB memory and the phone is smooth and fast . Also the phone is cool and never heats up . Also good battery life and all features are up to date and good .

I am writing this review after a month of use . Lava made an good attempt to make Desi 5G phone . But they need to improve it in terms of speed and performance . But it ' s definitely a good 5G phone at this price . Design is superb , but speed of the phone is not upto 5G expectation . Camera is good I can say . Sometimes getting stuck n not getting calls but Truecaller showing notification of incoming call . Overall above average performance .####[['speed', 'negative'], ['performance', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive']]
Let me start this review by talking about the battery , which is the main aspect of this device . Despite taking a bit longer than usual to charge , this monstrous 5000 - mah battery proves that it is a Nokia in disguise . The camera quality is good in UHD mode , the only mode I recommend . When it comes to performance , being awestruck is inevitable , as this is the epitome of software optimization . But too much multitasking slows down the device , which is normal for a device that boasts only 6GB of RAM . This device ' s HD + IPS display and an impressive speaker will let us zone out of our surroundings and plunge into the world of never - ending bliss . The benefits we get from this device are unbelievable for the price we are paying . You will never regret this purchase unless you are in the chase for the posh .####[['battery', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['software', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'positive'], ['device', 'positive']]
I used it for 5 days , , lookwise , phone is best , good phone in this range , but , as part of 5G connectivity , it is more disappointed me it ' s wifi . 5G works only through sim , but it ' s wifi band is 4G , not 5G . if u connect it ' s wifi with 5G router or 5g hotspot it ' s speed is slower than 4g . Refresh rate is not to good as 90 hz . , screencast is given on slides bar but it is disabled & not works , either not connecting tv if u use any other app from playstore .

I bought this LAVA phone hoping for quality and features , but I lost interest as soon as I held it .  1 . This product is overpriced for its quality . A fair price would be 6k or 7k for this quality . 2 . I liked the idea of Clean Android ( No Bloatware ) , but I was surprised that there was no gallery app . I could only view my photos and videos in google photos , which I did not like . The camera quality was also poor . 3 . The refresh rate is unsatisfactory . It leads to jerky and sluggish movement when I browse or slide .  Disappoint with the Indian phone . Hope they get better or if they want to continue , please sell it at lesser price .####[['LAVA phone', 'negative'], ['Android', 'positive'], ['Android', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['refresh rate', 'negative']]

इसके जैसा घटिया फोन मैंने पूरे जीवन में नहीं देखा। ये सोचके फोन लिया कि भारतीय कंपनी है और इतनी कम कीमत में कुछ अच्छा ही दिया होगा लेकिन पैसे बर्बाद। इसमें इंटरनेट की स्पीड ना के बराबर है। कुछ भी प्ले करो वो बीच में ही बंद हो जाता है। ना तो डाउनलोड होता है ना ही कोई गाना या स्टोरी सुन पाता हूं परेशान हो गया हूं। बाकी चीजें ठीक हैं लेकिन यदि नेट ही सही से ना चले तो बाकी फीचर का क्या अचार डालूंगा। बिना नेट के तो मोबाइल कचरा ही होता है।####[['फोन', 'negative']]

Light weight , sleek awesome samsung galaxy note . Awesome display , outstanding camera , s pen with sleek handset is very and unique and probably this is the last phone released which is both light weighted as well as s - pen note features .

Samsung Note 10 is epic device offering premium experience . However , necessary accessories to upgrade the phone to that feel are to be purchased additionally which come at a steep premium . For example , the clear back cover bundled with phone once replaced with LED flip case or Clear Display flip cover transforms the handling experience . Absence of 3 . 5 mm audio port is disappointing . It appears to be a strategic move from manufacturers to lure users buy additional gadgets like wireless earbuds ! Many of useful accessories are still not available in India . USB type - C to 3 . 5 mm audio port adapter is yet to be released . 45W Fast Charger is not bundled in phone box and still not available in markets even after three months of launch of Note 10 series . Wireless charger / power bank purchased separately from Samsung is also disappointing as it heats up while charging and drains in no time . Apart from few of these accessories related cons , Note 10 experience is super fantastic and hopefully will last long .####[['Samsung Note 10', 'positive'], ['3 . 5 mm audio port', 'negative'], ['accessories', 'negative'], ['USB type - C', 'negative'], ['3 . 5 mm audio port adapter', 'negative'], ['45W Fast Charger', 'negative'], ['Samsung Note 10', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]

I got this phone from Amazon for 50 k in Dec 2020 . . If i bought it at its original price , seriously this would have been a downer for me . . This phone is good ( despite lower screen size ) preferred this one of 10 + series . The best feature is its form factor and display . But if I do a comparison with my sister ' s phone ( one plus 7T pro ) , the battery is an area samsung seriously need to look at . The screen display is awesome and hence would need a minimum 4000 mah and this is really irritating since even without much use , my phone needs charging in 5 hours . Moreover given its refresh speed rate , I expect issues of lag in the future . But for me the battery is seriously something Samsung sucks at .####[['Amazon', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative']]

I have been using this phone for two months . According to the price range , the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good . According to this range , the camera is also fine .

I bought this for office use . Has good battery life . And basic features of android work fine . However , I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition . I don ' t mind using it .

Writing this review after 24 hours of rigorous usage . Got the phone delivered yesterday . Phone is good for a low end use . You can definitely purchase it in case you want to use it as a backup phone . To be honest , I have purchased for the same reason . Phone is over all good . Yeah , it lags a little . Also , the video quality is not that good , but definitely you can use it for a temporary watching . Overall picture quality is satisfactory . The only major issue that I have faced is that while making any of the WhatsApp , Viber calls , the voice comes from the top speakers instead of the earpiece so it might be an issue in case if you want to talk something personal in a public place .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'negative'], ['video', 'negative'], ['picture', 'negative'], ['earpiece', 'negative']]
This device is good for them who are looking for a cheap secondary device . At this price , it is a good option can ' t complain but Xiaomi could have given the Helio p35 instead of four years old slow Helio A22 . The Miui - launcher Go crashing like hell .

I bought this phone for my parents , and they loved it as they use it only to make calls and use social media , which do not require a lot of RAM .

I ordered it as I am a light user . I only use Chrome , YT , WhatsApp , Zee5 . For these apps 2GB Ram is enough . I have been using those apps in Samsung On5 1 . 5 GB Ram since 2016 , that too smoothly . But this phone may have some manufacturing issues I guess . This phone seems slow even in normal usage , forget the heavy usage , time lag in every action you do . Tap on any app icon , be it Chrome or YT , never opened immediately . Bit problem with Haptic feedback too . Moreover , you can ' t install full version Amazon app in in this phone , only a light version is supported which is less than 1 MB runs through Chrome . You can not use " Chat Right Now " feature of Amazon in light version .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['app', 'negative'], ['Haptic', 'negative']]
I wanted a cheap phone as temporary basic , im not Android user for long and so did not like a lot of thing . Performance - it ' s slow like what you get with 2 gb ram , but not lagging playing YouTube or Spotify . I don ' t expect to perform this phone great so I ' m neither disappointed . It has a large screen and it ' s not bad at all , I would be happier to see a smaller screen though . Camera , unsure why it has 2 camera and what they do , let ' s not use the camer ! It ' s just a basic camera that capture photos if there ' s lot of light and the object dont move Battery is decent , actually there ' s nothing much I can do with this phone to drain the battery It dose make decent call .####[['Performance', 'negative'], ['Performance', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['call', 'positive']]
Overall okay , but very dissatisfied with speakers . I placed on full volume , but am barely able to hear videos from Youtube , etc . Also , the sound quality during phone calls is muffled .

Otherwise , okay for a budget starter phone .####[['speakers', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Phone is very slow , very hard to run even one app like YouTube . I bought it for my father just to see some videos in YouTube in his free time , but it ' s very slow .

The battery is said to be 5000mah , however it must be of such a poor quality that it starts degenerating exponentially after the first use . RAM is much lesser than what is promised in the description which causes the mobile phone to glitch consistently . Image / photo quality is extremely poor . Much more advanced mobile phones are being produced by other companies and are being sold for roughly the same price as this one .####[['battery', 'negative'], ['RAM', 'negative'], ['Image / photo', 'negative']]
Do not buy this phone , keeps on hanging and you can ' t run YouTube in it . Not you can make calls properly . It will close apps automatically .

It ' s a perfect set for travellers and a person who all are working till late hours as it ' s battery life is great and in another hand it ' s picture quality is very good even with a low light and front is places just at the centre which makes comfortable at the time of video chat / conference in my opinion it ' s a perfect phone for all####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['picture', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Its value for money for sure . To be honest I am not a person who likes to play games on phone . Lets be serious , for that we have PS . Isn ' t it .

I have attached few images . For me Hands down , VALUE FOR MONEY .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive']]
Except for 90 hz display this phone is a beast . For camera , it can beat any other smartphone out in the market . It has a video bokeh which works very well and optical image stabilization .

I ' ve using it since 2 years now and I ' m happy with the purchase . At first didn ' t want to buy it but I needed a good camera phone and I ' m glad I chose it .

And backup is also long throughout day . Sound video everything is great . Would recommend to buy . And not a paid review but yeah really happy with phone . I bought it for 32k now price is less .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'positive'], ['video', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Most awesome and monster product . . . . Just it has a battery life issue but the charging speed will staisfy you . . The proccessor is so cool that while playing BGMI it gives a nice and smooth gameplay . The camera is so cool that at night without activating Night mode it gives awsome photos . If you want a long lasting and performance packed smartphone you can go with this smartphone . .####[['smartphone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['proccessor', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]
I was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all , but for 28k , this is one of the best phones in the segment .  I had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options . Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects , the performance , the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible . Also Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it ' s a plus point .  The only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz . It starts to act as it lowers to 30 , 40 fps or something . And the battery life is average . It ' s 1 charge in the evening for sure . But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough . I use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style . Recommended to all .####[['SD 888', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['gaming features', 'positive'], ['charger', 'positive'], ['battery', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['60Hz', 'negative']]
The value for money of this product at a price of 26k is really good . Although I exchanged my old smartphone to get to this price point but even if it retails for 28k or 29k it is hands down the best smartphone to go for but if your top priority is user experience you should rather go for nothing phone 1####[['smartphone', 'positive']]
The phone ticks all the right boxes in all the categories . like good camera , decent battery life , good in hand feel . Phone looks little big , but you wont have any issue while handling it . overall i would say , its the best phone at 26K . Just go for it , you wont regret .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'neutral'], ['battery life', 'positive']]
The Funtouch OS is perfectly optimised with Google . Camera Quality is one of the best both rear and front . There are various modes available to capture pictures . Night Vision is the best thing . It doesn ' t boost images and the AI is much better . Gaming experience is also better . Smoother frames , no excessive heating Battery lasts almost entire day . Around 5 . 5 - 6hrs of screen time if fully charged . Charging is the fastest . Takes around 35 - 40 mins for 0 to100 percent charge . Processor and all other aspects are upto the expectation mark .####[['Funtouch OS', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Processor', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Idk why people give 1 2 stars complaining the battery life , maybe they dont have life outside mobile . The phone is literally good in all aspects , never expected such a beautiful camera , ordered for performance but the cam was deadly both front and back . Battery life is good too . 4 - 5hrs of PUBG and 8hrs of normal use its good . Like if you are an addict please change the lifestyle , have life outside phone . Everything is good from the OS to foot . And heating issue is that use in room temp or outside conditions its good otherwise it does heat a bit with 888 processor . But if you want both camera and performance its great . No lag in PUBG hotdrop bootcamp with recording . Remove bloatware and customize to your comfort . This phone rocks !####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'positive'], ['OS', 'positive'], ['888 processor', 'negative'], ['performance', 'positive'], ['888 processor', 'positive']]
So let ' s start with performance I get stable 60 fps on Apex legends and CODm and in fight it drops to 57 - 60fps . The camera is very good at this price segment even better than One plus 9RT . The battery drains a little fast but it with updates it would be fixed most probably . Also the battery performance doesn ' t bother me much . Since I use the phone it drops to 40 and in 20mins it ' s full charged . 0 - 100 takes 35 - 40 minutes .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
Firstly I want to confess that Iqoo 9 se is Best processor in low budget . . It is an Flagship Phone So Easily you can use it for more than 3 years . Back Camera is Quite Good but front is Ok not bad you can Ok with it . Battery is too Awesome you can easily used it for whole day . They are Providing you 65 watt changer So you can get full in just 30 mins . Display is tooo tooo good You feel like awesome by using it and it not affect your eyes as well . Sensors are too good Finally I can say that buy a Iqoo 9se is quite better than Banded Flagship Phone####[['Back Camera', 'positive'], ['front', 'neutral'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['Iqoo 9', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['65 watt changer', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Sensors', 'positive']]
I Gifted this phone to myself on my birthday on 15 Aug 2022 . Really awesome phone , Battery drianed fast during installation of apps and restoration of data however was amazed by the charging time , it just took 20 minutes to charge the battery from 0 to 80 % . Touch is working very well , Shifted from Samsung to Iqoo hence you will feel slight difference in brightness . Didn ' t feel heating issue . BGMI is working smooth . Camera quality is good . I was initially in dilemma wheather to buy a Non branded phone or not , but due to flagship features Iqoo is offering at lower price I went ahead and bought it . Really happy with the product . This phone has exceeded my expectations .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Touch', 'positive']]
Using this phone for 4 days now and it ' s performance is top notch . Haven ' t faced any heating issues as of now . Not even during game play . It gets slight heated but cool down even faster . Battery could have been a bit better . Not disappointing though . Giving me enough juice for a day . Charging speed is very good which kind of compensates for the battery backup . Camera is decent . Haven ' t tested it to the limit . Design and in hand feel is excellent . Doesn ' t feel heavy . Display is just amazing . Dual stereo speakers could have been louder . But they are decent . If you have a budget of 30 - 35k , go for it . If you are a gamer , you ' ll have fun .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Design', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Dual stereo speakers', 'negative'], ['Dual stereo speakers', 'neutral']]
If you want to grab the beauty of android then you have to have a powerful phone otherwise same lag , slow applications opening will be there for you . But here with this one u will have a beast in your hand , dont go with the statement that 888 heats a lot , because here you won ' t find any heating issue , normal heating is there for every smartphone . Display of this device is awesome , I mean you can comoare it with some flagships of Samsung also . Camera quality is more than average but it can be improved through OTA updates . Overall definitely you can have this one and u won ' t regret it .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['applications', 'negative'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Camera quality', 'positive']]

I am using this device since a week feels buttery smooth and also have lot of customisation options for display and lot of settings according to your need .

I bought this phone it ' s an excellent phone but for the gaming experience I would deduct one star , if the company in future make an update of better gaming may be it would be good for gaming but for now it doesn ' t support 90 Fps in bgmi and has heating and frame dropping proplems . . I don ' t know from wich side it is , iqoo says it ' s from game side and bgmi says it ' s from your device side . . . I don ' t know but i hope in future it would be solved . . .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Good display , good sound although sound is not much loud but have a sweet bass , smooth experience , camera good but front video could be given 60 fps , good haptic , every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better .

The phone is good and okay for the price it offers . Rear camera has is okay just as we see in vivo phones and gives pictures with true colour , sometimes the background such as blue sky or light colours tend to appear white If u use AI . Selfies are bit grainy but its okay . The 888 SoC is okay but it is no where near 8 Gen 1 . The games lags at full definition . Multi tasking is sometimes sluggish showing loading for fraction of seconds . Overall good but if u can strech the budget go for 8gen 1 +####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Rear camera', 'positive'], ['Rear camera', 'negative'], ['Selfies', 'neutral'], ['888 SoC', 'positive'], ['888 SoC', 'negative']]
Every thing is nice the best phone in the given price bracket but th only problem is battery life . It takes only 6 to 7 hrs to drain if continuous gaming is done . Otherwise it is nice can last upto 1 and a half day . But if you consider the fast charging which actually charges the phone In less than 30 mins it sums up for that given disadvantage . Funtouch os 13 is also very smooth and gives a stock android feel .####[['battery life', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Funtouch os 13', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Before buying this phone , i researched about this phone a lot . Now after a two week of usage of this device , this is a monster for this price range . All the review i read about this phone before buying was heating issue , screen flickering , and battery . I will clarify about this issues . First is screen flickering - we can ' t able to experience any type of flickering issues with normal eyes . It can only see through other cameras . About 70 percent smart phones have flickering in low brightness . And will be fixed with update . Second is heating - no heating at all for me for normal use and heavy usage like just every other phones heating . While charging it will heat up . Its 66W charging ( not 10 W charging . ) . Every phone with high wattage charge will heat up . Third is battery - yes battery draining is there . But with 66W charge you will not able to realise the battery draining . Now a days phones with high wattage charger has battery draining . Thats not an issue . Overall blindly go for this phones at this price segment . Its a worth buying . TRULY ITS A MONSTER####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive']]
Its a gaming phone I didn ' t find the camera particularly good many oppo realme phones have almost the same quality . If you want camera in this range then go for the Samsung fe series . And fingerprint scanner i find it bit off and rest it ' s a great budget phone in this range . But if you are looking right now the wait for the iq10 im sure it will come soon with gen1 processsor .####[['fingerprint scanner', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Everything thing is good and it is more than enough for daily operations at this price range . The only problem with this phone is output sound from speakers whoch isnot that good . If you talk outside or watch movie it is not loud enough . camera is too good . Batery life is also good . Phone is having heating problem when you use camera 10 minutes continuously but it is common issue in 8 series Snap dragon processor .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['speakers', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Batery life', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
I brought iqoo 9 se 12gb varient on 2nd of may at 26000 after exchange and discount . Ad 888 Little heat but good . I dont know why in premium segment 2 mp camera is given . Its of no use . 2nd it has slightly low builed quality if i compare it with other brands in this price range . Within three months i gone for its screen replacement which costs 6800 . Performance wise it is a great phone , camera ok but not too good . And as i said earlier you have to compromise with its build quality . In future i am not going to buy any iqoo brand .####[['Ad 888', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['iqoo 9', 'negative'], ['Performance', 'positive'], ['screen replacement', 'negative'], ['iqoo brand', 'negative']]
Average rear camera on both night and day time . Good display , brightness is ok , no flickering at all , stereo speakers are ok , front camera is superb , rear camera for just a photo is good , but for videos the setup is worst , jitters and overprocessed looks , call quality is awesome , connectivities are very good , processing is speeding is fast as expected , bloatwares are not so much intimidating , you can uninstall most of them turn off notifications for the rest , battery backup is ok , for a office guy this backup just enough , charging speed is around 40 - 50 min , iam no gamer , so i don ' t know about the gaming experience , overall a good choice for me . By the way the looks are nice , and i didn ' t feel this as a hefty phone may be because i have big hands .####[['rear camera', 'neutral'], ['display', 'positive'], ['display', 'neutral'], ['stereo speakers', 'neutral'], ['front camera', 'positive'], ['rear camera', 'negative'], ['call quality', 'positive']]

Display Quality is the worst even tho it ' s amoled display . It have snapdragon 888 and it get soo hot even when we use whatsapp video call . And it drains battery so fast . My previous phone was Poco f1 even after 3 years it never let me down . This device just disappointed me from the first month of using .

This is the best phone u can get under 30k if you consider performance although it ' s also good In others aspects like media consumption and camera .

I just got delivered the phone . After phone setup while using it as the daily driver ( no gaming ) the phone is heating up near the camera area . I have seen the reviews on YouTube , they also said this about the heating issue . It ' s quite strange to me despite having liquid cooling etc phone is heating on daily tasks operations .

I am giving rating of this mobile 1 out of 5 because when I received this item it ' s look like used mobile and I noticed some lagging issues some times when I open the apps it ' s automatically closed and stuck at middle of the working and also the main issue I noticed battery draining issue when I watch the 2 minutes youtube video it is taken 10 % charge it ' s immediately decrease the battery .

Product is very good it has many new features . But i didn ' t like this camera bcz when we click pic we see some black outlines , camera quality is not too good and volume also , when we put volume on half we can ' t hear anything , And battery life is very long we can use this mobile minimum 9 / 10 Hours Easily without Any hang But I Like this product which were purchased in budget####[['Product', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['volume', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive']]
I believe it ' s priced a little bit on the higher side but still it ' s better than its competitors . Display is less bright than I hoped , with okayish resolution . I have put it on ' Performance boost ' 24 / 7 mode which reduces battery life but it does feel a bit more snappy and fast . It doesn ' t feel premium in the hand but it ' s ' 4 camera layout ' tricks others that it ' s a Rs12000 + phone ; atleast from afar .####[['Display', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
This phone is worth buying at this price . It is very handy and the battery backup of the phone is excellent . And the fingerprint reader is also very smooth and fast .

The user interface is not as smooth as it should be right now , but I feel the updates might fix it . . . and as per mentioned specs , it works well .

The phone is pretty good . The back design of the phone is very old sorta . Not that good . The fingerprint reader is cool . The phone started lagging at some points instantly .

I would recommend it for elderly people .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['fingerprint reader', 'positive'], ['Camera quality', 'neutral']]
I only disliked the look and size of the phone . In the pictures , the phone looks very stylish , bit in reality , it is not . It is shown that it has a screen size of almost 6 . 53 inches .

This phone is decent at this price point but I think the processor they are providing is not up to the mark with this phone . Main Advantages of this phone is that 1GB virtual ram is also provided by Redmi . Lokks wize it is good those parallel lines they are providing is pretty cool . Build quality is decent . Although it is an 4 on 5 phone . I recommend you to buy this phone on sale for extra discount and offers .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['processor', 'negative'], ['ram', 'positive']]
The very Basic Feature like Batter Charge Indicator Led Light that also serves the purpose of indicating Missed Calls or Un - seen Messages is missing .

Although most of things about purchase can be considered decent given the price I paid for it but the most unjustifiable problem with the phone was it ' s performance . It ' s hella slow for a phone a with 4gb ram and opens everything too late . The redme 9A sport I bought for a relative has a better performance with only 2gb ram . I first thought it ' s just happening because we ' re setting it up but it persisted and is still quite slow . Also the fingerprint sensor is also not that responsive . Overall Average to poor experience . I got it for 7k but I would recommend to go for something else if you want to spend 7k or more . Thank you .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['4gb ram', 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'negative']]

Smart Phone are costly junk , that gets corrupted whatever brand it is , they last for 2 years and costly service .

I ordered this phone and it ' s hanging and switching off by itself . So I tried to replace the phone .

I am posting this review after extensive use of the mobile and I can surely say that this is the one of the best budget 5G mobile which comes with a nice processor and able to handle all day to day task with very smoothly and with ease .

This phone is O . K for me as I am not a heavey gamer or photographer , although i watch a lot of videos on phone . After extensive research , I selected this 5 G phone . First it was cheapest in this range and was providing maximum features . 2nd Dual speakers are really good . 3rd Charger was also with in box , which charges my phone really fast . 4th Camera is also O . K . if you are not shooter . However only drawback is it really sucks in sunlight , screen almost goes black and Unnecessary apps are also annoying .

I had purchased this to gift to my SIS for rakhi . She loved the phone . The camera quailty is good but not execllent and it was quick to lock focus .

I bought this phone for Rs . 15 , 300 / - and the phone is nice but there is little lag in Fingerprint sensor placed at the side of the phone otherwise the phone is good in this price range . The phone gets charged in just 45 to 50 minutes from 15 % to 100 % . Battery backup is also good it last for around two days if not used extensively . The company should provide atleast one more rear camera in this price range .

Earlier I was confused about buying note 10 pro or 11t 5g . No doubt note 10 pro ' s camera & display quality is better than 11t but it cannot beat 11t ' s performance and battery . Yeah I also agree 11t ' s camera quality and display could have been better but still I don ' t have any issue . They ' re doing well for me . Its display is quite good and it is not that bad as it is shown in some YT review videos when we ' re outside . Now when comes to the performance and battery , this phone is a beast man . . ! !

The product is a good budget smartphone . Camera Quality is 5 - Star . Display and touch Sensitivity , gestures is good . Fingerprint scanner is slow .

Battery life and performance is good and charging with 33 watt is satisfactory . Could have more little more brightness expected in outdoors . Sound is good and watching media content is pleasing with its thin display edges . Ram management is need to improve , even if it having 6 gb ram plus 2 gb virtual ram features it kills most of apps in the background . Camera is average and need software update along with andriod 12 . Front camera is good as compare to back . No any heating or lag issue in day to day uses . Call quality is good , loud and clear but lacks premium phone like quality . 5g capable with mediatek 810 . Security update is slower than low budget mi phones as now I received may month patch and it ' s already July month . Overall good phone but need improvement through update for sure . If you don ' t want to spend 20k on phone but need powerful and overall good package then you can go for it as all 5g phone under 20 k has lots of compromise but this has very few .####[['Battery', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'positive'], ['display', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['Ram management', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Front camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Call quality', 'positive'], ['mediatek 810', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Call quality', 'negative'], ['phone', 'neutral']]
The camera should be improved the 50MP camera looks like a 12mp photos taken on an entry - level mobile The display is quite descent the viewing angles should be better The design of this phone makes it the best looking smartphone in the segment especially the Stardust White colour is super attractive and eye catchy The battery life is super good all thanks to 6nm processor and 5000mAh battery####[['camera', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive']]
Providing review on product performance before 24 hr not good idea . However I am forced to put product with accessories I have received missing items like screen cleaner and sim ejector . It ' s mentioned when I buy but in box those are missing . Handset performance seems good will give review after some week useage . Overall delivery and packing need to improve all items are included !####[['delivery and packing', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]

The first phone I got had damaged speakers . The replacement is good in all aspects . The Speaker is very loud and doesn ' t crack at high volume . Battery doesn ' t last full day as advertised , maybe yes , if you keep it idle . Phone is performance based and works smoothly . It doesn ' t heat up while working , but it does while charging . Front camera is decent but rear camera is despicable . It ' s not the quality but the contrast level that makes you look ugly by making every crease on your face prominent .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['Speaker', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'positive'], ['Front camera', 'positive'], ['rear camera', 'negative']]
This mobile phone not as good as it looks . Because it has hanging problems . Most of the times it gets hang and due to this anything has been opened automatically and sometimes touch doesn ' t work properly . When it get restart then this phone works properly .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['touch', 'negative']]
The cameras photo quality was not bad but the video quality was so bad it just glicthes sometimes like it make some part very dark and the other parts very bright and the back panel is like made up of toy plastic the back panel is so bad that it felt like you can snap it with your fingers it can break if you tap on it with your fingernail a little hard . It ' s like giving so many cons for giving 5g at this price####[['cameras', 'neutral'], ['cameras', 'negative'], ['back panel', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Good 5g phone . But no way to use external memory support , card . Weight is more . Camera quality is not good like oppo or Vivo . It ' s good for those who are using phone only for regular calls and messages , or watching videos . Not good for teenagers or youngsters those who spend more time in mobile####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
During incoming calls screen do not unlock and display remain black cant see calls only ringtone plays and when manually unlock the screen call doesnt show . on notification it shows but answering declining do not work . even the volume of mobile is so much poor that cant hear calls with full volume or even songs or any media . this is basic function of mobile but it failed in that . even my replacement had worst issue of UI keep flickering and screen keep switch on and off during any incoming call . see the attached videos####[['display', 'negative'], ['volume', 'negative'], ['UI', 'negative']]
I thought the camera will be good but very much dissatisfaction , there is a some glitch in the camera as there is shadow in every click and today i found that camera unable scan the scanner of a smartwatch . I gifted the phone to my younger sister and bought it specially for the camera as she likes clicking pictures very much yet she felt bad about it so am i as I couldn’t able to give her that satisfaction with the camera####[['camera', 'negative']]
Phone is slow as compare to it ' s specs . Major issue is it ' s calling glitch . Screen becomes black after dialing a number Or receiving a call not able to cut the call . Call ending is on the mercy of other sides person . Or wait till it automatically cuts . Happening on daily basis or any time .####[['Phone', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'negative']]
Desent phone overall . Battery life is good , charges in less time . Just a few cons - Bad camera quality pictures break into pixels , the brightness is very low even when you raise it to full brightness level , cannot insert sd card if you have 2 sims ( only 2 slots , 1 for sim , other for sim / sd card , only 1 can be inserted ) . There is no bling light like in previous models ( the small led blinking continuously when the screen is asleep for notifications ) , you don ' t know if u have any notifications till u wake the screen . Also the fingerprint sensor sometimes will not unlock the phone ( very rare , but happens ) , so u have to type in the password .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['brightness', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'negative']]
I dont know why redmi nowadays degrading the quality . I really miss an era when I loved to use redmi phones . Camera quality is totally waste . While on video call , other person can ' t see me camera captures black video . Not sure how to resolve this but I had purchased redmi note 11 and it had similar issue .####[['Camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['redmi', 'negative']]
Camera quality is not meet the expectations but gives ok ok performance . It ' s battery is not good after using 1 hours or half an hour continuosly it ' s temprature is going high even you use lightily but battery backup is good . Some time it ' s hang and create problems to operate some apps smoothly .

The performance of this mobile is not what Mi used to provide in previous phones . Dual speaker is of no use ! The speaker on the top of the phone is barely audible . There is no notification or charging LED . The notifications will only pop up after few seconds after you will unlock the phone and use it . The camera is optimised for close - up photos . The Macro camera is missing !

First of all , it ' s starting laging after the return window period over , now I have to take this to redimi service centre , reason being , while calling screen goes blank , and it took longer time to load the app , have checked every software update in the phone . Overall bad experience .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['app', 'negative']]
It ' s been more than a month since I have been using this phone . . . And i am not at all happy . The worst part in this is the camera quality which is really bad . The pictures come blurred or the colour of the object is altered . Even the phone speaker isn ' t loud enough if u want to watch a movie or listen to music . Other things like battery and display are good . But i regret buying this phone .####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['display', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
The product quality was quite disappointing . Basic features like sound quality of incoming voice calls is very poor and unclear as well as camera quality is not upto the mark .

Never except that REDMI product is become so bad that is comparable with under 6k budget phones . . . the camera is worst for 19k I bought this phone and it ' s utterly waste of money I could bought some other brand phone with good cam clarity and the battery sucks like hell I received a faulty product and the launcher crashes suddenly in the mid of users usage which the basic necessity that a person bought higher GB RAM phone for multitasking and this phone is not doing it at all####[['camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Battery is good , fast charging is good , camera is decent quality . The biggest issue I face with this mobile is whenever i use google maps navigation it starts showing " searching for GPS " . I have been to redimi service , they just rest the phone and gave it back to me . No use , issue is still the same . I did try various other options shown in youtube , but no use . Its very irritating , every time GPS don ' t work . None of the GPS based apps work , like mobile speedometer , railway unreserved ticket booking etc . Not satisfied .####[['Battery', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['GPS', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Finger print does not work everytime . I have to use password most of the time .

I am writing this review after 6 month of use , earlier i was using Redmi 6 pro and that phone was superb but this phone hang and even you don ' t have control in it , it open all the app in your phone and do some thing and it doesn ' t allow to switch off as well and it goes till 5 to 10 min , some time I scared it won ' t blast . . it ' s wrost phone from MI . . i have factory reset the mobile but still it have issue####[['phone', 'negative']]
Just after 6 months of usage . The phone hangs , it ' s slow after switching to 90htz refresh . It ' s really cumbersome to use , if you wish to do multi - tasking . If you are calling and want to check some mail Or gallary it goes in sleepmode and just cannot make it active but you can simply continue your call . While calling it will open some other app due to sensitive touch then it ' s a nightmare to come back on calling screen in case you wish to use ivr menu . Camera is pathetic . Sound is pathetic , even my le2 was better . Contacts app is useless cannot be managed .

Please don ' t fall for this fraud within one day it turned out to be a defective product . With regard to Amazon they have been friendly with me but all this is very time consuming .

I am writing this review after using Tecno spark 8T for more than 5 months . Phone performance is good in this segment . This mobile provide dual sim of 4g VOLTE connectivity . You can use both sim for 4g volte connection . I like most the seamlessly data network switching function at your need by single tap . Videos runs without flicker and screen quality is good . Little draw back is it ' s speaker .

Never buy these tecno smartphones , because in all these tecno phones there is full of bloatware which can be very problematic , in my case it fails to connect to my projector mirrorcast because in the phone root it is programmed only to connect with tv mirrorcast not with other mirrorcast there is lag while watching movies playing games even simple one like subway surfer , very bad ram management , reason is pre installed bloatware wich is the part of phone os neither u can disable nor u can uninstall , one good thing is fhd + display .

I ' m writing this review for the sole purpose of giving my vote that Tecno has outdone themselves with this product . All of your basic fears are unneeded .

Outstanding phone from Techno . See the photographs . Enlarge it . It will not fade out rather the real photograph will come out . I have compared it with Vivo X90 . In photographs facing bright light the picture of Vivo loses the skin tone , if you enlarge . This phone is really gorgeous . I am really fortunate that I choosed it not iPhone 14 plus at this price . This phone is really gorgeous in hand . I am using it throughout the day seeing You Tube but could not finish the Battery . Remember , the Always on Display is Video not photo . A great feel in hand . The fold will not automatically open even if you hang it with one leaf of it . Really great in aesthetics too . If one can afford , this is indeed a great phone to buy . Techno had really came out as a brand . It ' s great . An extraordinary phone . You can take selfies with flashlight on with the Rear Camera .####[['Techno', 'positive'], ['Rear Camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]

I didn ' t want to spend 1 . 5 Lakhs on the new fold 4 , so bought the Phantom V Fold after hearing great feedback from the YouTube community . This phone is a massive upgrade to the Samsung Fold 3 which I was previously using . The camera is superb , touch is way better than Samsung , the interface is very good , bigger screen . Over all it feels great to hold the phone . Also the back cover free with the phone makes it very easy to hold it when fully open . This is my best phone buy till date .

Very excited to be a user of phantom V Fold . . Just I can say amazing phone and value for money . . Everything is just superb . .

This is an amazing phone . Once my son had taken our scooter with him . Not knowing what to do , I said , " Hello Google . Take me to office . " Suprisingly the phone asked me to open it and sit on the screen . When I did so , it transported me within seconds to my office . This phone has the ability to solve all the problems of India ! ! According to me the price of this phone should atleast be 10 lakhs .####[['phone', 'positive']]
Man o man , this is my first fold and also my first phone above 30k . Was very skeptical to buy it and even cancelled once then bought it finally . I should tell you that this phone is a beast when it comes to performance , features , security , the fold experience . It has everything one would ask for in a fold and some more . It has the perfect aspect ratio for both screens , has the largest battery life and the UI and tecno has so much more to offer . Within 7 days of purchase got 2 system updates and improvements . The camera is not the most perfect but I am nt a camera guy so didnt bother me . Overall very happy with the purchase and worth the price .

If phantom will be able to reconstruct it ' s software properly this phone is marvelous . There is sometimes network issue , heating problem this can be fix by software update .

I see too many 5 star reviews for this phone . I also saw lot of videos on you tube and all spoke highly about the phone and I decided to buy the phone . Else than a gold phone there is nothing else you will get for this cost . The phone is so heavy that you need both hands to operate which is very frustrating when you are on the move or is busy with something and just want to check the phone . Attending calls on speaker is a nightmare , volume is too low and hard to communicate on speaker mode . Battery is a disaster , I charged the phone to 100 percent and by afternoon 1 pm , battery is just 35 percent left and I didn ' t even use the fold open mode much , I didn ' t watch any video etc . I didn ' t play any game . Overall just a gold phone . Not for people looking for an easy going life with the phone .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative']]
Bad Bad Bad i encountered this problem with tecno display both on outer and inner displays , I bought this phone for my mother since she always liked bigger displays but foldables were out of my budget for so long kudos to tclecno team for making this possible device is absolute beauty outside and a beast inside not only looks the device ui and features are also great best device to watch old 4 : 3 ration films my mom liked device very much as I already stated camera is decent not bad .

This is the best one for gaming , best phone under 12000 . But the camera filter is not so good , but also I ' m happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi , gta , critical strike and many games at a time , and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay . This phone is not for reel ' stars or photography . But u will get 90 hz display it is so sooth then other .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['90 hz display', 'positive']]
Its really a good find for me TECNO POVA 4 in 12k budget . After a complete 4 day use I must say that this a phone which I was looking for months . Its big memory 13GB & 128GB storage keeps all my things intact . I played a few heavy games & I am quite satisfied with the performance Even selfies & back camera are a real good one & gives professional pictures .

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device . Wish i had gone with poco , the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues . And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates . Plus you got to stick with booring hios .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['hios', 'negative'], ['rom', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'conflict']]
If you are taking it for gaming then look at another phone because everything is good in this phone but the display is not right .

Finally got 5G supporting worth smartphone at this price which do supports both Airtel and Jio 5G with 13 Bands compared to other who either support one and doesn ' t support other one !

First of all I used this device for business purposes , Battery is best part of it almost 3 days still 8 % remaining , I use whatsapp , youtube , Google Chrome , calls and sometimes camera . All this work like a charm . Look and Display are very nice , Display is big enough for your daily work and to keep in your pocket . camera is batter then other Chinese variants , it has gorilla Glass protection and no IP protection means you need to protect it from water splash . Battery In whole night only use 2 % , no bloatware , clean os , not any false battery draining . I used Jio 5G works like butter in Mumbai . Used this phone for 7 days there is no lag I found in any software , software opening is fast . Overall it ' s best phone for day to day life work and business purposes . I have 6 GB variant .

Good phone in its category in budget segment . Special highlight is it ' s monster battery + Above average camera and ok type performance . This phone is not for a gamer / photographer because it can provide you everything in its limit . Never compare it with Galaxy S23 Ultra or iPhone 14 like performance and feature . It is just like comparing Alto with BMW or Ferrari . Where Alto is best known for its mileage this phone is best for its battery endurance .

Ordered it for my Dad . Samsung never disappoints . Decent screen and camera quality . Performance wise its so good , did not face any issue till now . Seen other bad reviews , probably they are using it with other unwanted apps , bloatwares and expecting very high end gaming performance . Even I bought only 4GB RAM version and it works like a charm without any hiccups , 4G carrier aggregation , 5G reception and speed everything works fine . Only CON was I had to purchase 25W adapter separately which adds additional cost because of only which giving 4 star rating otherwise would have given 5 .####[['Samsung', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['Performance', 'positive'], ['5G reception', 'positive'], ['4G carrier aggregation', 'positive'], ['25W adapter', 'negative']]
A really good phone at this price range good for daily usage i don ' t do gaming much so processor is not a issue for me . It has good screen good camera handle day today stuff with easy big battery Only downside is it doesn ' t come with a charge .

I purchased this phone on the day it was launched and I found defects on the display and the phone was defective . Defective because the portion below the sim slot on the left hand side made clicking sound when pressed which means the case is little bigger than the phone . I returned the phone and the new phone also came with the same defect but now on the right hand side below the fingerprint sensor . I m returning it again . Only good thing is the battery but if it comes with a defect then what ' s the point ? Also when you are spending 1000 more for the charger . Highly disappointed .####[['display', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['charger', 'negative']]
Poor performance , bad built quality , bulky and heavy in this segment . Specifications of camera is good but it doesn ' t deliver quantity pics . Low performance of camera is super super bad . Issues are also there with normal network connectivity . Many times tower will go off whereas in other phones it will be there . I purchased at 13 . 5K but even if you get at 9K , it ' s a bad deal . .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['network connectivity', 'negative']]
It ' s an utter disgrace that it comes with no charger and fast charging is not compatible with other brand chargers . Apart from that , it just randomly switches to 4g from 5g with no option to revert back to 5g . It depends on the phone ' s mood to let you use 5g or not , defeating the complete purpose buying a 5g device . Utterly useless piece of trash . Do not buy . Better go for a snapdragon processor phone that comes with a charger .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['5g', 'negative'], ['charger', 'negative']]
I ' m facing heating issues from day one of purchase . I haven ' t installed any game till now but still facing heavy heating issues with just 15mins of continuous use . Screen gets freeze often .

I like the specifications of the phone which are mid - range specifications of under rs20 , 000 . . . the battery is so huge can easily operate whole day once charged full , the fingerprint and face lock are really fast , like mid - range smartphone , camara is perfect for under 10 , 000 , also one thing I like it it has Bokeh mode in videography . . But one thing is bad for this phone , which is gyro , this phone doesn ' t had a gyroscope . . . . . . Last but not the least it has supper smooth experience when I open any app , the app opens with animation with smooth experience . . That ' s it for my side . . . . Phone is best for low range with specifications of Mid - range smartphone . . .

Recommended for everyone whose budget is under 10K . Budgetwise camera and mobile is out of the world . Amazing . Bought it at 9K . Provides more features than other phones in this range . Camera quality is superb . More than expected I would say . Recommended to everyone if their budget is below 10K . Bloatwares can be easily uninstalled . Designwise and performancewise perfect phone for 9K price tag . Has many features like SOCIAL TURBO mode , which enhances the WhatsApp usage experience . It also has smart charging protection for the battery i . e . it stops charging when the battery is fully charged .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Bloatwares', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive']]
In this price , it is the best deal . Camera quality is very good , video quality very good . Very advance features . Battery charging time : 1 hour . Battery back up good . Front light and beauty Plus option while video calling . UI is good and easy . Overall it is worth buying . Problems : when I close the tabs , touch screen works poorly , otherwise touch screen is fine . I prefer closing all tabs at the same time then . Second : low audio sound due to one speaker , no Dolby Atoms .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['UI', 'positive'], ['touch screen', 'negative']]
Honestly speaking I was looking for a phone which contains a good battery , fast charging , 4gb ram and super performance with a good display quality . And this phone literally fulfilled each and every aspects except camera , and it was never my concern . But in this price range I can assure you it has more than average camera . So if you are looking for a phone under 10000 , you should go for it . It is the best option for sure .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]

Small small terms are in this mobile are so irritating . In this smartphone I get google dialer and google massage which is so irritating when I am recording any call the dialer speak aloud that your call is recording and when I am finding call recording , I didn ' t get that neither in file manager nor in contact history .

Since it was a very new brand in the market so I thought of giving it a try . So disappointed with the product . In terms of hardware the mobile is still fine except that oversized screen but in terms of software Tecno needs to work a lot . There are many issues with the software means in terms of features . Many times missed notifications . Many features enabled but don ' t work all the time .

This was the first time I put temper screen by myself. Since im a novice, there was bubbles after applying but not many. I applied the whole glue and shown in UV light they have given along with it. I brought down my mobile so many times in low distance I have some cracks but that scratches not visible as we put temper glass in regular mobile stores, it was very lite. One should keenly watch my mobile to find out whether it has crack or not. Though price is high, I have put temper glass for same price outside but that was not last even for 3 months. This is worth for money. Original temper glass I think not cheap quality.####[]

As always , Nokia has yet again amazed us with a new powerful budget smartphone ! There’s nothing to not love about this device - the large HD + screen ( though FHD could have been provided at this price range ) with 90Hz refresh rate ; fast , responsive Fingerprint Sensor ; the camera is so much better with AI imaging ! And as always , Stock Android and Nokia’s Optimised Performance combined offer a long battery life of at - least 2 days ! The back panel has a textured finish , I personally love the design ! The device came with pre - applied Screen Protector , but you’d want to get a new edge - to - edge screen protector applied as the one that it came with wouldn’t withstand scratches or falls from heights . All in all , definitely a smart buy !####[['Nokia', 'positive'], ['smartphone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint Sensor', 'positive'], ['Stock Android', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['back panel', 'positive'], ['Screen Protector', 'positive']]

The phone offers stock Android and 2 guaranteed Android updates which makes it a good choice in the price segment .  Battery backup lasts you well over a day on average usage and fast charging could have been better but the intended user group won ' t complain about it at the price .  Face unlock is really good .

The mobile is working nice and battery backup is good . I like the battery backup and touch screen . The cell is so nice and look wise it ' s great . But it ' s best mobile at this price . The drawback of the mobile is camera clarity and screen resolution . Eventjough its mentioned that it has 50MP resolution , it does give pictures of that quality .  But after using for 2 weeks i realised that the phone hangs atleast Once in 30 min . Poor performance . Some options won ' t work for some time .

I recently purchased the Nokia G11 Plus mobile phone , and unfortunately , my experience with this phone has not been great . It has some significant issues that make it difficult to use . One of the most frustrating issues with this phone is that it hangs too much , making it hard to complete even simple tasks . Additionally , the phone has a tendency to switch off randomly , which can be quite inconvenient , especially when I ' m in the middle of something important .  The battery life on this phone is also a major concern . The battery drains very rapidly , even when the phone is not in use , which means that I have to charge it frequently throughout the day .####[['Nokia G11 Plus', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative']]

I brought this phone primarily hoping that it would have a long battery life and I would be able to just use it to send and receive phone calls .

I purposely chose Nokia over other brands in this value segment because it is a brand that I innately trust . Also , it isn ' t just emotions at work here , this is a device that runs on stock android , has a good screen size , is light and not bulky , and comes at a price that doesn ' t hurt the wallet . Personally , I ' m a OnePlus 7Pro user . However , should that ever get damaged or stolen and I should need a back - up phone for long - term usage as a follower of minimalism , I ' ll opt for this in a heartbeat . The delivery occurred on time , the price was good courtesy the Amazon cashback offers , and the phone makes the person who received it as a gift happy , so all in all , a good purchase !####[['Nokia', 'positive'], ['stock android', 'positive'], ['screen size', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'positive']]
I ' ve bought Nokia G21 after using Nokia 8 . 1 for three years . The previous experiences of Nokia has always been pleasant . With Nokia G21 , my experience has only been elevated . At the outset , the feel of the phone is fabulous . The added new features of Android 12 gives a smooth experiences , coupled with a power pack battery life . Regular security updates and OS upgradation surely makes Nokia G21 , a class apart with other competitors in the market . The AI 50 MP camera gives a superb quality to the photographs . The build quality is smooth and gives a premium feel and look . The phone is fully featured loaded just as it is expected . The best part of Nokia has always been a bloat free apps in the phone . Overall a very nice phone . I ' ll surely recommend others to buy Nokia G21 phone until 5G network is fully established and rolled out pan - India .####[['Nokia G21', 'positive'], ['Android 12', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['OS', 'positive'], ['AI 50 MP camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['apps', 'positive']]
I am impressed by the Nokia series of phones ; I got this one for my dad and so far he has been extremely satisfied with the phone . The device feels and looks sturdy and despite the low price compared to other brands , it is pretty responsive and does not display any lag . Plus , the absence of any manufacturer ' s own bloatware makes it a very " light " phone to use , and not confusing the elders like him . I am not very gung ho about its camera though , and hence I have not gone ahead and given 5 stars . And its not like my dad is into professional photography so not an issue at all . In a nutshell , I am impressed by the Nokia series , given the features and its price point and I have gone ahead and got the C21 Plus for my teenager two days back . I am definitely recommending it for users looking for a budget friendly mobile device .####[['mobile', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative']]

I presented this phone to my Father in - law and mother in - law recently . They were never familiar with Android phone and had been using the old nokia handsets forever . Initially they were a bit hesitant to use it but as we started teaching them , they found the simplicity of this model and were soon excited to use them ! It ' s been a week since they have been using the Nokia G21 and they ' re really happy with it . The audio quality of the phone is excellent . They are super excited about the camera since they never clicked photos of their own . My father in - law watches cricket on YouTube and the wide screen of the phone does justice to his cricket cravings . The UI of the phone is user friendly , security measures are on power and the 50MP camera helps my mom in - law take amazing photos of her beautiful garden !

Fingerprint reader is snappy , battery life is huge - can last upto 3 days without charging if used for basic purpose like calling and wifi on full time , and moderate internet usage and apps , calls , etc . Camera quality is okay in this range considering price . Body looks good . Performance is also good , at the beginning it was snappy , but now a little less reponsive after about 15 days of usage - still good . Android version is 11 , not sure if there is gonna be 12 or 13 , though .

Phone is ok for general usage , but my struggles with Nokia continue . The place where I live has no proper mobile reception , I ' m heavily dependent on Vo Wifi calling . i had absolutely no issues with my previous Samsung phone , but Nokia G21 frequently disconnects in the middle of a call . I tried reaching out to customer service but was not helpful . Advertisements are promising but I don ' t find it living up to it . Camera is not great either . Promise of 2year updates is another disappointment . There is Android 13 available and my G21 still runs on Android 11 . At this rate , they can promise 4 years of updates also but it does not help customers .  I always knew Nokia is bit expensive at this range compared to others . Only because my affinity towards Nokia I still bought this one , though I didn ' t have a great experience with Nokia 6 either . Nokia has got the advertisements right , but it is high time they start delivering those promises####[['Nokia G21', 'neutral'], ['Nokia G21', 'negative'], ['customer service', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Nokia', 'negative'], ['Android 13', 'negative']]
Overall experience is better , no lagging , best usage in office use and general purposes , I would suggest though , go with the 6gb RAM and 128gb Internal Storage expandable memory upto 512gb varient . camera quality is decent but the most noticeable is the battery backup which is phenomenal . But there is a reason to giving it 3 stars . Whenever you buy , there will be a sticker attach to the package saying that you have to give 5 stars and write a great review in amazon and take a screen shot and post it to Nokia ' s official site to get Brand new Nokia Earphones ( Which is a gimmick ) . It is a total mar letting strategy . And I would like to add that it ' s speaker sound is not going to be satisfying . So buy with caution and checking your requirements .####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]

I have been using Nokia 3 for the past 4 and a half years . I wished to upgrade it as the software was old and my phone hardware began to show issues too . Chose Nokia g21 as it was a budget phone . Camera and other superb performances were not important for me . But it disappointed me as the phone fails to connect to the saved wifi networks automatically . I tried out all the possible solutions shown in the youtube videos available ( restarting phone , resetting network settings , re - saving wifi and even static ip was given ) but everything failed .

The phone ' s battery is experiencing excessive heat , which is concerning . I had Nokia mobile phones long back . I used to always trust this brand . But in the middle as it was not having Android phone , So for last couple of years , I have used either Iphone or Samsung . However , upon discovering that Nokia now offers Android phones , I decided to purchase it . I stay in USA and bought it for my Father in India from Amazon . I was thrilled to be able to gift him a brand that we both had faith in . Unfortunately , the phone has not lived up to our expectations . It lacks the durability and reliability that we associated with the Nokia brand , which I had even boasted about in stories of my old Nokia phone still functioning today . The battery overheating issue has rendered the phone unusable , causing me to lose faith in the brand that I had once trusted so deeply . It is a total loss buying this . It is disheartening to have paid the price for my past trust in Nokia without realizing that this new Nokia not the same .####[['battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Nokia', 'negative']]

I use my phone for online counseling sessions , and this phone has a terrible echo problem when put on speaker , and the person on the other end can ' t even have a proper conversation because they can constantly hear their own voice ! I got a replacement handset but still had the same problem . I tried to get technicians to visit , but none of them did ! The camera was good , and so was the battery life , but the user interface is weird and very confusing . Also , the OS kept asking me to reformat my memory card so I kept losing all my data ! ! Not sure why this phone is getting such high reviews . I believe it ' s probably because the phone box says you ' ll get a free set of earphones if you write a good review ! Eventually , I tried to return it and that too was a horrendous ordeal because I didn ' t get the refund despite giving the phone back , for over two weeks after multiple follow ups ! Please don ' t buy phones online ! Lesson learned !####[['phone', 'negative'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['user interface', 'negative'], ['OS', 'negative'], ['online', 'negative']]
This phone is just awesome for this budget . Not for fans of high end mobiles nor for high setting gamers . Its not cheap plastic as mentioned on youtube by some youtubers . This is a budget phone with very good specification and in reality as well . I am a moderate user and this phone fulfils all my needs . Its truely an allrounder and lets not compare it with higher budget phones . Display is quite good and soothing but not too bright and punchi as its just hd , but it does not look like . Its preety up and down compared to its competators and then its you to decide and your trust on the brand . It looks fabulous and especially the lunar red one and is in no way inferior . Much premium in hand feeling and quite light in weight . Its preety flat at the back . I think xiomi has done a great job on this phone and at this budget . Perfect phone for medium users . I definately recommened this phone . Only the changing wire shd have been a little longer .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'neutral'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Display', 'neutral'], ['xiomi', 'positive']]
This phone falls under beginner level smart phone . This handset is very much suitable for average users who spend time on YouTube and whatsapp or you can say moderate user . If u expect good gaming experience this phone is big NO . Battery performance is very impressive . Display is very nice indoors bit in outdoor u need to switch to 100 % brightness level . Camera is decent in that price range . Finger print scanner is fast enough . Without cover handset is slippery . Provided cover barely gives any protection to it ' s camera lens . Need to buy a good cover which can protect its camera . Not a hybrid slot so that ' s a plus point . Good networ reception . Both the SIM 4G supported .####[['phone', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['Battery performance', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Display', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Finger print scanner', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Nothing which i didnt like in this phone at this peice point . Battery Backup is good . Colour combination is also good especially Lunar red . back Panel Is Of Plastic , which i think is good , As because It will Not Discolour over a period of time . And due to which at the time of resale Value of device would be decent . Face unlock best . Display quality Good Camera is Really very nice at this price point Both rear and Front camera . Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 octa core 1 . 8ghz which is also very good .####[['Battery Backup', 'positive'], ['back Panel', 'negative'], ['Face unlock', 'positive'], ['rear and Front camera', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Qualcomm Snapdragon 632', 'positive']]
After 1 month usage of 2gb ram variant i got no issues becoz i installed very few apps and maintained 1 GB ram free everytime even after installing apps . I only installed 15 apps . The camera quality felt better than my redmi note 5 pro becoz it has AI camera where rn5 not have that so it takes very sharp and over saturated images . . . The battery life of both devices same . . Finger print sensor is somewhat slow but it ' s okay . . Overall product is good at its price don ' t miss it if u are are not heavy user . . The display is big and enough to watch movies in 720p####[['2gb ram', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Finger print sensor', 'neutral'], ['display', 'positive'], ['product', 'positive']]
After a disappointing performance from Samsung On 5 PRO I was looking something else to gift my wife . I found out about this new phone from Redmi the review was good so I bought it . The screen is good , touch is good , camera are decent . What disappoints me is the sound quality , it is very low volume here and the back cover is very thin . This mobile would be good for some one who uses it for casual web browsing , facebooking , music playing . This device heat up after playing 1 hour of youtube continuously .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['touch', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['sound quality', 'negative'], ['back cover', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'negative']]

I am using this phone from more than 10 days . I will give 4 out of 5 starts to this product . Design is good , sound is good . processor is enough for faster internet . All in a good package phone under 9k . But somehow i am getting problem with its display . What is happening that after use of more than 30 minutes my eyes getting tired and itchy . I cant stare to phone there after . I have other smart phone also and i used to see videos for hours . Working on laptop but never experienced before . I tried to replace but amazon refused by saying that is not a valid reason without giving any technical assistance . Please give my feedback to them and assist me as a good vendor .

I've used both realme c2 and redmi 7 for 2 weeks now and here's my review - redmi has better cameras, lil fast charging, back cover, better processor. Whereas realme has better shape & feels really good in hand redmi is kinda thick and requires two hands, better looking notch, doesn't get dirty easily like redmi, pre applied scratch guard so choose what you want from a phone. None of em lags in normal day to day tasks, both can be rooted, oem unlocking is supoorted in c2 too, both have google camera ports too but redmi clicks a lot better pics.####[]
Phone is lagging . Camera lagging . During pubg server didn ' t connect error for many times . so you can ' t play pubg in it . There is no eis in it hence it is not suitable for videography . Battery is huge & easily provide a backup for atleast 2 days ( standard usage ) . Battery takes atleast 2 . 30 hour to charge fully . This device doesn ' t support fast charging . Conclusion : 2GB ram is not enough for smooth experience . Though camera is lagging but the camera output is outstanding specially when we consider the price . In the price of ₹5400 it ' s a best option .####[['Phone', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['2GB ram', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Phone', 'positive']]
the phone is perfect for the price . camera is very good because camera2api is enabled so that you can use Google camera by installing the apk . display is acceptable in this prise point . battery is fabulous in this price . performance is very good even in 2gb of ram in 7thousand price you can close your eyes and buy it####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'positive']]
I am not happy with the cable lenth . Cable length should be more . After using 1 month , instead of 632 snapdragon processor i am facing little bit lagging while typing overall is better . Camera is good . U can charge phone in 2 hours . And those who r saying the display quality is bad the camera is not good they should buy apple phone . I have compared redmi 7 camera with realme and the camera of realme was worst . In 8000 rupees this phone is good compared to other brand . No heating , camera is good at this price . Those who r criticising they should buy phone of 12000 not 8000 . Now its price is 6000 and i bought for 8000 this is unfair .####[['632 snapdragon processor', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['632 snapdragon processor', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Never ever Buy a 10000 range mobile from redmi or xiaomi company cause they don ' t give a good quality mobile phone in the amount of near 10000 at 14000 is good but not in 10000 from redmi company other companies realme or oppo both offer good quality mobile phone near a range of 10000 but not redmi just had the usage of 6 months my phone starts hanging with a normal use and I never played game in that my phone and never downloaded the application which use online payment method but still within six months of uses the phone starts laging and in also it stops working suddenly that switch off and restart again unknowingly####[['redmi or xiaomi', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Worst phone ever , don ' t buy it . Miui is ridiculous lol . Lags like hell after 6 months of buying . Its the most laggy phone I ' ve ever used . Making a phone call even is difficult with this phone , I mean , come on ! With 2gigs of ram this phone barely passes the mark . Avoid buying this .####[['Miui', 'negative'], ['2gigs of ram', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Camera quality , fingerprint , design , UI , battery life , everything good . The only problem , the biggest and most annoying is hanging . Of the available 2 GB ram , only around 600mb will be available and becoz of that the phone keeps hanging while on call or whatsapp . Lots of bloatware and no way to remove them . After miui 11 update , things seemed better for a while and again back to level 1 .####[['Camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['UI', 'positive'], ['design', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['fingerprint', 'positive'], ['2 GB ram', 'negative'], ['bloatware', 'negative']]
I like the design , battery backup but I diss appointed with the performance of the base varient 2gb 32gb storage option this variant lags can ' t manage apps if we are live on insta or open Instagram camera if we have normal internet connection this phone hangs other varients of this phone is too good I can ' t play free fire on base varient but pubg lite runs smooth it has another issue is heating problem when you are in the place where temp . Is 35 - 38 degree this phone heats up to 42°c when you outside the home####[['2gb 32gb storage', 'negative'], ['2gb 32gb storage', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Phone looks and build quality is good . Screen resolution is not FHD . Elements and text looks big and zoomed . In a 6 inch + screen size it does not feel good . More over I think this model has some touch issues . I have to touch harder or multiple times to click an element . Hope Redmi fixes that via software update in future . Camera is average . Photos are good in sufficient lighting condition . Low light photos are not up to the mark . Battery seems ok . With my daily usage I am getting almost 2 days of battery life . Overall I think the phone is overpriced a bit . Best if offered within 8000 ( 3gb + 32gb ) range .####[['Phone looks', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'negative'], ['6 inch + screen', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['build quality', 'positive']]
I ' m happy with the features of the phone for the price at which it comes . However , I ' m very disappointed with the volume of ear piece . When I talk over phone , the other persons voice is not heard loud enough . I have keep asking them to repeat what they have said . This is very annoying as the basic functionality of phone is to make calls , and that itself is not working properly . Amazon is not giving refund . I ' m not sure if they are even giving replacement as the executive who came and checked the phone is not acknowledging the problem promptly .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['ear piece ', 'negative'], ['Amazon', 'negative'], ['Amazon', 'conflict'], ['executive', 'conflict']]
The call quality is terrible and the phone is already lagging very badly after 3 months . The user interface is something I personally hate as well . The fingerprint reader is very fast but phone stays in lock screen for sometime due to lag . Battery life is okay But call quality is terrible And it keeps disconnecting by itself from the WiFi and then you have to forget network and re - enter password for it to work again All in all made a very bad choice will be changing my phone soon .####[['call quality', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['fingerprint reader', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'neutral'], ['WiFi', 'negative']]
1 . Good display quality and colour deliverance 2 . Battery lasts for a day with average usage . 3 . I ' m not a gamer so I won ' t comment on the gaming performance . 4 . Works well for browsing and streaming purposes 5 . * * * * The worst part is that it doesn ' t have image stabilization , which ruins every shot . Furthermore the camera quality is below average * * * * 6 . Speaker and headphones work well .

Its fingerprint scanner are good but sometimes it not wrk properly although camera is very good and its give nature quality of my pics mean nature beauty I think battery life are not too good it take a long time to charging Overall , its processor are too bad it take a effect of display to saw a screen damage and is not made of gaming purpose####[['fingerprint scanner', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['processor', 'negative']]
Phone has good looks and great design . But don ' t let it fool you . Phone becomes slower as you start using it . Day after day RAM consumption increases and it ' s still a mystery why . There are hardly 2 - 3 apps installed still it lags . It is cheap , good looking phone but if you want phone which works with speed 2019 smartphones then I would suggest not to buy this one .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['RAM', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'negative']]
I ' m writing this review after 2 months of usage . And I strongly recommend not to go for this phone . I neither play game , nor I have installed unnecessary apps . I just use this phone for calling , whatsapp and YouTube . 1 . But the phone lags very very badly . It sometimes hangs too . 2 . Touch sensor doesn ' t work 3 out of 5 times . Even more . 3 . Call doesn ' t get connected even after swiping up . It happens almost each and every time . 4 . Battery is also not that much good . 5 .

After the good review i saw in online , i ordered this for my mom . It is not at all worth for the money we spent . Just after 2 months , it is not at all working . Even whatsapp is not working , photos we cannot take it will taken 5 min for each photo , no app will open everything will taken minimum 5 min , even phone lock also will not open . even after we power on it will take some time to show wallpaper then lock again after sometime only we can do anything with the phone .

(1 ) Very slow ( 2 ) No multi tasking , hangs ( 3 ) Gets automatically responds even though it was not touched . Hence based on apps , automatically navigates to some places . ( 4 ) Heavy office apps like outlook takes forever and by mistake tilted to landscape , takes another half an hour to adjust ( 5 ) Chrome just reopens every tab , even switched between other applications . Using payment gateway was not possible ( 6 ) Advertisements and notifications everywhere , even in apps like settings and browser ( 7 ) too many bloatware , can ' t even uninstallable .####[['bloatware', 'negative'], ['apps', 'negative'], ['Chrome', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
The phone is very slow . I had used redmi products earlier and never expected this to be so slow . If possible would like to exchange it with a faster one by paying the difference amount . This phone is not serving my purpose . When an incoming call comes , you will get the number displayed only after 10 - 15 seconds after it starts to ring . Also keeps hanging very often . Very disappointed ! ! !####[['phone', 'negative'], ['incoming call', 'negative'], ['redmi', 'negative']]
Mobile is very very slow it seems this is used product or else dummy piece I getting . finger print is working . camera is average . battery life is worst even if I using with wifi also I think this is first and last my mi product .

I ' ve been using it for 3 months now , because my previous phone fell into the sink and stopped working . I ' m writing the review from the same phone .

I ' m very happy and satisfied with this phone . It looks very beautiful and premium . I just love it . I like it ' s everything , it ' s prformance , smoothness , screen , camera , sound . I was looking for a slim and ligh 5G phone and it ' s more than my expections . Everything is superb . Battery back up is also good as it ' s 4250 MAH . It ' s fast recharge with 33wt is very good and I feel it ' s more than enough for anyone . I find this device , complete in all aspects . It ' s a superb 5G phone with HDR and 4K recording with 12 bands , it ' s with NFC too ( if u feel NFC feature would be helpful for you now and in future ) And dual speakers with dolby sound , what I was seaching badly in a slim light weight phone . Sound is also loud n clear . This is the only n only 5G mobile available in the market with all above features at this price . There is not any other in competition but inspite of that it ' s perfect . I ' m totally happy n satisfied and not find any cons till now since using last week . Highly recommended whose requirements are similar to mine . This is the only phone in this segment . For me it ' s a wow ! Amazing product at Amazon . Thanks . Superb , awesome phone , highly recommended for those whose requirements are as mine .

I like especially it ' s Dolby dual speaker which is on upper cum back side ( one in right & one in left side ) adjusted . These dual Dolby speakers functions like heaven . It really won my heart .

I got it for 18k and have no regrets , form factor build and software experience is pretty good .  First couple of days were a mess as I used to get a lot of ads in the mobile itself but after Miui update 13 all the ads gone away . It ' s like a clean slate as there are no junk apps now .  Display is crip and delight to watch , however in dark background scene you might notice some smudging of black which fine by me .  Best part is on performance it ' s top notch no lag or jitters at all and the device remains extremely cool I use it for hours while gaming and couldn ' t notice any warmth . . .  Battery is little less as compared to others but believe me even a 10 min charge can give you 40 % life so you don ' t feel the need for bigger one . You can easily get screen on time of more than 7 hours on balanced mode and 90hz####[['software', 'positive'], ['Miui update 13', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Display', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'positive']]
Hello guys , I am using xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g from 1 week on wards my experience about this mobile in simple words this mobile fantastic to me . Actual I use this mobile browsing , watching YouTube movies , playing games small such as Cand crush , temple run . I suggest the guys who want to purchase this mobile better to use like professional purpose , because it ' s light weight phone and slim to . It gives better performance . It can also use as daily lifestyle mobile , coming to the battery performance right now for me it ' s perfect , Because I use this mobile as professional use . But I think if you ' re the player in the games such as big games like " PUBG " . I better suggest you choose bigger battery mobile . Thank you : )####[['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'positive'], ['battery performance', 'positive']]
This phone from Xiaomi 5G series is a excellent choice in terms of powerful performance . As the name suggests Xiaomi Lite NE 5G is solid in terms of design and features . The 64MP camera quality is simply stunning and exceptional .  The slimmest phone does the grand work when it comes to producing Dolby vision out of videos . The pictures seem larger than life in HD and add pure magic to absorb the visual elegance . All in all this phone provides all the pleasure in perfect ways to ride the experience of performance in cool avatar .####[['Xiaomi Lite NE 5G', 'positive'], ['64MP camera', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
1 . Great value for value 2 . Excellent phone slim and trim 3 . Rear camera is good in day light but in night camera doesn ' t perform well 4 . I don ' t like it ' s front camera it gives yellowish tint on my face . I have heard of gcam so I downloaded and installed it . The quality of image for selfies are far better than stock camera , I will recommend to use gcam for selfie . 5 . Battery backup is decent but this phone charges very quickly . 6 . Many people doesn ' t like miui interface but in my experience it is to good there are to many added features because of miui , yes it sometimes lags because of that but i am ok with it . 7 . Display quality is like of flagship phone . Beast in the industry . Only missing feature is on 120hz refresh rate . 8 .

Slim and weightless compared to all phone available . 90hz refresh rate is more than enough for those who are not in to heavy graphics games . And who are all not in games , this is an excellent choice which is a great value for money . One glitch for people who connect their phone to car Audio system for Android Auto or just thru USB , once you connect the phone to USB , the USB CONFIGERATION message would keep on flickering in the phone screen which will not allow to do anything untill you pull the USB off . After lot of googling , the only solution i could find is to use a less costly USB cable which does not supports quick charge . Understood XIAOMI doesn ' t care to sort this issue even lot of complaints to them . And so , if you are not in to connecting to Android Auto , music thru USB connection , this phone is an excellent choice with a luxurious look . Else , you will get irritated when u could not connect to your CAR music system .

Better not to choose it just for display . It really has a Black Crush Issue . But everything else is good especially its Design . Battery back is better than expected for 4250mah .

I am writing this review after using phone for around six months . In terms of looks and design , phone looks great . Using this phone has exposed the reality of hypes created by xiaomi to buy its somewhat useless product . Xiaomi advertised as 10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision support for Netflix but these are either not usable or not existing at all . Being a phone with Amoled Display , I was expecting it to be True ALWAYS ON DISPLAY as shown in other Amoled phones of brands such as Samsung , Oneplus , Realme but here again Xiaomi cheated us and it can remain only for 10 seconds . Moreover , Xiaomi boasts of several long exposure modes but modes such as Light painting , Starry sky , Star trails etc cannot be used without a tripod . Xiaomi should have clearly written this in the product description rather than highlighting these modes to make people buy the product . After all this experience , I am not going to buy this THIRD CLASS Chinese brand phone ever again .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['xiaomi', 'negative'], ['10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
There are white lines all over the display , when i am trying to put dark wallpaper , in contact app , phone dialer , basically anywhere there is grey or black background , so i have replaced the device i am hoping that this issue is only with my unit , this issue is very significant and visible , i have my finger crossed and hoping the new unit wont have this issue , rest the colors are very vibrant and display is very good in other cases , speakers are definitely great , battery is okay , works fine for a day , rest it would have been great if it was 4500mah battery , the design is really great , loved the back glass and texture , performance in day to day task is great but definitely not for gaming and i am kinda disappointed with it , cant even play genshin impact and this is not a budget device , so performance should have been better , pubg runs okay but frame drops , the phone is definitely not for gaming , but for a person who wants to consume media and day to day life it ' s great ! Finger print is good , and placement is also fine , dont have much complaints with the device but the issues i have mentioned are really problematic .####[['display', 'positive'], ['speakers', 'positive'], ['battery', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['performance', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['performance', 'negative'], ['display', 'negative'], ['Finger print', 'positive']]

However the displan has some bugs where black sesms greyish and dim black things in video are having no nights and it shows seprately . Its also called black crush issue .

After lot of search and reviews i purchased this mobile . Since I am using this mobile only for 3 days , i cannot put my full experience now . As of now camera performance is just ok and not as expected . Hope that camera performance will be improved by software updates by xioami . In my 3 days usage battery last for one day only on very moderate usage . Under heavy usage like shooting photos , videos , video streaming , little gaming , battery last for 4 to 5 hours only . Battery performance needs more optimization . Sound from speakers good . I felt little heating issues while charging , using cameras and sometimes playing videos .

This review is after using it for 6 months . The worst product on Amazon and probably Xiaomi is aware of this failure . All 4 stars and 5 stars on Amazon are not at all genuine and so are the paid reviews on you tube . Major pixellation and black crush issue is seen when streaming videos on Netflix or you tube or any other OTT platform . Camera is below par . This is biggest let down . Very unstable , just good looks otherwise pure dabba phone not worth even 15k . Please dont waste your hard earned money on this product . I have sold this dabba phone from Xiaomi and will never buy any xioami phone again . Indians are not to be fooled . Be careful guys and dont fall for cheap marketing gimmicks####[['Amazon', 'negative'], ['Xiaomi', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
The phone is beautiful and great to hold , especially with the thin profile . The screen is also decent and the cameras in the right lighting do take decent shots . But the core issue with this phone is the network issues , this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently . Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength , signal quality and signal type . I have tried Jio , Airtel & Vodafone in the last 9 months , all with similar issues but especially so with Jio . Being a phone , if it can ' t make calls reliably it ' s an abject failure . So I would rate ZERO but doing the least I can at one .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['cameras', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Display is poor and text is not clear . Phone just hangs even if you ' re just minimising an app by pressing the home button . 6GB RAM ( and RAM expansion ) is a joke as it only hangs and the moment you switch to an app it always reloads the data / page . Imagine trying to copy the OTP from a msg and when you go back to the page to enter it , it reloads ! Haven ' t seen a worse phone than this . Extremely poor RAM management . Typing / Keyboard isn ' t smooth , camera hangs everytime you open the camera app plus camera quality is poor , battery drains extremely fast , calling problems . My old phone works better than this . Their Customer Care is a joke , so good luck trying to get this faulty device exchanged . Final verdict - Avoid buying this . Go for anything else other than this phone .####[['Display', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'negative'], ['6GB RAM', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['RAM management', 'negative'], ['Typing / Keyboard', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['Customer Care', 'negative']]
It ' s almost 1 year and 8 months and the smartphone is working average . I do experience some crashes but ig I can bear that much in exchange of AMOLED screen and better camera + fast charging . I am using this smartphone for AMV and the softwares I use are Node Video and Alight motion which are sometimes the heaviest apps in my smartphone but I can get 1080p so it ' s ok . Overall great product for day to day use .####[['smartphone', 'neutral'], ['smartphone', 'negative'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['charging', 'positive'], ['smartphone', 'positive']]
Perfect phone for its price . Saw some bad reviews , but may I know do they expect a phone quality in this price range ? ? For the price it ' s a good phone with g95 processor and getting to play BGMI with extreme settings . I haven ' t got any sort of issue till now . Not that much of heating , but while gaming there will be heating obviously . . . Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera . What else should we get in this price . Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly , Amoled display . Idk why some people expect more front his device .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['g95 processor', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint sensor', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]

I purchased this phone for my father and he is very happy with it . He has motibindu the amoled display is great for it plus it has ip57 rating 5000mh battery it easy last 2 and half day so you know his usage . And 33w charger is excellent in an hour it full charges . Camera is great but he rarely takes photos he uses ultra wide only . MIUI is fine I have disable all the ads and finally no bloatware in the phone out of the box so it is great news . Only issue is software update if redmi fix it then I have no problem with MIUI . I wanted to switch him to samsung but he is used to MIUI . But it was difficult to adjust for it so I made decision to stick with MIUI .####[['5000mh battery', 'positive'], ['amoled display', 'positive'], ['33w charger', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'negative']]
Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long . I would charge it in the morning at 90 % , and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80 - 85 % . But if I use it heavily on phone calls , Netflix , Brave , Youtube , etc . then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20 - 30 % . This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great . I would charge my phone for give or take 30 - 40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10 - 20 % to 90 - 100 . Fingerprint scanner works quite well . Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people . Sound quality of the stereo is really good . Quite loud and doesn ' t crack on full volume . The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point . I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected . It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone " head " first in and out of my pocket when listening to music .####[['Battery', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint scanner', 'positive'], ['Sound quality', 'positive'], ['stereo', 'positive'], ['earphone jack', 'positive']]
Good phone at this price range . If you need a smart phone for its smart features for using it for studies or communication or professional / personal communication . This is a great one . The location of the fingerprint scanner ( on the power button ) is not ideal if you are a left handed person or if the phone is fixed on a mobile stand or a car phone holder . Not a negative but point to remember that there is no NFC or wireless charging feature####[['smart phone', 'positive'], ['fingerprint scanner', 'negative']]
The phone is really good and great value for money , easy to use and quite legible . Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom . She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows , the screen looks big and phone looks very premium . Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well . The only issue is the speakers , they could have been louder . Considering my mom watches lot of video on this , the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music , I am sure that is not good for the speaker . Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone . Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics , not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['finger print sensor', 'positive'], ['speakers', 'negative'], ['Cameras', 'positive']]
I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews . However took a decision to buy and try . Phone is worthy every penny . I got it around 13k . Great battery , works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day . Didn ' t try gaming . Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers . Refresh rate is also good . No lags . I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues . Best budget phone . All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k . General users can simply go for it . I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['64mp camera', 'positive'], ['dual speakers', 'positive'], ['Refresh rate', 'positive']]
The phone was hyped so much during launch . It is similar to ordinary mi phones . If you are searching a gaming phone , don ' t go for this . . After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also . The phone us having issues during software updates . My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working . Lost all my data . . The camera is normal similar to other phone camera . There is nothing like 64mp . The photos are ordinary .####[['camera', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['software update', 'negative']]
I bought it in 14999 / but in offline stores , it is easily available in 14000 . Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls . Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11 . Camera of this phone is below average , as usual in case of Xiomi . If you ' re purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks , simple go for samsung . Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays ( xiomi was never in the race ) . It may look like less in weight but don ' t go with the sight it is heavy af . Only good thing about this phone is fast charging . If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone . I repeat never buy fkn Redmi , it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years .####[['Android 11', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['Xiomi', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['charging', 'positive']]
Firstly , the phone is in this price range is awesome with sAmoled display . Display quality is very good but less brighter than Samsung ' s amoled panels . I can ' t recommend you this phone for Pubg , COD gaming because after 15 min this phone was heating like an iron with remarkable frame drops but day to day use and it would be okay to use . I ' m not going to tell about bugs because it ' s MIUI ' s issue and will be solve with update . But battery is not like 5000 mAh , its display and android system is consuming too much brightness . Camera is good but sometimes colour is gone fade but you can use google camera for good portraits and to taking natural colour images ( here some clicks I have taken ) . By the way , its my honest review after using 8 days . You must buy this according to your criteria . But Xiaomi should cake immediate steps to solve these problems especially bettery , bugs , lagging and heating issues . Then we can prodly say it ' s the best phone under 12k .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Xiaomi', 'negative']]
Got this phone bacause of 2 main reasons over narzo 30 5g , one is good design , looks and display , second is IP53 rating . . . Almost satisfied except battery life and software issues . . . Battery draining very fast , and google chrome is not working well , crashing ever time I use google search , heavy notifications from miui . . Disappointed for these . . . Overall if you are concerned about 5g future ready , fastness in processor just avoid it . . Else ok to buy and install other browsers and bear with notifications , I m not talking about camera . . For this price range in any phone we won ' t get good camera , for 10s also it is not good , but I don ' t use camera often and not concerned about it . .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
I don ' t understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it ' s not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn ' t expect this from this phone . . Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product I don ' t know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone . Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone . . 64 mp . . It ' s picture quality is like 8 mp . . .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['selfie camera', 'negative'], ['back camera', 'negative'], ['amazone', 'negative']]
If anyone want to buy this phone , let me clearly tell you that camera quality is worst . I bought and cant even comparing camera quality to any other same range smartphone . Look wise its ok , battery life is also 18 hour if use continue . Screen is good , sometime hang issue occurs . In terms of other features , its average phone . But if anyone wants to take good quality photo or video , then its not worth to invest in this phone .####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'positive'], ['phone', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Phone is slow to read memory card and also to access camera . While open the camera , you may ashamed off infront of a group of people bcz of slow . I won ' t suggest to my friends . Display and main camera are good . Front protection glass is poor quality . Battery ok . Macro not good as expected . Compared to my 6years old Lenovo k4note ( dual Dolby speakers ) sound quality and speed also NOT impressed me . I hope a 1gb ram sufficient for our daily use except game , but this 4gb struggle to do our needs bcz of third party Mi User Interface disturbance .

Phone Brightness , is very bad , I have using always with full brightness , and Dual speaker both sides are working , but it is not louder than my previous single speaker mobile which is also mi Note 5 pro . Now a days mobile companies are not giving us proper quality of the mobiles as they sucked our money , they wanted us to do keep on buying new mobiles often . All are doing business tricks to use , india fast charging , India ' s first processor . They don ' t want to keep the Best Name Standard Mobile , quality of the products , in the market , they only aim is to suck the money , becoz it just buisness nothing personal .####[['Brightness', 'negative'], ['Dual speaker', 'neutral'], ['Dual speaker', 'negative'], ['companies', 'negative']]
This Mobile phone is Defective , there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware . it had heating Problem , hang issue and , not working properly . After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem , I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating . The YouTube application is not working , it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again . Many times , the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work .####[['Mobile', 'negative'], ['Hardware', 'negative'], ['Software', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative']]
Writing this review almost after 1 . 5 year of buying this phone . Becauss This is the worst mobile experience I ever had , it hangs toooo toooo much . It is hanging right from day one , It hangs even while receiving a call , opening any application or doing anything , I don ' t know why this is happened but I bought this phone because earlier I had good experience of using redmi phones . I must also mention camera quality is very good , but basic functioning and processor of this mobile is worst ever .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['redmi', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['processor', 'negative'], ['basic functioning', 'negative']]
I bought this product thinking so that it will sum up all the things the display is very much clear and pleasant you can get all the colours even in sunlight but the thing here I was the disappointed with the camera the cameras are not very cool the front camera is specially it ' s not of worthy even when you take a selfie the sky colour is blue it will make it as a white colour where is in the rear camera the bokeh effect ( potrait ) can ' t be seen , if two persons are standing near by it will make only first person cleared the rest of other unclear the battry was quite good and the phone heating problem was not an issue design is elegant phone look premium 1 , but the only thing which should all be looking to it ' s the camera quality the can give to camera in note 10 but they can ' t give a good camera in note 10s this is one of the cons which are not understood and I return this product and one more thing which I like to tell is that it ' s as refresh rate 60 hz but it ' s not performing as same so there is a jitteriness falling in the the screen .####[['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['rear camera', 'negative'], ['battry', 'positive'], ['note 10s', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['note 10s', 'negative'], ['display', 'negative']]
My experience with this phone was nightmare . This phone have lots of issues like phone get Rebooting and again sometime 2 times in one hour , camera take black and white images and that too can ' t be opened . Error keeps coming that file is corrupted . It was on reboot loop for almost 15 hours . I have given my phone to service center 3 times under warranty . problems don ' t get resolved 2 times and I ' m thinking to sell this phone rather giving it again to service center as i lost all my data . Due to sudden reboot loop i didn ' t get any time to back up####[['phone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['service center', 'neutral'], ['service center', 'negative']]
I bought the 6 / 128 GB version . It ' s working quite well . I ' ve too many apps installed , up and running , but it ' s still performing smooth . The primary camera also takes some good pictures . The display is quite natural , unlike those devices which show oversaturated colours . The charger is also of good quality . Two years OS upgrade and 4 years Security updates are also promised , let ' s see whether they deliver .

It served the purpose for which I purchased this phone . I was looking for a phone that is 5G ready , and after a few searches , I got a recommendation for this product . Everything is ok except the camera . The camera quality is not good , but it didn ' t bother me as I rarely use it .

There are other good options out there , but I prefer Samsung any day .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['performance', 'positive']]
Its a nicely designed phone . camera quality is garbage touch is alright . heating issues as all samsung phones have . still considering the price range and other features that comes with the phone .

Lot of apps are not compatible . I am surprised . I know the phone is cheaper and the expectations should be accordingly but I never thought that it will have restrictions on the app ' s .

Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good ! Reviews . But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast . This phone is an example .

Had a display issue and screen lag immediately within the first week , but the return window expired , can ' t get a replacement told amazon customer care , forced to take it to the Samsung Service centre they got the phone and asked me to wait a minimum of 20 days or more to get the display fixed to cover it under warranty . no options . even a new release phone doesn ' t have a spare for India ' s leading market share mobile company .####[['screen', 'negative'], ['amazon customer care', 'negative'], ['Samsung Service centre', 'negative']]

The battery gets heated fast in 10 mins while running any application The connective problem , voice disturbance . Network showing 2 - 3 lines the , the person gets out of network record .

This is the best one for gaming , best phone under 12000 . But the camera filter is not so good , but also I ' m happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi , gta , critical strike and many games at a time , and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay .

Its big memory 13GB & 128GB storage keeps all my things intact .

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device . Wish i had gone with poco , the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues . And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates . Plus you got to stick with booring hios .####[['hios', 'negative'], ['rom', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
If you are taking it for gaming then look at another phone because everything is good in this phone but the display is not right .

When this is a camera highlighted phone , the camera should have been far better . The camera does not capture good shot at all , in the case of moving objects it can not get much worse than this phone . The back of the orange one is getting heavily dirtier . Because of accidental touch sensibility the screen gets awake which is very much disturbing . I had to resell this phone with a loss of 14k after using for 1 & 1 / 2 month as the brand does not have much brand value in the market .

Let me start with positive . The only thing you will like in this phone is memory and that ' s it . Camera picture quality is average . Touch is average . Now , negative . Battery backup is poor . Even when you put single jio sim battery lasts for couple of hours . If you use social media apps it will drain within hour . OS is slow . Screen size is small in this prize range .

I am a traveller and often go on long treks and hence wanted a durable phone that also had long lasting battery life . I was going on a trek and the C11 is the only phone i took with me and i have to say i was very very impressed especially with the battery life . Generally during trek we don ' t get much access to plug ports hence i wanted a long battery life and the phone gave me just that , and when i turned on power saving mode was the best , this one week , i ran the phone without charging for 4 days .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
Have been looking for a phone to start online classes for my children , was looking for something afforable but also something that can do daily work very well and can play some games also . The C11 was a complete surprise , because i have been looking for some time and couldn ' t quite find a good fit , but after i saw the C11 2021 , i thought it would be great and after using for about 2 weeks , my children are very happy with it . And due to the low cost i was able to buy two for an affordable price and still get good performance .####[['C11', 'positive']]
Have been looking for a phone for my parents and my aunt at my hometown and wanted an affordable and good option .

The touch is also very good and easy to use daily . The display also i didn ' t expect to be this good , but it is truly great . For this price i would say it is very difficult to find a better phone with better performance and display .####[['android', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive'], ['touch', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Its been almost 1month , and I use this for daily purpose . Sometimes feels lag , and does not shutdown or restart properly , gets hanged in the middle of important task . It does not have fingerprint unlock option , instead it has very good face unlock option which detects and unlocks in the dim light also . There is no complain about the storage and the battery life is awesome .####[['face unlock', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['storage', 'positive'], ['ingerprint unlock option', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
All smartphone features working as per the budget . Can be a good first smart phone for elderly switching from basic mobile to smart phone . For sure features are not as good as 12 - 13k phone but for this budget good enough . So if budget permits go for 12k + phone with same features but better performance . Missing finger print scanner is the feature I feel would have made this more worthy as face scan works less than 50 % of the time . Battery lasts more than a day with moderate use . Processor and memory average .####[['smartphone', 'positive'], ['finger print scanner', 'negative'], ['face scan', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['Processor', 'neutral'], ['memory', 'neutral']]
If someone is calling to my number on the phone it used to rejected automatically , Initially , i thought it was my network issue , i tried with some other SIM and found this is mobile problem . Thus its really disappointing as the person call you feels you are deliberately cutting the call but you are not even getting notified that somone is calling you .####[['calling', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Although this product I buied from outside retailer on urgent need , the phone is quality worst at such price , instead redmi offers best quality phone at same price , and I am using redmi phone since 2 years , No network speed indicator , camera quality is very poor for selfi and long shots and no beauty mode , pictures pixels gets muddy effects no pre installed gallery , no private mode , battery is not so good . Abd Realme c11 2021 is worst to user and not value for money , go edition doest not have the latest os upgrade and poor user experience . Pls remove this product from the site realmi not making the consumer effective phones at low price , I never chose Realme phone and never advise .####[['Realme c11 2021', 'negative'], ['Realme c11 2021', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['go edition', 'negative'], ['Realme', 'negative']]
I ordered this phone and after 5 - 6 days it started lagging . The camera quality is also not so good as well as I can ' t do many things in this phone because it ' s not meant for all the AI and other functions too . Very much poor than other mobile phones , i would suggest you all to just a buy some other phone , all you have to do is add some 50 - 60 thousand rupees in this phone ' s cost and buy an iPhone .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative']]
I just got the phone today and experienced an unexpected event today . The phone was fine , nothing special about it . I just plugged the charger on the switch board and when I pressed the switch on , suddenly the charger got shot and spark came with it . My entire house got shot circuit and damaged the beaker . Seriously don ' t know what is wrong with charger and don ' t know what to do with the phone which has no charger . I don ' t recommend this phone due to its charger , it sucks .####[['phone', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Best iPhone from Apple . Display , camera , video quality is top notch . Any other mobile can’t match up to iPhone 14 pro max . AOD is slightly brighter which will drain phone battery by 7 % over night . Epic battery performance . Better to disable AOD until it gets fixed by any new update . Rest all features of the mobile is top class . Dynamic field notification is classy . Main disappointment we need to wait till end of December to get the iOS software update for 5G connectivity .####[['video quality', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['iPhone 14 pro max', 'positive'], ['battery performance', 'positive'], ['iOS software update', 'negative']]
Worth is subjective and differs from person to person . I’m not sure why everyone keeps comparing this to previous year iPhone as normal people usually upgrade from 2 or 3 generations . I’m upgrading from iPhone 11 Pro and I have plenty to like on the phone . The camera , the display , 120hz refresh rate and dynamic island . Overall it’s a worthy upgrade for me .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['iPhone 11 Pro', 'positive']]
I like the delivery on time and this new iphone is very improved and has better build quality and on hand feel is very good , if you are buying it for camera , then there nothing changed in iPhone 13 and iphone 14 , both cameras are same but if you want features than you should go with iPhone 14 , it has many new features and improved features , overall mobile is good####[['iPhone 14', 'positive']]
As always , samsung disappointed me again , i purchased this phone because of the new processor which had scored 4 lakh + in antutu . But it doesnt work well , camera is very bad , bezzels are really big , and due to its thickness if i put back cover on it becomes really bulky . I wont suggest anyone to buy this . It lags in small games , 90fps but still my 3 years old device runs better than this####[['processor', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Slow motion video making is missing and screen comes with 90hz refresh rate and photo editing in which we can remove anything is missing while samsung galaxy m33 comes with more feature than this a14 at a lower price so what ' s the point of raising the price and cutting the features .

Don ' t take this mobile if you intend to use the hotspot feature . The other devices you connect to it will lose connection so often that it is frustrating . Every half an hour you will need to switch off and switch on the hotspot . Battery barely lasts 6 - 8 hours with hotspot and 12 - 14 hours otherwise . Call quality , touch are good .

I dont know why one or other tech youtuber is complaining about oxygen OS , frankly speaking , awesome clean user interface , fluid OS , gaming is beast in OP 10T , camera is good but not superb but still very good in this price bracket , gets super charged in just 14 mins from 1to100 % , battery performance is tooo good doesn ' t drain like other phones , after 1 hour of heavy gaming it only drains about 8 to 10 % , Genshin Impact runs like a beast in ultra settings , stereo speakers output is gr8 very crisp , loud n clear .

Hello all , I ' ve been using this phone for past couple of days . It ' s an excellent phone to use with . Performance is fantastic followed by the battery life . I ' m not a core gamer , I am getting battery life of 48 hours . User interface is excellent , the processor is super fine . The camera isn ' t splendid , however does the job . Overall it ' s a very good performance driven phone , which fulfils the daily need . Kudos to the 160 W charger , it charges the phone in 15 minutes . I ' m enjoying it . My recommendation is very simple , if you seriously want to spend 50k for a phone then go for it , otherwise look for affordable options .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Performance', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['User interface', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['160 W charger', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]

I have been a royal one plus customer , started with One plus 3T . My last phone was One plus 8T , though I missed the alert slider for 2 days . . . now i got used to it so it was not a big con for me . The major uplift from 8T was charging time 100percent in 20mins . . . was mindblown and then a good level up in the camera segment too . Was little hesitant about the phone back panel , but in hand it looks gorgeous with curved camera segment and a premium finish . Was impressed when One plus gave me a 160W charger in box unlike IPhone ( Pun intended ) , and also a jade green silicone back cover which I ' m currently using due to unavailability of cover due to new model release . Applications are opening blazing fast and no heating issues when I played Asphalt and PUBG mobile . Overall happy with the product and a decent upgrade from my previous mobile .####[['charging', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['back panel', 'positive'], ['Applications', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Everything is but bgmi game lacks in frame drops in this device maybe it ' s due to its ban in India as of my thoughts and I have noticed that like all the flagship this mobile is getting some what heat after using for continuously for even 30mins but compared to all flagship mobile brands it is heating 50 % less over all a performance beast with a superb charger Main Camera sensor is at its best regarding that two other cams were not up to the mark and Stereo Speakers were best but not as best as Harmon kardon speakers of Xiamoi mobile .####[['Stereo Speakers', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'positive'], ['charger', 'positive']]
A rare combination of high - end specs delivering a stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS . I was not expecting such a blistering performance from an Android device . Although there are few compromises on the hardware front such as removal of alert slider button , it ' s certainly not a deal breaker . The design of the phone is not pathbreaking , but actually could differentiate from other me - too phones . The unique camera setup helps to differentiate this phone with others . It ' s a kind of proprietary design for One Plus 10 series . The photos come good if not excellent . I could buy it at 36k with ICICI bank CC offer , combined with an exchange . At 36k it ' s a steal for sure . If you are looking for a real fast phone , has a decent 6 . 7 inch - 120 Hz screen , a unique look to flaunt , One Plus 10T presents itself as a worthy option to consider .####[['One Plus 10T', 'positive'], ['hardware', 'negative'], ['One Plus 10T', 'neutral'], ['camera setup', 'positive'], ['photos', 'neutral'], ['screen', 'positive']]
It is a decent phone . Battery discharge quickly and you have to charge it . it takes just 10 to 15 mins to charge . Thanks to super voc 150w adapter . Camera is good but some times the result is blurry images . Heating when you use Snapchat or camera after 5 mins of use . Phone case is good but glassie finish is no use when it is with covered with phone case . Keyboard is overlapping when you open WhatsApp chat . . .

Display , battery , charging and gaming is great on this . Camera is good not great , but takes good enough photos on main camera . Gaming is great , i played BGMI in max settings for more than 2 hours never got above 39°C and cools down pretty fast . Alert slider is a major missing coming from OP7 , Oxygen OS is color OS with fast and clean UI . No bugs or lags ever faced .

The product is good . however , te macro lens of 2mp is really a waste . One going for 16gb ram , please either go for OnePlus 10 pro or oneplus 11 .

didn ' t expect this from one plus . After one month of use the phone started showing some issues mostly in network issue and always having a issue while the time of attending phone calls . Every time when I get a phone call if I accept the call the opposite person cannot hear me either he needs to call me again or else I should call him it is happening every time . And the phone screen stucks sometimes for 10 to 20 seconds . Really pathetic phone . I won ' t recommend to anyone####[['phone', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative']]

I have used OnePlus x and OnePlus 5 before and enjoyed them both . . . my OnePlus 5 lasted me for 4 . 5 years . . . brought the phone on launch date . . . . went in expecting good experience and was fooled . Though the battery and camera are undoubtedly better , the phone is not even able to run YouTube w / o glitches . If I try and exit before video ends , the app over app or even normal version freezes up . And nothing works except for a phone restart . And this is not just for YouTube . . . amazon prime video and other streaming apps play so glitchily . . . . Every day I ' m having to restart atleast twice . Worst phone .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['app', 'negative']]
Dislike - UI , performance , speed , API function , all in all not worthwhile Not at all worth if we talk about the performance .

OnePlus 10T is inferior to OnePlus 5T which I used for more than 3 years with not even a single hand issue or lag in performance . . .

Redmi Note 4 is overall a very good android phone . It has a good battery life - 4100 mAh , and it is lasts close to a whole day without requiring to charge frequently . Using the phone is very smooth as it has up to a 4GB RAM . It does not slow down even if many applications are open . It has speaker grilles that are placed at the bottom , and the sound quality of the phone is impressive too . It has a 13MP camera , and the photos turn out great . It has a 64GB storage , which is a sufficient capacity . It has a warranty of 1 year for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in - box accessories from the date of purchase .

Upgraded from my Mi4i to Note 4 , and so it was familiar terrain ! As always , with the 4GB RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage , it was huge leap forwards in online actions and applications . The touch sensitivity is excellent and the camera remains a strong feature for me . The only negatives I felt were an element of heating on continuous use and longer battery charging time . Overall , for me , a total value for money piece , considering that it was combined with an exchange offer plus cash discount on card - truly " Price Less " ! !####[['touch', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Note 4', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['Note 4', 'positive']]
Redmi Note 4 remains a very popular obile phone and was the most popular in 2017 . However with the passage of time the front camera need update and the software becomes slow . The primary problem with such Chinese origin phones is their reluctance to learn from Apple . The hardware remains an issue and these phones are primarily targetting the Lower Middle Class segment who constitute the bulk of Mobile set consumers in India at present . Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi must develop in this aspect .####[['Redmi Note 4', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative'], ['hardware', 'negative']]

Its a good device to buy under 10 k . Was worried about its built quality before buying it but found it worthy . Giving 5 star for its performance and for buity quality .

This is the best one for gaming , best phone under 12000 . But the camera filter is not so good , but also I ' m happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi , gta , critical strike and many games at a time , and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay .

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device . Wish i had gone with poco , the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues . And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates .

Now I want to tell you that this phone has lot of features like very good battery backup fast charging increased Ram increase the storage Expendable memory hybrid card slot dual speakers stereo sound crystal clear voice punchhole camera amoled screen amoled screen very high resolution very nice display most important is the phone is very fast because it has very good microprocessor and very good GPU . So a very good purchase very good phone .

The phone looks good . Only thing is the matte back cover which hold smudges , I have polar white variant of 11 s which reflects multiple colors . Camera quality is awesome in 108 mp mode and normal mode in adequate light . Low light camera is average to good . Other than that performance is quite impressive . Works well in 6 gb ram and even better in + 2gb virtual ram . Quite great choice for a budget smartphone####[['smartphone', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Low light camera', 'positive'], ['6 gb ram', 'positive'], ['+ 2gb virtual ram', 'positive']]
Review after several days use . It ' s really nice phone . Back camera is really awesome . Front camera / Battery backup is good . Display is awesome . Touch and Feel is also so nice . Only few thing like macro camera not useful , one speaker is not loud . But both speaker delievers good quality . Battery backup should have slightly more . It ' s last 1 day if we use average + 4 - 5 hours of video watching . So I feel it ' s really worth buying####[['phone', 'positive'], ['Back camera', 'positive'], ['Front camera', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['macro camera', 'negative'], ['one speaker', 'negative'], ['both speaker', 'positive'], ['phone', 'neutral']]
But 5G is needed because most of the mobiles come in 5G under 15k . So who don ' t want 5g you can go to this . But overheating is more when heavy apps are used . Display is very good . Amoled screen works good . Camera outstanding . Selfie camera goes good and takes outstanding photos .####[['mobiles', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['Amoled screen', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Selfie camera', 'positive']]
Decent Camera and it is slightly better than Redmi note 9 pro Max but the Mobile design is not as good as expected so overall good phone but the design could have been more better . Performance is good and good battery performance . Even Display I don ' t found as good as Realme Phone .####[['Camera', 'neutral'], ['Mobile', 'negative'], ['Mobile', 'positive'], ['battery performance', 'positive']]
Don ' t buy this phone . There are better One plus phones or other model phones with very good camera . This is not as good as expected . Pics of 32MP of a few other phones are better than pics taken in this 108MP . Pics taken at low light is also extremely worst . Please avoid this phone if your primary preference is camera . Battery life is good . But it ' s of no use if camera is extremely worst .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'positive']]
1 . Dual speakers are not giving overall good quality sound . Only one speaker is working properly , the other one is having very low sound as compared with first one . 2 . While on call , voice is not coming properly which creates problem to listen the conversation . 3 . also , speaker and hold options during call are lagging for 2 seconds if applied . 4 . 108 MP camera is not giving such amazing pictures . when zoomed , pictures get blur . image quality is same as 64 MP camera . 5 . battery backup is also not worthy .####[['Dual speakers', 'negative'], ['Dual speakers', 'positive'], ['call', 'negative'], ['108 MP camera', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'negative']]
Using this from 7 days now ( 8gb 128gb variant , black ) Like : good refresh rate , display is nice , camera is average , ram 8gb plus booster 3gb available , charges quickly around 40mins full charge , no heating issues . Dislike : the phone sound system is extremely low , it ' s speaker seems so less in volume . My redmi note 7 pro has got better speaker than this . Despite giving full volume I can hardly hear the ringtone a room apart , if I place this phone in full volume in my bag I cannot hear the ring even a bit , same is the case with alarm tone , speaker during the call . Really bad one . I gifted a redmi 9activ to my househelp , her phone speaker works 100 times better than this .####[['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['charges', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['sound system', 'negative'], ['speaker', 'negative']]
The product comes with lots of promises . While it certainly has good functional features , in terms of camera and battery life , the manufacturer have compromised a lot in terms of durability . Its highly fragile and comes with high risk of screen damage with slightest of shock or fall . Worst part , since its a new model , the service team does not even have spare parts to fix the same . I am having horrible experience in getting the screen replaced which is already delayed by a week now which has never been the case with Samsung . Overall this is a learning for me NOT to go for any budget model specially from Redmi . . .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['Samsung', 'negative']]
I purchased this phone at price of 17000 but its worst in segment low picture quality and camera quality don ' t fall for 108 megapixel camera . It ' s Sensor is worst . Also it ' s speaker is so slow and stereo speakers are just for decoration no use of it . Call voice is also very low . Overall this phone is just a waste from Xiaomi####[['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['Sensor', 'negative'], ['speaker', 'negative'], ['stereo speakers', 'negative'], ['Call voice', 'negative']]
Very pathetic camera . Over heating outdoor in the normal Indian temperature . I have captured the video with my another phone outside the service centre . After they gave me an advice that i must use the phone inside the house when AC is on . As well as keep the Wi - Fi , and other options off while using the phone camera . Service center will not solve your problem . I got it back . I shoot the video in front of the service centre . It was about 11 o ' clock morning , normal temperature around 35 degrees .  It ' s completely waste of money . My old Motorola working fine . No such issues . But this one is garbage . I won ' t recommend anyone to by this phone . Even redmi Xiaomi has same heating issues in other models .####[['camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
If you need an iOS device at low price , go for it . For camera freaks not recommended if you are into telephoto clicks because it doesn ' t have a telephoto lens . But best in its class . I do remember it had the best camera after after pixel 2 xl and huawei p30 pro . Good battery life . Gets you through the day with moderate use but do buy a 20 w charger . Ahead of times processor , no question about that . Screen goes upto 1080p 60hz , not recommended if you use a 120 / 90hz device already , you will get stuck at slow motion . nice speakers if you still listen to music on speaker . . . it has that iconic punch of a little base that every iPhone has . But I do recommend to go for the higher variants if not necessarily an emergency to have an iOS device . If you are okay with an android device I do recommend comparing it with others like OnePlus , samsung , nothing etc , once .####[['camera freaks', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'negative'], ['speakers', 'positive']]
जब आप अपने हाथ में iPhone पकड़ते हैं तो यह वास्तव में एक प्रीमियम अहसास होता है और मुझे यह पसंद है। कैमरा एकमात्र निराशा है कुल मिलाकर कम बैटरी क्षमता, यदि आप एक Android उपयोगकर्ता हैं और iPhone से iPhone 11 पर स्विच कर रहे हैं, तो आपको चिप A13 बायोनिक में नाइट मोड और डुअल कैमरा शक्तिशाली मिलेगा। यदि आपसे पूछा जाए कि क्या iPhone 11 2022 में उपयोगी है तो मेरा उत्तर बहुत उपयोगी है क्योंकि भारत में इस साल 5G नहीं आ रहा है और यदि आपका बजट ज्यादा समस्या नहीं है तो आपको iPhone 4G खरीदने के लिए लंबा इंतजार करना होगा। iphone 12 के लिए जाएं क्योंकि iphone 12 2022 में पैसे के लिए सबसे अच्छा मूल्य प्रदान करता है। यह मेरी राय है धन्यवाद####[]
I have used iPhone 11 since 3month It gives me a smooth experience with beautiful premium feel and good Camera quality . iPhone 11 runs one day very easily ( I’m a medium to moderate user ) . A13 Bionic chip works very well in gaming multi tasking and it’s also power efficiency . I had an android phone user , but I hade ipad since 3 years ( Not new in iOS ) . I have purchased it in sale around 39k price .  You can go for iPhone 12 for getting a beautiful display experience . iPhone 11 display not bad , it beats with 25k flagship android display .####[['iPhone 11', 'positive'], ['Camera quality', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive'], ['A13 Bionic chip', 'positive']]
As for now It is a best value for money iPhone . If you want to experience iphone with a modern looks you should go for this . If camera is not your number one priority then it will be a good choice for you . Dont get me wrong . Camera of iPhone xr is good enough but you will not get wide angle shots so if potrait and wide angle shots are your priority then go for iPhone 11 instead . Battery life is good and give me a good battery life for a day . I can say if your budget is tight and around 30 to 35k only then go for this .####[['iPhone xr', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'positive']]
This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get ( Bought in amazon sale ) for this price . I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving . Think twice if you’re making switch from android , coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations . Man you’ll feel android is cheap ( except oxygen and pure android ) , that fluidity , damn the haptic motor ( sucks in most of androids ) . Here comes the big surprise for me , the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except . It gives you 1 and half to two days of normal usage . It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast . Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated . Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you’ll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome . Will update after six months .####[['Battery” backup', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
iPhones are the most premium mobile devices money can buy . If u have a budget just go for it , You won’t regret it . Coming to iPhone 11 it’s the most affordable of the lot and feels really premium . Though it’s not 5G but it doesn’t matter 5G won’t be coming anytime soon and even if it comes it would be very expensive so one can easily go for it . Coming to the lcd screen trust me won’t notice any difference it’s Apple quality LCD and the company would not compromise on quality . Camera is best especially in the low light performance is really impressive . And coming to the battery life it’s really impressive on moderate uses u can easily get 8 + hours of screen on time .####[['iPhone 11', 'positive'], ['lcd screen', 'positive'], ['Apple', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive']]
Amazing phone but as the other reviews say , yes it has heating issues but you won’t get to know if you have a thick back cover . Battery life is average , not too good not too bad .

Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed . . its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick , camera quality is top notch , battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'positive']]
Bought the iPhone few days . Actually after seeing the white colour I felt had to order different colour though , but it’s fine as long as ur using cover it doesn’t matter . Coming to looks it’s average as described earlier and battery back up is really good . Camera quality is just good no doubt in that . Very crisp , sharp and colours are defined well .

This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone . The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android . And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is . It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone . Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience , you can’t beat the iPhone . I say go for this phone without any hesitation .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Charging cable quality v poor . Battery is good but not for a whole busy day with all its features . Its terrible thing is , some heating issues while fast charging and heavy using but this could be managed .

Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this .

I bought this phone for my brother . He said that this product is getting heated a lot . He checked the serial number in Apple site and the product is genuine . I am using iPhone from iphone 3g almost 11 years . No issues like heat or anything else . I bought those phones from directly Apple US . He will check with Apple . Another guy is using 11 and no heat issue for him . I am not sure if this lot has issue . Will update once he sends it to the apple service center and get it back .####[['phone', 'negative']]
Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8 . It feels like degradation for me from bigger and more clear display to small LCD with no refresh rate . Major pain area is battery charging from 15mins of oneplus to hours for iPhone .

I don’t think the quality of phone is good . Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store . The phone hangs few times everyday . Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well .

This is amazing phone under 60k . Good display . And usage u won ' t get any lag . Funtouch os is good but need small improvements . Camera department is awesome . Selfie camera is good . I attached one file with back camera . Battery is good . Last 1 day for an moderate user . But for heavy users need to charge again in the evening . It becomes hot while charging and it takes 25 mins for full charge .  Overall it is agood phone under 60k with all flagship features . Better than high range samsung and iPhone in value for money . If u have that much high budget can go for big phones . Build is awesome .

i was bit hesitant since i read couple of reviews here . but then i thought to give a chance to myself to buy this try this out .

I am using this phone from 2 days . . Mobile was very good , smooth , Performance was good and best part is charging , finger print 1 . Os level I didn ' t felt any difference as I am using vivo before , Some Android 12 features are missing ( Colour Palette ) and more shortcuts , personalizations should be added 2 . Wide angle and potrait photos should be improved through software updates 3 . Camera Features are more in IQOO9 than Pro like long exposure , super night video , documents etc . . . Little disappointed 4 . IP68 rating was missing at this point ( If this is included best all - rounder phone in 2022 ) 5 .

The display is really good and the charging speed is also as advertised but the battery seems to be discharging quickly than expected . I charged it at 85 % and it discharged to 70 % by the end of the day on standby . The battery optimization could have been better . Also prime video didn ' t support 1080p playback initially , don ' t know if it was a bug or something , but it ' s working fine now .

The phone is great , super smooth , love the display . Charging is super quick . A great device . The trouble comes in the software , calls some times connect but there is no sound of the other person . The in display scanner sometimes just disappears and then you have to restart the phone .

Previously i had oppo find X2 which was 10x better than this . Battery lasts for long but can ' t use for long continuous .

There isn ' t a quick switch for data sim in the pull down which would be a better option . I should have choosen some other device . Low camera quality and worst clarity pictures .

I saw some reviews and purchased this . However the phone is good looking and has the latest 8gen processor , fast charging , battery charges in 10 to 15 mins sometimes .

I won ' t suggest anyone to buy this phone . I had seen many reviews before buying this but the price and performance didn ' t turnout to be reasonable .

With specs provided you shouldn ' t feel the lag while gaming but I warn you , you ' ll realise the heat decipated from back and which will lead to normal apps to malfunction .

I upgraded from iphone xs and I am pretty happy with it . The feature it provide are only present in iPhone pro models which are above 1 . 2 lakhs currently . The best thing is battery charging speed around 25 min for full charge and it can stay for 1 day normally . The screen resolution and adaptive refresh rate is also a plus . I am not a camera fan but it captures great night shots . With 4 years OS update and 5 years security update and wifi 7 update are the best things the company is offering . In Love with this mobile . Haptics are again next level and it provides support of Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos .

xcellent device for the price . I ' m writing this stubby review and will use it as a running log to report the good and bad about the device . Until now , the phone feels great ! Definitely feels like the old OnePlus of yore , and the good part , thankfully .  The handfeel is very good , it masks the weight and size of the device , designed quite well .  It ' s a joy to type on ( fabulous haptics ! ) .  The screen is really good .  The battery life seems to be holding up well ( using on qHD + 120hz ) .  It did heat up during the initial setup but calmed right down after a while . Not heatup up during normal usage . Did get warmish during a Super - Sus session ( not blazing hot , just warmish ) .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['haptics', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Apart from a couple of bugs that I noticed in my daily usage , this seems like an outstanding phone . Nothing that cannot go away with an OTA update or two . Charging speed is insane and battery life won ' t let you down . Camera is decent enough for clicking pictures . I am not into vlogging so I don ' t really bother about the front camera capabilities of not being able to record a 4K video . Sound is loud and crisp . UI is highly customisable and I keep it the way I like .

Overall the phone is good , battery is also excellent . But built quality I m unsure . . . as with the one plus cover on the handset the phone should be safe . . . but it just fell once from my hand and the back side panel got slight crack . . . I agree it ' s my fault . . . but I have been using one plus phones last 5 years . . . always used it roughly but it has great durability . . .  This time I m little upset .

I am using One Plus 11 from last one and half month , it has lots of issues as face unlock , finger print unlock some times it stop when scrolling the screen , camera quality is good . The worst this is its volume button has stuck in side and it is not working , its volume button has stopped working in online one and half month . Before One Plus 11 i was using One Plus 5 that was a great product of One Plus in compare of One Plus 11 . I had used One Plus 5 for 5 years and i was fully satisfied with that .

WhatsApp shows old messages instead of new ones , pointer speed ( touch sensitivity ) is confusing and not ideal ( too much makes you swipe back when you actually wanna swipe left ) . The phone hearing volume is very low compared to older models and other phones . Even Spotify . Sms app has a bug . Overall the phone has a great camera but the processor doesn ' t seem as fast it promises .

After couple of days after receiving the phone , the volume down button stops working and the lower part of the button went inside the phone and the day later the volume up button stopped working as well , I don ' t understand if it ' s the phone defected or it ' s the OnePlus build quality . If it ' s the OnePlus build quality that is dropped then surely OnePlus should improve a lot in that because I have been using 1 + 7 T from 3 years and I have never seen any issue with that and it had bent and shattered and still it works . So compared to that OnePlus seem dropped thier build quality .####[['volume down button', 'negative'], ['volume up button', 'negative'], ['OnePlus', 'negative']]
1 . Battery consumption is too much . 2 . Worse experience on google photos , youtube , games . As typical oneplus phone , all these apps will run on 60Hz refresh rate which is unacceptable with respect to price . 3 . Too much battery drain if 5g connection enabled . If you want a flagship experience smooth display , better spend more and get s23 because this 60hz refresh rate might give you headache .####[['Battery', 'negative'], ['apps', 'negative'], ['oneplus phone', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Pathetic camera experience . Photos and videos taken by oneplus 11 is over sharpened and also having unrealistic color processing by default photo app . Don ' t know what Hasselblad collaboration is actually delivering . I have been using oneplus 5 for last six years and a happy customer , but after buying oneplus 11 my expectation on oneplus phone has gone down . Even old oneplus 5 is taking much better photo / video than this high cost nonsense product . Today mobile phone is used for taking pictures and videos to capture great memories , and oneplus is failed to deliver satisfactory results . Those who are buying this phone for photography , then don ' t spend your valuable money for oneplus 11 , instead think for others .####[['camera', 'negative'], ['oneplus 11', 'negative'], ['oneplus', 'negative']]
I thought it would be a good phone for the next 3 to 5 years . But I am facing an issue with Wi - Fi connectivity . Even though it gets connected to Wi - Fi , the network activity is zero . Also facing issue with recording calls . I haven ' t tested the camera completely , but with the reviews that I read , looks like the camera set up is disappointing . Battery life is average , and with the fast charger , one can charge 0 % to 100 % in 20 mins , so the battery is not of a concern . Screen is not dazzling . But overall I am disappointed with the phone because of the Wi - Fi connectivity and recording calls .####[['Wi - Fi connectivity', 'negative'], ['recording calls', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'neutral'], ['fast charger', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Exchanged ONE PLUS 7T to buy this phone . If you are upgrading from lower version of OP to this one just because of camera , please dont . Its camera / video is of pathetic quality as comapred to OP 7T . Quality of Still photo and Video degraded over time .

The product delivers what it says and is completely worth the asking price of < 9k . Display , processor and storage are really good ( and fast 90hz & UFS 2 . 2 ) .

After using this phone for 3 days , I realised the phone is pretty good ok this segment under 10k . However , I totally understand that we can ' t expect a very good camera as somewhere the company needs to compromise . The camera is good during daylight but in night time there are grains . . I tried the pro mode and if you know it well you can use the same camera to reduce the grains . Also , gyroscope is not there so for PuBg people who plays it via gyro . . . . . it ' s a no no  Otherwise it ' s good in this series . . . .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['gyroscope', 'negative']]

Overall it ' s a good quality phone . The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil / moisture all over the box . But i guess it didn ' t affect the phone . I have been using it for over a week . The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it . Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note . My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps , and i send it over WhatsApp . . . the video gets compressed so much that it ' s laggy and unwatchable . Overall . .

Overall the phone is great with beautiful display great inhand feel great haptics . But the battery life in my 4 day usage is average . I don ' t know if this will be fixed via updates or not but till now it ' s not very good . I had a 4000 mah phone last and it lasted thr same as this maybe it ' s because of the processor or thr refresh rate but it should be improved via updates . Other than that the phone ' s really great and if you are an average user the battery will last the whole day easily so not so bad either . I don ' t use cameras that much so can ' t really comment on that but so far looks really good and the limited photos I have clicked have come out great . The couture blue color I bought looks premium and classy too but if you have the option go for the mauve one .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['haptics', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'neutral'], ['battery life', 'negative']]
It feels really good in hand . Fingerprint reader is a little slower than other phones . . . There is no fog issue till now . . . Battery life is quite good but the charging speed is really amazing .

Overall its an awesome phone , good camera , awesome display and overall design but the let down is the battery life . . . lasts only 4 - 5 hours with decent use . . so basically you ' ll have to charge it twice in a day . The other issue is heating . . . i know 8 gen 1 is known for heating but this phone heats even on using lighter apps like teams , insta . Xiaomi better provide some updates to improve all the mentioned issues and I ' ve received no updates so far even security patch is of march . . . this phone is Xiaomi ' s flagship , so I request them to treat it like one with frequent updates .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['8 gen 1', 'negative']]
I bought the cream version and it looks very premium . Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k . But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake . Coming to phone , the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT / 17 hrs in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel , chrome , and social media apps . Dont play games , so dont know the performance . But its buttery smooth . Outdoor brightness is exceptional . It is joy to watch videos on this on display . Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording . Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option , 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5 % to 1 % within like 5 mins .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Oneplus 11', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['charging', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'negative']]
Camera too good . Display is dope af . Feels super nice to hold . Flagship experience all around . One small con is the camera arrangement , one below the other , hand touches the cam sometimes , will get used to it in a few days , plus and ultra won ' t have this issue because the size is bigger I guess . Battery is just decent but still way better than s22 .  Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low , even in the morning . Could use night mode to get better pictures . Relies a lot on post processing of the image . Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on . Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better . In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing . 4k 60fps videos are too fiire , screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images . Ton of detail . Stabilization is excellent . Slo mo is fun too .####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'neutral'], ['Cam', 'negative'], ['Cam', 'positive']]

I liked almost every aspecf of this phone . It is premium , easy to hold considering the screen size , reminds me of iPhone 5s but that was smaller . Slick , swift and perfectly configured . I might say that this phone looks even better than some of the iPhonesin the market ( of course those are way more premium and well put together ) . I think Samsung got jt all right this time as the elegant flat back and a very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera and refresh rates and the chip . . display and camera have been the forte but they went one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive']]

Writing this review after 1 month of using this device . Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality , feels premium . Software experience has been good so far no bugs , smooth UI . The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup , it doesn ' t last whole day . Gives about 6 - 7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data . Battery performance could have been better as Samsung ' s mid - range phones are really good at battery backup . When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over - saturated , night mode pics are not that great feels over - exposed almost all the time .####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['Software', 'positive'], ['UI', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'negative'], ['Battery performance', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative']]
I bought it a week ago . . i upgraded from my oneplus 6 , I used that phone for 4 . 5 yrs . I was confused between oneplus 11 and samsung 23 , after thoroughly going through reviews from experts . I zeroed on this phone , . . I like the phone no doubt . The haptics are nice and UI is smooth . But i dont know why i m facing connectivity issues in this phone . Being a flagship phone , it should have better connectivity . . but it sucks . . websites do not open , both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug . I am unable to use internet , i have to constantly refresh and restart my device for better network . I am getting missed calls alerts via sms although mobile network shows full strength . .

I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother . I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon . Believe me it fabulous product so far . The screen is apt and very clear . Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc . Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material . Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space . Phone is quite light weight and very smart . I chose blue color and believe me it looks classy . Only issue it does not come with earphones I respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but I recommend this to all buyers . In nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too . Cheers####[['phone', 'positive'], ['screen', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['Memory', 'positive']]

The product is looking great , better than its photos available online . I have purchased this item because of its light weight ( 145gm ) sleek design and impact processor within budget . It has no fingerprint lock but the face recognize lock system is great even in the low light . Camera and display both are ok recommend for daily rough use . If you have some extra budget then I also recommend you to buy Redmi 5 or Redmi 7 . Redmi 6a is great for me because I use mobile 16hrs a day surfing google and its weight and design is absolutely perfect for me within low budget . However , almost every Android phone is ok for the fist 1 . 5 - 2years , afterthat you know what will happen to it .####[['Redmi 6a', 'positive'], ['processor', 'positive'], ['fingerprint lock', 'negative'], ['face recognize lock system', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive']]
Redmi 6A will be the best pick in the budget range . Other competitors can ' t give the features and quality which Redmi can give you at your hand and in a cheapest range . The best features of this phone is , its traditional looks and features . Battery life is also long lasting . So no doubt , you can go for it . I just have one issue with the packaging of the product by amazon . They have sent a plactic packet , I was shocked ! But no damage or physical harm have occured . I am happy with my new device !

Its a great product by xiaomi . It ' s affordable and durable . I have been using this product since last 3 years or more and it is still working . The camera is not upto the mark because it gives a bit blured pics in more light but overall the phone has all the features . The only feature I miss is the fingerprint . But compared to the pricing , this phone has pretty much every essential things .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['xiaomi', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['fingerprint', 'negative']]
Redmi has not worked on their camera for low light , hence picture quality at night stays poor . But picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price , the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well . It lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once . But I usually can play games seamlessly . The sound outlet is at the back . That is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed , it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones . Sound is okay , not very loud . Just fine and doable . Battery life could have been better , but if you ' re not online all day or playing video games for hours , changing once a day is more than enough . Biggest problem I ' ve faced is that the hotspot of this phone doesn ' t always work on my laptop . My laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots . All over , it ' s a good looking phone with sufficient qualities for this price point .####[['front camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['sound outlet', 'negative'], ['Sound', 'neutral'], ['Battery life', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
Love the phone . Everything on it works as expected . I ' ve been using this phone for about 1 weeks , and so far I ' m loving it . Here ' s me breakdown : The quality , fit and finish are amazing . No one believes this is low priced phone . Battery : exceptional battery life , the best in any smartphone I ' ve had so far . Build / design : one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I ' ve used , even compared to much more expensive models . Camera : not as good as my Honor 7C , but still takes good enough pictures that it ' s not really a problem for me .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'neutral'], ['quality', 'positive'], ['fit', 'positive'], ['finish', 'positive']]
The phone feels good in hand and quite handy compared to 18 : 9 phones . The battery backup is really good and lasts easily a day with light to normal usage . Screen is good and maybe best for price segment . Speakers are adequately loud but not that loud . Easily handled 1 - 3 apps at a time . And the camera is awesome with portrait mode only in FRONT camera . I have attached a image with with HDR on and other zoomed part of same image for image quality and idea about it . Gaming isn ' t expected for this phone and I don ' t judge it on gaming basis . No lag issue people just fill the phone will lot of apps and complain about lag which seems stupid . Minor lags are possible as RAM is 2gb . You get Oreo out of box and with miui 9 . 6 and 8 - 9 gb ROM available and Miui 10 update is available which is quite better features wise but has minor lags compared to Miui 9 . 6 .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['RAM', 'neutral'], ['Miui 10', 'positive'], ['Oreo', 'positive']]
Let me start off by telling you what this phone is not good at . Gaming . Games like PUBG and similar intensive games will lag inevitably . But the best thing about this phone is that this is the only negative about this device . Day to day performance is fine , call quality is great , camera is doable , battery life is amazing and even the build quality is not bad . At this price point , this phone provides a very satisfactory and pleasing experience . Sure it ' s not as good as more expensive phones , but it ' s not supposed to be . It ' s supposed to be the phone for everyone , which can do everything an average user would expect . Must buy if you ' re looking to buy a smartphone at this price point .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['battery life', 'positive'], ['phone', 'neutral']]
Hello to everyone , I have bought this phone on 3rd December 2018 . I want a phone which is easy to hold , easy to use and also cheap in price . I also have a confusing if getting a brst mobile in cheap price , I have searched many times in the youtubr and the other sources then I git this mobile phone . I get impresses by its face lock features . My Father has redmi note 3 which has fingerprint lock system but the problem is that system do nit work if out hands are wet or any thing is puy on our hand . Facr lock is easy and best method to unlock any device easily . I have the problem with its speed . This mobile has also the great disadvantage of getting hanged many times and also need to improve its speed . Many softwares fo not work with it fully so we have to make yhis sure to choose the right software for this mobile phone . Overall I like this mobile system , its look and many more .####[['face lock', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['softwares', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
After 1 year use : - Memory is less needed some more ( but it ' s quality is good ) Powerful - Camera , LED light , Sound Waste - Screen Light , heating while playing games for more than 40 minutes .

The phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c1 adding 1000 buck don ' t buy it for the user ' s who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people BUT IF YOU ARE GAMER DONT BUY IT REALLY SUCKS ! ! ! go for real me C1 it ' s will give u decent performance in this price range####[['phone', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'positive'], ['phone', 'negative']]
I bought this a gift to my mom who doesn ' t use mobile other than for watching videos . I liked the lowest price point offering but the volume is really low . we end up using headphones . it is so annoying to use that it almost made the phone unusable . I understand that the low cost phone doesn ' t have to offer many features but volume which is very basic feature , this device miserably failed in delivering it . so i recommend for the price point but beware of the volume issue .####[['volume', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
I have purchased this product for my mom as she only used this mobile for calling and still this product get heated up quickly . Camera Quality is not upto the mark . If you are purchasing for streaming videos , whatsapp and other social networking purpose . Recommend not to buy , there are many other phone to buy in this or may be 1000 / - to 1500 / - additional range .####[['Camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
It ' s my bad that even though I read about this phone having issues like hanging etc I went for it just because as price factor as I would be using this as secondary phone . But complete dissatisfaction . Phone hangs even just with one app WhatsApp . Battery even though its 100 % comes down to less than 20 % in 4 - 5 hours ( Yes with out Data , GPS enabled ) . I tried returning this phone and its pathetic that Amazon straightly said they cant return I seriously felt very unhappy with their response on phone , calling agent started giving me gyaan about settings I said I already did more that what she said , so last final answer is I cant return the phone so waste of money . So now 6K under the drain Amazon doesn ' t care once its sold ( its not a offer sale ) . Thanks Amazon you surpassed Flipkart in cheating customers . Kudos !####[['Phone', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Amazon', 'negative']]
Fantastic product in terms of body , looks , battery etc . The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life . Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern ; especially more observed when dual space is enabled . Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads . Go for a Google search of " Phone Has been locked , Try Again in 119 minutes " and verify yourself . Its all about the bug in several of the mi product , and personally faced many times . Imagine you have to call a Uber or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message . Other issue is heating , which is prominent in hot weather . Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer . Otherwise phone is good in this budget .####[['body', 'positive'], ['looks', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['software', 'negative'], ['Mi', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
This product is a very mediocre product . You can ' t even play 60 FPS videos in the youtube app . In short , if you want to do only phone and messaging with this app , you ' ll be fine . For everything else , this phone sucks . Picture quality of camera is decent , not very good . The screen quality sucks . Performance of the phone sucks too . Have 4 or more apps open and the phone will start stuttering heavily . All background apps will have to be force closed to get an optimal performance .####[['phone', 'neutral'], ['Performance', 'negative'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['camera', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'negative']]
The phone is not up to the mark . . As I have seen all the rating and all . . . And i thought I will get a good deal but seriously this phone is waste of money . . . And software problem and app stops in between and many other problems its better is add more money and buy good phone . Storage is very much low after having memory card still i face same issue . . . I advise you to add more money and go for good fon####[['phone', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative'], ['Storage', 'negative']]
Sound Quality is very poor as even on high volume the phone’s ringtone is very audible . The only reason why I bought this phone was due to MI’s reputation of good battery performance which failed to deliver as even after the phone usage is hardly for an hour , it requires charging the next day as well & for the battery to be fully charged , it takes too long . No Value for Money even though it’s being sold for cheap####[['Sound', 'negative'], ['battery performance', 'negative'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative']]
Sound quality is very poor , the phone found to hang within one year . Battery life is not satisfactory . For hanging all the social media apps like whatsapp , facebook etc uninstalled from phone hanging problem reduced but existed . Some times external Wifi was found to not working with the phone after one year to overcome I have to reset the phone many times . Moreover the overall performance is not satisfactory .####[['Sound', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['external Wifi', 'negative']]
I have been using Redmi 4A which I bouhght a year back in the similar kind of sale at same price which is far better in color contrast and other specification . Visual images showing in the promotions interms of sleek design and depth absolutely wrong as its depth looks normal . Especially for the 4A users , it looks quiet low graded model . Increased the length of the mobile but width seems to be not matching up . Font and icon names like Gallery , , etc doesn ' t look that clear to read properly . Totally compared with Redmi 4A , it is a big failure and I won ' t even suggest anyone to spend 6000 rs for this mobile . I took lot of time to consider chinese phone , but they proved once agian that their products are worst . One biggest disadvantage is half of the memory of 16 GB will be used for internal apps of MI .####[['Redmi 4A', 'neutral'], ['Redmi 4A', 'negative'], ['memory', 'negative']]
Worst phone . Hangs a lot . Very slow and sluggish compared to realme c1 and redmi 5a or even redmi 2 prime ! Photo quality also worst front facing camera . Processor is very far behind in real life usage compared to snapdragon 450 in realme c1 . Can ' t play pubg even in low quality as it hangs . Display is also not so large compared to realme c1 . Please by honor or realme c1 or asus zenfone max pro m1 instead of this . They said after I purchased that I cannot return product for phones . So got my money wasted so please don ' t purchase . Display is also poor when watching video at start then recovers slowly . In general not a worthy phone at all by Xiaomi ! It has become money minded .####[['phone', 'negative'], ['front facing camera', 'negative'], ['Processor', 'negative'], ['Display', 'negative'], ['Xiaomi', 'negative']]
Camera is very poor 13mp camera quality shows but when we take pictures quality is 5mp camera like that . When phone is released mi6a 9000rs at the time phone quality is OK . But 5500rs same mi6a phone quality is very poor . When phone rate is high phone quality is a good . And phone rate is low phone quality also poor . My suggestion is when phone comes to market phone price is high please buy that time only . Not a price drop time .####[['Camera', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['mi6a', 'negative']]
It has an absolutely stunning design with BMW Racing Lines . I loved the look of it . In Call of Duty , 8 Gen 2 Processor makes sure there is zero lag and super smooth game I can play . Movies and Videos seem really realistic in this as the brightness of display is so high and best part it even with all this my Battery would easily last more than 1 . 5 Days without Charging . Even when I compared with OnePlus 11 features , the specs of iQOO 11 seemed way better . True Value for Money at this Price Point####[['iQOO 11', 'positive'], ['8 Gen 2 Processor', 'positive'], ['display', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive']]
I sold my iphone 12 for this phone i was bit scare at the first but after playing games for long hours with screen recording does not heat this phone this made me think that i made the right choice at all my iphone was lagging so much but this phone is awesome . SD 8 GEN 2 is beast and runs without any heat for long time . I watched a lot videos about cons of the os skin given with iqoo phone but i am surprised it is clean and have every functional apps preinstalled .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['SD 8 GEN 2', 'positive']]
A very great product launched by Tecno Mobiles Tecno Spark 9 in a very budgeted price with very great and exclusive features in this price segment I’m really very impressed by it’s attractive design and the camera of this smartphone also giving a very impressive pics by providing true colors and also very exciting feature of Ram fusion by using this feature it extends my ram upto 3gb and makes my experience smoother .####[['Tecno Mobiles', 'positive'], ['Tecno Spark 9', 'negative'], ['Tecno Spark 9', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['Ram fusion', 'positive']]
For sure that this device is ' value for money ' . But the specs are not of any use , it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range , but its of no use as graphics , screen refresh rate are not compatible , hence he ram is just kind of waste here . Camera quality is also poor , yes it ' s not upto the mark . You can avail this phone for normal use , but camera needs to be better . As its camera is also not upto mark , this device is not compatible to most people . It ' s a good low budget phone , but instead of RAM , the focus should have been on camera and screen refresh rate .####[['ram', 'positive'], ['screen', 'negative'], ['ram', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'negative'], ['phone', 'positive']]
I bought this mobile on 7th september and it got bad the next day after delivery the problem was automatic restart . Restarting automatically four to five times a day , After a lot of hard work and thrice the Amazon technician came , it got replaced but the problem is still the same , now it restarts only twice . I wanted to give it a star but it has so many features which you will not get in any other mobile and the camera is just below average , I will not recommend this mobile to anyone , so buy it at your own risk . This is the real review .####[['mobile', 'negative'], ['camera', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'positive']]
I am writing this after more than a month of use . . . . battery charging time is worst for this price range smartphones . . . alarm never gets turned on ( it always shows sound was low so alarm didn ' t turned up ) . . , . . . and also it has lacking hardware support . . . . hotspot was getting connected but it was showing device has no internet . . . . although internet was working fine in the device . . . . . . so I have to do factory reset to resolve the issue . . . . . . and yes the most worst part . . . . the phone gets restarted automatically . . . whether u r in a call or surfing or whatever u do . . . . and I am facing this issue right after a week of purchase . . .  So concluding to the issues I am facing . . . . I am very disappointed that I just wasted my money for this shit of piece . . . .  So I would suggest . , . . . . . please go for realme ( not a promotion , it ' s because I am using it . . . way better than techno 9 for this price range ) . . if u wanna use your phone for long . . .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['hardware', 'negative'], ['hotspot', 'negative'], ['techno 9', 'negative']]
Excellent Camera in a mobile phone . . Shutter speed is like a DSLR camera . . All moving subjects has been shooted without any blur . . . Really impressed . . I don ' t see any issues with MIUI 14 . . Intially for the two days . . phone is much warmer than expected but after that it ' s stabilized . SD 8 GEN 2 not optimised like other flagship devices in the market . Xiaomi needs to optimise the software with Hardware . . other than that no complaints . . Awesome camera phone . . I returned S23 ultra and bought this mobile . . still it ' s a beast . . Guys trust me . . You can purchase this mobile without any second thoughts ! ! . . .

Camera is the main highlight of this phone . Practically primary and telephoto camera is very good , ultra wide not so . . SD 8 GEN 2 does its job to run the phone in 2k 120hz mode smoothly without any frame drops in the UI , opening and closing multiple apps , playing games etc . My only complaint will be MIUI though its very refined version still the updates are not that fast ( India Rom ) . Also promised to get 3Yrs of Android + 5Yrs of security updates . In my opinion it should be in line with the Oneplus or Samsung flagships ( 4 + 5 ) . Other than that its a proper flagship experience . Lets see what it holds in the future .####[['Camera', 'positive'], ['primary', 'positive'], ['telephoto camera', 'positive'], ['ultra wide', 'negative'], ['SD 8 GEN 2', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'negative'], ['Android', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive']]
I bought it mainly for the camera and it doesn ' t disappoint there but there are things which not good and which my 5 years old op6 did better , way better infact . The signal catching power is way too low be it wifi or sim ( Airtel and Jio ) . Screen doesn ' t feel as good as my Nexus 3 felt . There ' s lots of small time glitches which I don ' t know if software updates will correct . Bought it for wireless charging but 50w compatible wireless is still not launched in India . Wooosh . . . . The charger is good and camera . . . Oh it ' s very good . I would have given it 4 stars but I was on a OnePlus 6 and it feels like a downgrade most of the times####[['camera', 'positive'], ['signal', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative'], ['wireless charging', 'negative'], ['charger', 'positive']]
I shift to lava Agni 5G from poco X2 because I need privacy poco sending my data to china and I don ' t want it I compared both phones camera poco have good selfie but lava back 64MP kicks off poco . battery life much better on lava it ' s easily give me 10hr battery life on heavy use thanks to stock Android where poco screen on was 5 . 5hr . performance little better on lava . Lava has good display showing pure white colour where poco is warm .

I bought this phone on 22nd may ' 22 . Here I like to share that there is no gallery and regular music apps in this phone . Pics we get from Google photos only . We need to download those apps . And I have given 3 star for picture bcz automatically it ' s taking dim pics though sun light exists and we take it from shadow . For a while brightness occurs but not every time . rest all good . we can excuse these minor things as Google photos also have every feature and can download music app and can go ahead for this phone . Let ' s support Indian branded ones . Jai hind !####[['phone', 'negative'], ['picture', 'negative']]

I bought it for 24 . 5k . I was using Poco F1 from past 5 years and it was great , when compared to this smartphone .  Realme UI3 process is not that great . There is no much features or play around in the settings .  Camera detailing is not great at this price point . Don ' t feel like sony camera is used here . Front camera is worst . 50MP camera is for back n not self and the is just of the phone .  Phone gets heated little .

Battery performance is very poor , very worst battery backup I have ever seen . I am a normal user , even after that it ' s charging twice in a day . But the charging speed is very good .

Back camera performance is good .####[['battery backup', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'negative'], ['Back camera', 'positive']]
If we talk about performance then it is good , no lagging but front camera and wide angle camera is really worst . It should be at least 32 MP front and 50MP wide angle . They have not provided headphone jack . This phone is good for performance and gaming .

I have been using this for 2 days . I liked the camera and display so much . Realme ui is so nice . Charging speed is good . Battery backup is good as well .    I have not faced any heating issue until now and have very smooth experience thanks to snapdragon 888 .    Only con I have seen is the ram management but for average user it is not a problem .    I would say overall balanced phone with customization ui with great camera . I am loving it .####[['Realme ui', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'positive'], ['phone', 'positive'], ['snapdragon 888', 'positive'], ['ram management', 'negative'], ['camera', 'positive']]
Phone is awesome I bought the phone in 27k with this smartphone comes with the Snapdragon 888 which is very powerful and the device is fully optimised  Battery backup is good nearly 8 hours screen on time with normal usage . Camera with OIS is a big advantage in this price range . If your budget is 30 k go for it without any hesitation . The other phone in this price range is iQOO 9 SE but the phone comes with the funtouch OS which makes that phone very bad####[['Phone', 'positive'], ['Snapdragon 888', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'neutral']]
It contains the beast SD 888 which allows you to perform tremendously through long period usage . The Sony IMX766 sensor clarifies the pics and videos to the utmost . This phone also has a feature of recording in 4k 60 fps , thus you won ' t face any troubles while shooting vlogs . The speed of charging is pretty much sufficient , though battery backup could be better .  The best color amongst these three is the paper green which looks even more fascinating with the designer ' s signature .####[['SD 888', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['battery', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Value for money Wala Flagship , I really liked its Camera performance . . . . 50MP primary sensor is killer . . . . Night mode & starry mode also too good . . . .  But only disadvantage in this Flagship killer , that is it ' s battery backup not up to the mark . . but no too much battery drained . . . it ' s batterybackup is 7 - 8 hours Screen on time . . Realme please optimised this issue ASAP . I feel heating issue on it . . . . Basically SDM888 heating issue is normal . . . . but it ' s cooling technology is good !

Changing my review after couple of months , camera and battery is good . But display is hdr10 + but still no update for 4k in Netflix and other ott app , this can be done by update . Also average brightness is very low but it go upto 1300 nits Realme is doing good but in terms of update or quick solutions it ' s very weak Performance is good but not much as we expect from sd 888 . this also can be updated by ui update .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['battery', 'positive'], ['display', 'neutral'], ['display', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative'], ['sd 888', 'neutral']]
Overall the device is Good but the price should be somewhere around 25k but not 30k . Battery backup is 9 hours for average usage which should be atleast 12 hours for average usage . Display is fabulous , camera is above OK , Performance is 4 star .####[['Battery backup', 'negative'], ['Display', 'positive'], ['camera', 'positive'], ['device', 'positive'], ['device', 'negative']]
I think this is one of the best phone in market at this price range . . . . . decent camera , great charging speed , resilient and premium look , flagship processor . I don ' t like glass finish body so this paperback body is super good for me . Realme has come a long way and step up into premium segment .

I Have been using this phone from 15 days . Dint find any issue yet . I seen many comments regarding heating issue specially while charging but I never faced that problems , phone performance is really good and can handle multi - tasking effectively .
