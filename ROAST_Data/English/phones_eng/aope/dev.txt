Battery drains too fast on the running of location services and the battery last around 8 to 9 hours while using location services continuously .

Fantastic mobile in all means . This is the best Android in market without doubt and I feel this is far better than latest iPhone in terms of quality and features .  Noted my observations after 2 weeks of usage .    But think twice before buying this from Flipkart . Such a pathetic service . I bought this phone in exchange of my S20 Fe 5g . My mobile was in flawless condition and the exchange amount was 22k . But during inspection they told it has a scratch on side and 3k will be deducted . It was just a very minor line on the side and because of that they deducted 3000Rs . Absolutely ridiculous .

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE . It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user ' s finger doesn ' t slide smoothly .  The software is very very poor .

Decent purchase within the budget . Camera is satisfactory . Camera quality is the same when compared to Redmi 11T 5G which costs 16k . So comparetively it is a goof purchase in 12k .

What more is do you expect in a mere 12k !####[['Camera', 'satisfactory'], ['Battery', 'good'], ['phone', 'Best for normal usage'], ['phone', 'goof purchase in 12k']]

Phone is descent but the camera software has some issues , even in portrait mode , it doesn ' t beautify the face and overexposes all dark spots , but scenery shooting is descent , battery and performance is excellent , thanks to one ui ,  Totally value for money , probably best phone in this budget and Knox security gives it the upper hand .####[['Phone', 'descent'], ['camera', 'has some issues'], ['software', 'has some issues'], ['camera', "doesn ' t beautify the face"], ['camera', 'overexposes all dark spots'], ['camera', 'scenery shooting is descent'], ['battery', 'excellent'], ['performance', 'excellent'], ['Phone', 'Totally value for money'], ['Phone', 'best phone in this budget'], ['Knox security', 'gives it the upper hand']]
Pastel blue colour looks amazing. A case might kill the look. The colour is nothing you can expect from this price range. Looks far better than 30K phones.    Bought for my cousin. So can’t comment much on internal performances.####[]

The main thing the phone has to do is to connect with the network with out any distraction . Which Samsung a14 5g fails on it . . the network is getting reset offently .

I ' ve been using it for a week now . And it did heat a lot in first 2days of use . But now this doesn ' t happen anymore .  Battery is not upto the mark but I ' m an average user so it lasts a day for me .  Charging speed is the biggest drawback as it supports just 15W fast charging which takes approx 2hrs to charge it from 0 to 100 .  Display is amazing and touch is superfluid just like any other samsung flagship phone .####[['Battery', 'not upto the mark'], ['Battery', 'average user so it lasts a day'], ['Battery', 'Charging speed is the biggest drawback'], ['Battery', 'approx 2hrs to charge it from 0 to 100'], ['Display', 'amazing'], ['Display', 'touch is superfluid']]
Camera is amazing and crisp . Colours are close to accurate . It misses telephoto lens which can be understood because of its design .    Snapdragon 888 is a beast and you won ' t feel any issues with performance and processing .    Build quality is what surprises everyone who holds it . People don ' t expect it to be very strong , but it actually is . Samsung did an amazing task here .    At last it ' s a beautiful piece of engineering . It feels premium and stylish .

All the reviews will tell you all the spec related good things here . . But , I ' ve been using xiaomi phones since 2016 , and I gotta tell you the experience of transferring from MIUI to samsung ' s One UI is just amazing . .

At first hands - on , looks like a pretty solid phone considering the form factor . The obvious tradeoff is the battery life , I ' m getting around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi always on and no sim card . Apart from that the only other issue I feel is that the hinge and folding mechanism is slightly weaker than the Flip 4 as I have used the Flip 4 in Samsung cafe stores and they seem tougher than the Flip 3 .####[['battery life', 'around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi'], ['phone', 'folding mechanism is slightly weaker']]
I got this phone yesterday and have spent most of my time exploring it . Its a superb phone and except for Battery backup I dont think there is any flaw .    You buy cellphones to show off a little , with good specs , smooth operating systen , camera . . it ticks each and every box with flying colors .    Icing on the cake ? The on sale price !

bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues . So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand . It has been a few days since I have been using this phone .

I ' m not a gamer but i can say the gamer won ' t be that disappointed .  One issue i notice is that this phone comes with a few bloat ware which u can uninstall .

after 3 months of usage .  Better wait for Realme 10 pro + which will be at 20 to 25 segment    Apart from display phone is average . . . . . for curved display this is the only phone with value under this range .  Some software bugs are there with banking apps .  Speaker is obsolete rubbish . . . . no Dolby , single mono speaker which is of average quality .  For 1st 10 days as I noticed battery is draining fast .  Sim signals are perfect , as previously used oppo Reno 6 5G I only get 2 or 3 points at home but for this I get complete signal almost every time .  Haptic motar is rubbish , even I never saw this worst haptic feedback in 15K segment , this disappointed me a little when compared to my previous phone .  120 hz i didn ' t feel that fluid when compared to 90 hz in my previous phone .

Over all look and feel it ' s good , if anyone wants to have mobile for normal usage and they can live without curved screen , then I suggest not to go with this .  If you like to use curved display just you can try this .  But apart from curved display this phone is priced very high based on overall performance    And last if you opt for screen damage protection for this phone during service we have to pay an additional 2000 for screen damage .####[['display', 'curved'], ['phone', 'priced very high based on overall performance'], ['look', 'good'], ['feel', 'good']]

Overall wonderful mobile . But it heats up a little during normal operation . Battery backup is very good . Camera is not upto the mark as per price standard .

So I would rate camera 2 / 5 . . . . and other than camera 5 / 5 . Sound was really great .

Overall the phone make and build is poor than vivo X80 ( not X80 pro ) . Performance is as same as X80 . Nothing difference is seen for V2 chip or 9200 chip .

The phone is overall good .  Few things i noted in first 3 days of use :  1 ) battery lasts for an entire day with medium usage .  2 ) speaker output is good and loud .  3 ) still have vivo apps such as - v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled . This should be removed from flagships atleast .  4 ) display is awsome , but LTPO would have been better given the price .  5 ) havent tried heavy gaming , but processor seems capable .  6 ) camera performance is good , but in my old phone i have been using GCAM , so compared to that the stock camera smoothens skin in portrait mode , which i am not a big fan of .  7 ) getting a weird bug , i have JBL Flip 6 , and when its connected , Absolute volume control is not available for some reason .

My first Vivo phone and surely my last one . The display , though AMOLED , comes nowhere near SAMSUNG sAMOLED . The design is prehistoric , especially with the back dated thick bezels . It makes the device cheap looking . Only a colorful back never makes an attractive phone . Battery drains too fast . Charging speed is satisfactory though . The only redeeming feature is the camera quality of the phone . Would suggest not to waste money on it , rather go for some other mobile .####[['display', 'back dated thick bezels'], ['phone', 'design is prehistoric'], ['phone', 'cheap looking'], ['phone', 'colorful back never makes an attractive'], ['Battery', 'Charging speed is satisfactory'], ['Battery', 'drains too fast'], ['phone', 'not to waste money'], ['camera quality', 'redeeming']]

It is a pic of 10pm today . Everything is perfect the only drawback I found that it doesn ' t come with punch hole display . Selfie camera is very good but not up to the mark as expected .

1 . The AMOLED display is much inferior if compared with Redmi and Samsung of the same price bracket .  2 . Front Camera sensor is actually 4 mp and photos come noisy if not taken in sufficient light .  3 . Rear camera photos look dull as colour saturation is low , but the 16 mp sensor is good .  4 . 5G runs amazingly fast in this handset .  5 . Single speaker sound output is also low .  6 . The handset is light and handy .####[['AMOLED display', 'much inferior'], ['Front Camera', 'photos come noisy if not taken in sufficient light'], ['Rear camera', 'photos look dull as colour saturation is low '], ['16 mp sensor', 'good'], ['handset', '5G runs amazingly fast'], ['Single speaker', 'sound output is also low'], ['handset', 'light and handy']]

This is not just a phone but a piece of Art .  Using this phone is an experience in itself , something ' s which elevates the experience are    1 . Wonderfull screen : The highlight of this phone , a curved display is a delight to use in every possible aspect , paired with fast refresh rate which adds to the overall awesome experience .    2 . Very capable processor : Dimensity 7200 does it ' s work and the phone feels pretty slick and quick to everyday usage , yet to see any lags , i don ' t play games so no idea how it fares in that department .    3 . Audio : although v27 has single speaker system , the sound quality is top notch and gives a great audio experience , though it ' s not very loud but the quality is there .    4 .
