I am writing my review after 10 days and i am extremely happy because I choose the best phone in this segment...... 1) The processor is awesome there is no lag and this phone also has various features like it has various sensors to perform various task.... 2)For me the camera is awesome (neither i am a professional photographer nor I like to take photos) but camera faces problem in low light but overall the camera is good.... 3) Last thing I wannna say is that everyone is talking about why there is no amoled screen buy genuinely the display is very good with 144 hz of display..... 4) SORRY I forget one thing the battery and charger I wana say the battery backup is good I gives me approx 10-12 hours of backup the charger is very fast it takes roughly half and hour for my phone to gets completely charged  IF YOU WANT TO BUY A PHONE UNDER 25000 THEN GO FOR REDMI K50I 5G ...........####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Using this phone since one year. Best mobile in so far in redmi Game Bgmi works perfectly 60fps and 90fps Camera is awesome Battry last full day. For gaming 3-4 hour's 5g networks works perfectly in banglore downloading speed was 350 mbps and uploding speed is 150mbps. Network varies city to city.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
I needed a phone with buttery smooth performance with excellent power efficiency and a good battery life and I got it. Camera wasn't my concern as its camera is good enough for my purposes. And it has the best LCD screen I've ever seen. And the sound is also good. With the 8/256 combo, I probably won't be having a need to replace it for the next 5 years. Also, love the phantom blue color. Dimensity 8100 is no joke. I am yet to experience heating outside of gaming. Even during gaming, the phone only gets warm and there's no throttling. The performance remains consistent even after several hours of gaming.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive']]
Bought this almost a month ago , Got it for 15250/- with exchange and cards. And I am absolutely satisfied with this phone. It is undoubtedly most powerful phone in this range. Camera is decent (not the best). Beast performance and 3.5 mm jack available so its best for those who do gaming. Other day to day tasks run smoothly. Some bugs are in OS which can be fixed with updates. Screen is LCD but its good quality LCD with 144 hz refresh rate so it is overall decent although Amoled with 120 hz could have been better. Audio is good with dual stereo speakers present. Fingerprint sensor is quick. Battery backup is good and 67W charging is also fast enough. I am a heavy user and even for me it gives backup for whole day so Battery is overall very good. 4.5/5 phone. If performance matters for You. If camera is more important to you go for Realme 9 pro+ 5g.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
Great Battery, Superb Performance, I mainly bought this phone for performance. No lag in PUBG, APEX LEGENDS, MLBB. As this is my primary phone now i use a lot of battery but still it runs smoothly for a day with a lot of battery to spare. I binge watch Netflix, Prime, Hotstar for 2-3 hours so battery is very good according to me. A lot of people are complaining about the camera but I don't get it, I am not very focused on camera but it gives decent pictures. Back main camera is more than enough for good photography, the front camera is not upto the mark that's true. The feel is not much premium because of the plastic back but you won't feel it. The screen is not AMOLED but I used to have super AMOLED and this screen is doing more than fine for me. I am ok with it. Decent colors and pictures.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'conflict'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive']]
Using it for one month, good budget phone after exchange. Good for playing games and day to day uses, good battery life fast charge is awesome. Bought it for its processor thinking that all phone nowdays have storage expansion by SD card, none of the review had talked about no storage with SD card, so disappointed when I unboxed. Camera is average, back vibration with full volume. Just after setting up it updated to Android 13 with latest security patchs, good for day to dayuses and great for gaming, no heating observed till now. Full charge in 55min. Hoping to get some software updates to tune camera for optimal performance.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['os general', 'positive']]
The K50i is an excellent choice for those in the market for a smartphone under 25,000 rupees. Although its single-core performance is not as strong as the Snapdragon 870 but it compensates with fast multi-core performance. The camera is adequate, but not exceptional. With 12 5G bands, it offers comprehensive coverage of all 5G bands in India. The display is an IPS LCD screen, which is not as efficient with battery usage or color display as an AMOLED screen. The battery performance is satisfactory, but not outstanding. On the positive side, the phone charges quickly, taking just 40 minutes to go from 15% to 85%. The 144Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth user experience.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'conflict'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is good interms of performance and the fast charging.. I am writing this review after using it for 1month..the isuue with phone is sometimes the application doesn't open at all.. And sometimes after opening anything app. Your touch doesn't work and says app isn't working. If these things are fixed by updating software to clear bug whatever then this phone is going to be superphone interms of performance####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative']]
Phone is good in looks has good quality case in box but when phone turned on the struggle starts there on first impression I started using Google Play Store it's big challenge for k50i to run Google Play Store smoothly screen falls black phone will hang it becomes unable to open recent tasks or new tasks it's even kills your recent tasks while only two apps are running one in front and one in background there is lots of tales of bugs in this phone only in the usage of two days and charging speed is good camera is also good display is also good.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
I regret buying this device to be honest. Rear camera is average, front camera is below average (photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better). Battery drains a lot even if you are not using the device, feels like 2-3k mah battery. Ram mangement is pathetic, can't even beat my 4 year old Samsung device with 4 gigs of ram. Device heats a lot when charging or doing normal tasks. The only good thing about this device is the perfomance. This will be my first and last Chinese phone.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Camera: Front camera is very bad both in low light and outdoor. Blurry image and too much blemished. Back camera has struggle with color accuracy. Battery: Average 1day lasting with moderate ussge. But charges fast. Performance: Very good. No hanging or lagging in gaming with high graphics. Display: If you have used AMOLED , this display might make you feel something off. Sound: Very good. Not impressed with the display and camera quality. I was a k20 pro user. Rest are good. If you doesn't focus on camera, go for it.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]
all the things are good, battery performance is very good it can last all day with your all day to day activities and gaming for 2 hour. camera performance is good in day but night photos are little noisy. processor is very well optimized and performance is very good. after 15 days of use i havent noticed major heating issue. slightly heats while gaming but it does not affect your gaming experience. brightness feels little less in day it could be higher. overall its very good budget phone####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
Battery drains very fast. Terrible battery performance not even last a day under average daily usage. I have faced a few lags and mild heating issues also under normal usage. Back Camera quality also not at all good under well lit conditions. After investing this much of amount for this flagship phone from Redmi, I am at a fix now. I don't recommend buying this one.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I changed my phone due to battery problem and i prefer k59i but this phone is not so gud at this price its battery drain so fast. Don't purchase it waste of money. Go for another device if you want to purchase up to;25000. It 5080MAH battery works like a old mobile battery. Camera quality also not good. Pics are like oil painting. Old front camera. Touch is gud. Take more than 1 hour for charging. Don't purchase it if you going to change your mobile. I bought it on 03oct 22 from Amazon. A gud mobile can be purchased in this range from any brand. Chinese brand working like Chinese. Totally a bad choice. Fingerprint works gud. During writing this review battery has drained 2% this is the quality of redmi and it's battery. This is my last mobile from redmi.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive']]
Don't buy this phone if you're looking for gaming. Despite having a powerful processor, it's unable to handle most games. RAM management is very bad, so much that even 2 apps wont stay in ram sometimes. Minor heating issues occur and constant lags while gaming. Games stutter randomly and frequently. Sometimes even crash and a message pops up "System UI not responding"... UI also has a lot of minor bugs which really degrades the user experience. Not at all recommended for heavy users.####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Not a good battery. Since am regular customer in redmi. Am not sure how come this product become worst in terms of battery.just 10days over to this phone and i visited to service center to check on this fault, they said no issue after keeping observation of 1day. But i could see same conditions as before. Now am frustrated on this phone to change this phone, I don't have replacement nor to change battery, Redmi has to understand this situation and request to come to me. Thanks####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Only thing good about this phone is it's battery which provides 6 hours of screen on time. Fingerprint sensor is not good, screen goes white most of time during calls. Dimensity 8100 Processor is overhyped not even close to snapdragon 855. Phone lags most of the time while using. Everything from Speakers & mic to camera & touch are average. MiUi 13 is worst UI. If u are stock Android user then this redmi k50 i is definitely not recommended , lots of ads & bloatware. My 3 years old OnePlus 7 still works way better than redmi k50 i. Such a waste of 27k Rs.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Worst redmi phone I ever get camera quality is poor flashlight blinks before camera takes snaps camera didn't focus on subject and with flash light it takes blurr images. Very very poor for low light photography. Image processing is worst I have never seen a redmi phone with this poor camera performance before... Please don't buy it didn't matter what type of user you are you'll get very very disappointed with camera and it's flashlight...

In half day of using the phone,the phone automatically starting rebooting on loop,it not a software problem more of it is like hardware or motherboard problem,there's no way i can stop restarting ,the phone get very very hot like it can blast anytime,the screen is average LCD,the camera is just like a 10k phone just by giving a good processor it won't make any change,i just want refund.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
One of the worst phone i have ever seen in my life in just 2 months the phone stopped working. Phone got switched off for no reason and unable to switch on and unable to access.it asking me to reboot but after that also not working.. service centre also not responding properly.. not worth for money and not working. Don't buy. Not working at all..####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
The phone is good. Battery life is excellent, in one charge the phone runs for approximately 24hours without any problem. Touch sensation is also amazing. Camera quality is average than other redmi phones of the same price. In daylight good pictures come but during night a bit blurry. Wifi connections is a bit poor and i have faced issues several time with the wifi connectivity of the phone. Sometimes the network itself goes down slowing work process but i expect that this issue will be solved once 5g is launched####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'conflict'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['battery quality', 'positive']]
The phone is awesome (in performance, battery, camera, almost everything). Don't understand why people have given negative reviews above. Has several pre - installed apps, but most of them can be uninstalled, which gives you a clean and clear UI. Network and battery performance is awesome. Camera is also good enough. Obviously you can't get everything perfect in this price range. Overall, great phone. Recommended.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
like my phone very much, great device. Camera is not too good nor too bad, its capture good enough pictures in day light but night photos have some noise in pictures. Its camera only click details picture if click with flash light, otherwise some area are not focused..####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'conflict'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
The battery life is excellent in this phone. 5000mah live up to the expectations. Bought it for my father and he is very happy with this phone. He primarily uses it for Facebook, whatsapp, Video calls, youtube and regular business calls. Had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using the maps to navigate the signal stays strong even in rural areas.

It is a regular phone. You don't expect smartphone experience in this phone. It's camera is not great. Front camera is bad. Ram management and battery performance is poor. Network reception is poor.

Wifi on this mobile is very weak. All other mobiles show good wifi signal however 11 prime shows good but connection speed is 1 to 6 Mbps. I am talking about 2.4 hz bandwith reception. I dont know if its a hardware issue or software, apps wont download & youtube wont play if you aren't sitting next to wifi. I was able to place a replacement order but the replacement handset also had same problem finally called amazon customer care and raised a return request. Its a standard procedure to first raise a replacement request and then a return request of the problem persists. Those who use wifi should not buy this phone otherwise its a fair phone at this price.####[['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Lookwise good. But only lookwise. Sound quality not loud like other phones. Camera is pathetic. Not even class of 13mp. Fingerprint sensor set on start button. Unless you press any key and on the screen if you touch your finger to sensor screen lock will not open. Face lock is better option. Battery is good. As I brought this as my secondary phone only for calling and WhatsApp for my second number not using it harshly to test battery performance.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]

About this product all features and touch sencer and all things are good but battery capacity is low and backup is also not good battery backup is completly poor please if anyone one buy this redmi 11 prime please Don't buy for official use work and camera also not good i want sooner to be change this phone ..####[['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
Camera Quality is not good. I took pics of function but it takes the pic as dark faces. Its camera quality is very bad even below Rs.8000 phones have good quality than this mobile. Don't buy it. Due to my accident I was not well and not able to see my phone properly upto 10 days of delivery. When one function came then I realised and felt insulted after taking pics. So time passes away otherwise I would return within the return time.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Overall Phone performance is good, but there are many MI apps which you can't uninstall and those all default apps that used your mobile data quickly. The camera is mentioned 50 megapixels but it captures the photos in daylight very bad and not so clear, and night vision is even worst. seems like 5-megapixel camera. MIUI is worst even that not allow us to hide apps in the drawer or not allow us to make folder groups of apps. Don't buy it if you are buying it for camera purposes.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]

I use this phone from 1 month. I don't recommend this phone to buy anyone. It's camera not good, battery life not good, wi fi signal very low, wi fi connect only when signal above 3 to 4 level. 0 to 2 level it's wifi not connect but same time other phone wi fi connect. Data network very bad. It's stopped any time in video streaming but same time other phone on same network streaming video. It's software not optimised, if you use your phone you know that there are more bugs in software included. Call recording not available because it's use google dialer. Phone lags everywhere because miui consume it's full ram. Ram expansion feature not working, It's only marketing. Phone camera lags when click pictures. With flash light it's camera take more time to capture photo, very irritating. Without any app open it's cleaner show to clean cache files about 2 gb, don't know where it's generate cache in background. System loading always, waiting for app list show, very bad software.

The quality of the power button is very poor. I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023. When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device (As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped, hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost. I told them that there was no crack on screen or dent on any other part of the phone and asked them to write in writing that they confirm that the phone was dropped. However the service centre refused warranty claim citing company policies.####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone warranty', 'negative']]

The camera quality is not more than 10-12mb other compared camera. The customer service is pathetic.

Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal. Its buttery smooth, no lag what soever, camera is top notch like its top quality. I thought it would take time to get adjust to its OS but for me it was no problem. I thought I would miss many feature from android but tbh most of the androids features are gimmicky and I only ever miss multitasking from android. But then again I am going to a very budget phone so i dont really know the true extent of android flagship phone but then again if you are going to pay premium price for a phone why not a Iphone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'negative']]
As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'conflict'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera(highly impressive video quality), battery life(normal use-more than 10hrs,Gaming-4-5hrs), performance(best). But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge(good factor-it takes 30mins for 50percent charge). Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming.writing this after 6months usage.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'conflict']]
I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately. This phone is perfect for all, whatever you need you can get from this device. Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb. Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7-8hrs of backup. Build quality is superb. The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate, Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it, rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate. And guys i love the notch so sorry about it i can't comment on this.

It is an amazing phone, the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones, it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6-7 hours screen time which is decent (depending upon how you wanna use your phone, i use mine primarily for work, emailing, googling, watching videos and all). The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow, this is my switch from android to ios for the first time, although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great, total value for money (got it for 62k)####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'conflict'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos, just go for it. A15 bionic is super fast and it has amazing performance it is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user, but if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed. Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only .####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its apple (we shell not talk about worth of money) Edited review After using it 2 months -: battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90% and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30% after 4 hours so battery is good enough….

Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement. Android users may find the security annoying..I did....biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book. Audio(Stereo )quality is awesome for a phone. Battery will last 1 day for average users .....jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks (on Android) is a bummer....but security is security .No 4k for cinematic ....####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
A good phone for which you might need to sell your kidney. Battery life is decent, user interface is same as of Android, camera quality is decent but if I am going to spend 70k on a phone for camera, I better spend it on a DSLR.

I paid 73,000 for a phone but they don't give a charger! Thats so cheap about apple. Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste. Good decision. If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger, then why they need to produce new phones in the first place? To cut down waste and save environment, they can stop producing phone as well, right? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention. My 2 stars is not for the phone, but for their cheap tactics to cheat people.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Applications crash very frequently. The phone heats up specially outdoors. Call conference has stopped working. Touch is not proper, many time touch screen doesn’t acknowledge my touch.

"I never thought that I would receive such a bad iPhone from Amazon when I ordered it online. My iPhone is taking extremely blurry photos and it heats up quickly, within 10 minutes of using Instagram or snap. when I called customer service for a replacement,they refused to exchange it directly. This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it. I thought the camera would be great, but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating. I bought it for Rs. 60,499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13." My only request is that you replace my iPhone 13 as soon as possible...####[['platform general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
I bought this phone keeping in mind that apple phone has very powerful processor,but it looks like at this price I could have bought a better android phone.This iPhone 13 has very serious heating issues. Only after 15 minutes of gaming or video recording,the phone starts heating up to the point where it gets very uncomfortable to hold it. So please think before buying this phone.Total waste of money. Not worth the hype.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Thought that at least I phone won’t hang but it’s been only 1 month I bought it and it started hanging already and it’s been 3rd time in a month. Wasn’t able to access any app not even able to move between the screens. Ultimately I had to shut down my phone and restart it again. Then what difference iPhone made when compared to an android phone. Really pathetic, annoying and disgusting to experience this kind of things from an IPhone. Sheer waste of money and obviously not value for money.

Good quality..The camera is also really good but could be improved..The body of the mobile feels good and lightweight..The display is great and sharp with good refresh rate.

These days phones are so much the same. The development of phones has reached a point of saturation and the kind of processor speeds these companies are providing we rarely use unless u r a gamer who require hard core specification. A good phone like other oppo devices and the led around camera looks cool. Overall a nice design gifted it to my wife she liked it. More of a phone for casual use.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I excitedly bought this phone along with a new Jio sim to finally harness 5G. I checked the factors of price, specifications, and so on to decide on a new phone, and this one was the clincher. It is overall a fine smartphone. My friends had lots of good things to say about it. I personally love its battery life.  I had a little bad experience with gaming with it though... I was playing Efootball 23 and the operations in-match weren't working at all. It was frustrating.

Not met the expectations of what Motorola promised. Performance is something I was looking for and this phone just did not meet the expectations. Hangs up a lot while multitasking.

Good looking phone. Fast with 5000 MAH battery. Camera is also good. Just one issue that I'd doesn't charge as fast as it says. With 65 watt charger it takes around an hour to charge.

Haven't got any complaints overall, good built quality, display is vibrant enough and bright, battery life is on the better side, lasts a while. It can feel a bit slow and take some time to load apps up but that's to be expected with a 2 GB RAM The camera could've been better, it takes great vibrant photos but bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details.

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media. This is a very good option for you. I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose. This has only 2 gb of ram so don't think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won't run very smooth under above normal conditions. There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash. But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life. There is no fast charging only normal charger is given. So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media.####[['memory design_features', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Bought it for ₹6799. Still working proper after 2 years. Battery life on normal usage is about 1-1½ days, if used only for making calls then about 5-6 days.

I bought this phone for my mom. She's been using this phone since an year. I always buy redmi because they've gained my trust. My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime. They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust, but shockingly, the phone was utter disappointment. My mom is a very light user. She only uses phone for calling and youtube. But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks. It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera. I resetted the phone, updated software, everything but of no use.

Overall, it is a great bargain at 25k.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Everything seems to be working fine. The camera is okayish. No heating issue, the temperature during charging stays below 40c. 5g is working as expected in my area which is quite a bit away from main city,the max speed i got is 550mbps, for some reason charging animation does not work but that's not an issue for me. Great performance. The display is above average from my pov.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
MORE BETTER EXPERIENCE THAN EXPECTED, NO WORDS THE BEST PHONE IN THE SEGMENT. IT COSTED ME AROUND 23,0000 AND IT'S THE FLAGSHIP UNDER 25K. NO WORDS JUST GO FOR IT, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED....####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Everything about this phone is really good. Processor, camera, software, battery life, updates. Only little grope I have is battery life. It's great but not excellent like z6 series.

Its been one year still i got this phone ,I like this phone ,but battery is average.apart from that there is nothing to say bad about this phone ,i wont recommend this phone as now bcz we have good new launched phone lot better than this####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]
While clicking photos and recording videos the handset is getting slightly hot. Picture quality is awesome. Previously I was using Vivo Z1X, in that handset this problem was not there. I'm using the phone just 2 days.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
Reviewing almost after 4 months... Everything was nice...

It is a fine/ok/good product, i bought the phone mostly for Ram and strorage. Nice camera, Could have been better but it is fine. Phone Works smooth though i don't use for gaming and all. it takes 16to 18 min to charge 50%.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I've bought this in sept 2022 and have been using it since then. In starting it was good but after updates, it is full of bugs and glitches. The main flaw is, while typing if any notification comes then keyboard will automatically shuts. Camera is not very great. Just okayish####[['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
Batter backup could be better eventho charging is super fast. 25 mins to 100%. Missing many normal functionalities. Also, no patter or fingerprint needed to power off/shut down the phone, so if u loose the sight of ur phone and it falls into someone's hand even for 5sec, it's GONE.####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
I loved the picture quality of this phone. Also fast charging mode is tooo much good in just 20-25 mins it gets fully charged also a battery life is also good...but one thing that not works properly in this phone is finger print sensor.. it take little bit time to scan ur finger... Iqoo neo 6 need to improve it . also the Mobile is low weighted easy to carry.. according to mobile features and quality price is too High..####[['display quality', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
There is glitch in this phones software . And i my handset i am facing issue- when I am watching any video and a msg drops the volume becomes which is fine but it should come again on same level .

it is not worth for money. The operating system sucks for this mobile, whenever I try add a new widget it selects some auto widgets not the one i selected, if i try to add a new application icon to the home page it does not add it, the phone is behaving weirdly. This is my first buy of mobile online, i regret my decision####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
If you are thinking for gaming .Don't buy any iqoo series mobile .they are not meant for gaming they are just good for 7 days more or less afterward they show there truecolour .####[['company general', 'negative']]
Battery is a major set back, though it charges superfast but gets discharged also very superfast, even though there r no apps running in the background, i don't play games like free fire etc.,though it is a gaming phone still battery doesn't last even for 24 hrs.

Everything beyond this bug is fine. Everything is running fine.####[['phone general', 'conflict'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Power and performance wise the device is a beast. However, I noticed very late that phone has light bleeding issue. In dark environment, the bleeding is clearly visible on black wallpaper. To clear the doubt if the black image I used had some shades, I used rgb app and confirmed that it has bleeding issue. Unfortunately, the replace window is closed and I am stuck with this.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'negative']]

Writing this review after 6 months of purchase. I dropped in water for less than a second. It turned off after that. Now it's repair cost is more than it's original cost- not covered by warranty. I have had other brands phones which got wet more than once but never got any problem. This was my worst experience. My 28k down to zero just in one second.####[['phone warranty', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
It was working fine till 6 months, since I did not update it when I update it lot more issue starting to show, it's being white background anytime for few seconds and battery drainage too quickly. I am regreting to purchase this phone####[['software general', 'negative']]
Everything was good in box of mobile and it's accesories and more and most attractive thing was mobile design but you should work on camera bcoz camera experience is good but not that must but you are providing a smartphone with low price and really like this.

A very great product launched by Tecno Mobiles Tecno Spark 9 in a very budgeted price with very great and exclusive features in this price segment I’m really very impressed by it’s attractive design and the camera of this smartphone also giving a very impressive pics by providing true colors and also very exciting feature of Ram fusion by using this feature it extends my ram upto 3gb and makes my experience smoother.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]

The Phone Is Pretty Good, RAM Can Be Expanded Really Easily, Runs Very Smooth You Even Have An Option To Change Your Refresh Rate Camera Is Good Aswell But It Charges Really Slow So If You Put It On Charge Let It Charge For Atleast 1h 30 mins - 2h the battery last long pretty good aswell overall a good phone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['memory design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
For sure that this device is 'value for money'. But the specs are not of any use, it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range, but its of no use as graphics, screen refresh rate are not compatible, hence he ram is just kind of waste here. Camera quality is also poor, yes it's not upto the mark. You can avail this phone for normal use, but camera needs to be better. As its camera is also not upto mark, this device is not compatible to most people. It's a good low budget phone, but instead of RAM, the focus should have been on camera and screen refresh rate.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['memory design_features', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative']]
It's 4gb ram was working like 2gb ram, after expend it was working nice. Camera filters are so good. Night mode is not so pretty cool but, that's prize range camera is awesome. Face lock is also good. Don't buy for pro gaming and professional use.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative']]
I like for it's camera quality,but it shuts down every few hours,which is irritating,at times I am in the middle of something important,like on a call, and it shuts down.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
A lot of bloatware. I cleared and disabled everything except some system apps. I think it's only suitable for video calling purposes. Bought it for my parents. And it's enough.

Working very slow ,charger is not good ,specially when we restart the phone it will lots of time to take a restart .installing apps are also very slow working over all don't go for this phone ,only for 6/128 my suggestion is to take a redmi phone or oppo that's phones really good at this price also .waste of money I want return this phone as soon as possible.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
the phone was in good condition. But had a dent on the transparent screen shield. Had to remove it. phone has become slower. it was having ok speed when I started using it.

This phone is the most unstable one I have ever seen. The 5000 mAh battery drains too fast, the OS is quite fragile, device keeps on rebooting abruptly even after you have installed all the available updates. IT is most embarassing when the phone reboots during an ongoing phone call or as soon as you start dialing a contact. Also touchscreen does not perform well.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
As soon as you start the phone it starts to hang. The HiOS sometimes stops working. The RAM is almost consumed upto 60% when you start the phone for the first time. The refresh rate is hopeless. Extendable RAM is just a hoax, doesn't make any difference. Also when you open the package, you’ll be shocked to see that phone screen is not safely wrapped, so the screen might come with a few minor scratches####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['shipping quality', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for my elderly father. The overall view of the phone is excellent and that's it. After, 1.5 months the phone started to restart on its own and I went to the service center. They fixed it and when I reached home, the phone completely shut down. Its been a week now, am still waiting for the phone.

I recently bought 14 days ago Techno Spark. I bought it for my staff. He told me Sir the phone charging is to slow. I told him show me the phone.

There are lots of negative reviews but this phone is overall a good phone. Yes front camera is not very good in low light, this is not for those who takes lots of selfies and use phone mostly for camera, but in daylight front camera is taking good photo. Battery might take some time for first charge as in all new phones first charge take time as it calibrate. I have used it for 3 days and after first and 2nd charge, fast charging is working properly. Battery life is also very good.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'conflict'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
One of the worst experience I've ever had on a smart phone. I'd give a 5 star for the battery but rest all just 1 star. I am aware it's only 4gb ram but I feel like multi tasking in this feels like 2gb. It's a quad camera but the lens is damn worse. I get so much hanging issues in just 2 months. I'll give 1 star for os as well ui is good but the glitches are bad. My apps are closed automatically many times.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['os usability', 'conflict']]
I got this for 9k and for this price I think this is the most balanced phone. Only weak point is that this is not very fast I don't like the Helio processor used here, it would have been a perfect phone if there was Snapdragon 680. But overall it's good. Battery life is awesome. 90Hz is OK not ultra fluid but far better than 60Hz.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive']]

Out of the box phone looks good, case provided +1. Screen looks decent. One factor making the experience bad is the time taken to charge the device. Exceptionally slow.

BEST TO STAY AWAY.Camera okay. Battery somewhat okay. That's it. Nothing else okay. In the description this is dual SIM phone. This is hybrid sim phone.

The phone has crispy display, nice battery life, average camera but it's not fast as you would expect a 6GB phone to be.

The phone is good for average user and will not give any issue for about 2 years, 90 Hz ambled display, massive battery, decent camera, processor could have been better.

I'm using cellphones from the past 13 years, but this M32-6GB battery backup was the most worst so far. I used 6000mah phone in before. But it's battery backup was 4 times better When compared with M32. Camera quality was also average. So i replaced it within 10 days i got same m32 -6 Gb in 20 days.

I'm writing this review after 3 months of usage. Finger print sensor is the biggest problem with this phone. It fails 8 times out of 10 attempts. So much lag with almost all apps. Camera quality is average but the shutter speed is very bad. Even for normal use, it does not perform upto the mark. Signal reception is below average. Display is the only good thing in this phone, but due to poor performance of the processor we don't get to enjoy the goodness of the screen.

I tried to get repair in Samsung service center they changed my jack after doing it said issue not resolved with new jack issue in motherboard it cost 7k. Worst experience with samsung after sale service is highly expensive. Don't but this phone try another company.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['company price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
After almost an year of using it, I am very frustrated by samsung forcing there unwanted apps many times after a forced update these guys have notification you cannot dismiss about opening a samsung account.

The iPhone 12 has been an amazing phone for me. It's great for streaming, messaging, and browsing the internet. Its processing speed is incredibly fast, and the design is sleek and modern. The battery life is also excellent and can easily last a full day of moderate use. The camera is fantastic, and the photos I take look stunning. The display is vivid and bright, making everything look great. Overall, the iPhone 12 has been a great purchase and I'm very pleased with it.

its amazing so far, if you’re looking for great battery backup- playing games whole day, it’s not worth it.. battery drains fast but if you’re a user who just wants to get through the day and use it for work only… battery would be okay at the end of day.####[['phone general', 'conflict'], ['battery general', 'conflict']]
Me being an android user switched to IOS coz get iPhone experience … with just 48k iPhone 12 64 gb must phone to buy because it’s performance is super awesome,camera is good,battery backup should’ve increase to 4000 mah at least but I’m supprised with just 2815 mah it lasts 1 day to few more hours,it’s quick responsiveness is pretty good…Overall awesome phone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
I have only one dislike, if the phone is off and the phone rings there no option to decline the call. As you know I am a new iPhone user. I have brought an iPhone for the very first time. So, it will take time for me to get used for it. But the camera quality and battery life has shown a sudden improvement. Thank you apple.####[['software general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Whereas brand is apple, you can expect standard handset which it should be. Camera is good, display is good, sound is good, battery is average indeed.

I'm using Iphone from last 10 years and quite satisfied. this product is also good ihone 12 have quite new features.

i purchased this mobile in 2022. If you are looking for gaming i phone then go for pro version of i phone 13 and 14 because there are frame drops issue and battery drain is fast like my poco f1 but still you can play bgmi nicely under fast network speed and low room temperature .

It is not bad as it should for the amount you shell out to buy it. I am having a little issue though, the lightning cable that came with the phone has stopped working in less than 2 months. So that makes you question if the product is really worth it. does the make and quality justify the price?####[['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]

Sometime freezes, keyboard doesn’t pop up, and not attaching files in mails while after so many tries. When I close the app then open it again then it attaches the files and same with keyboard.

If you're someone who is a heavy user then it sucks. Even for a new device you have to charge it twice a day. Camera is pretty good. Considering the current pandemic and face mask situation.

Apple is loosing its grip as a premium product. Now it slows down, hangs often, reboots and irritate. It’s slowly becoming just a symbol rather than an actual smart phone.####[['company general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Problem arrived on the next day after the return window closed, Touch not responding while on a call not even to cut or hold the on going call, after 5 to 10 times pressing the side button then only its responding, given to apple service they sending it back to apple india in Bangalore, near about it takes 5 to 7 working days, feeling frustrated####[['hardware general', 'negative']]

Did not expect this from Apple. Charging premium price which is very very unreasonable. Killing middle class by looting customers. Not worth the premium price they are charging. Phone is heating too much during charging, I have to keep it in Fridge for 10 minutes to cool it down. Also internet speed is not constant. It keeps dropping. With the same sim and same recharge plan, in Samsung mobile, internet speed is constant and working good.####[['company general', 'negative'], ['company price', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Product is extremely poor quality. Better to buy samsung. Much competitive and much better dispay and product quality. I do not belive now onward in iphone quality. Within a 20 days of purchase mobile displays is stop working. Display is not damaged at all and even mobile is not fall single time. Mobiles are not well tested for quality.####[['phone quality', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative']]
Too much price for the features. Camera is not good, especially potrait pictures are soo blur & low resolution in room light. Other brands offer much better cameras & zoom at this heavy price.

After using adroid phone the I phone is more slower than any Android phone. Picture quality not as expected. Some of the apps not working as in Android.

I was searching for a decent smartphone for very nominal usage and was not interested in going for high budget range and then I saw this phone. This has really good build quality and the touch finish also gives good on hand feel. I was amazed by the battery backup, it really goes for two days literally. Camera quality has got some compromise but can't expect more at this price range. Screen quality is also great.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'positive']]
This phone is decent enough as per its price point, it can be the best mean device for normal usage and for those who don't have anything much to do with high fi features. A simple device, and easy-to-go device.  Just the con is the huge battery size it has, it does not have a fast charging option hence it takes a little longer to fully charge. However, as I said if a user is a very simple user who has nothing to do much with haste can take good time to get charged. Since my mom is a homemaker as per her insights it is a decent choice.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Good mobile for the price. Display, sound, processor speed are good. No lag noticed. The sensor for Google fit seems to be around 25% less sensitive as compared to samsung m31 or wearable apps.

I am writing this review after seven days of using this phone. This phone is budget friendly and coming within 9k. Sensitivity , screen quality , operating are easy. This phone takes minimum 2 to 3 hours for full charge. Cameras are not upto the mark. Useful for general use. Giving 4 out of 5.

For under 10k a great Samsung phone. Great battery life & easy to use. Great UI & loved the in hand feel & yeah it looks beautiful. The charging speed could have been if they included a 15w charger and no fingerprint reader is a miss.

It is a below average mobile. I feel Samsung should have provided fingerprint sensor. Also, charging speed is super slow. It takes upto 6 hours to 100% charging. Screen is below average.

Note: My suggestion please chose another phone####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
The phone itself is good at this price bracket, but the front camera is the worst camera I have ever seen in an Android phone. It would be better for Samsung as an established brand to update it's 5 MP front camera which works as 0.3 MP VGA Camera. Rest is ok in this phone as promised and mentioned. The success of this phone could be ruined by only it's Front camera. Now a days everyone uses front camera for Video Calling via WhatsApp, Facebook or direct from Operator, and my personal experience is extremely bad for this particular phone.####[['phone general', 'conflict'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]

I've been using this phone since last one month. So far I've seen no issues with it. Everything works perfect fine and the phone runs smoothly.

Bought it before a month. Now i am using it as a paper weight. No splash proof, for light drizzling in rain the mbl got damaged and the service centre asking 5500/ for entire display change.

The phone in itself is very well designed with a proper 3-slot sim card tray and 4 cameras but the 2 mp macro lens does not produce good photos. The battery life is good and the screen is also quite good. Brightness is adequate and the charging for the phone is also fast. The phone can run cod at ultra but now the limit has been reduced.

Battery drains very fast even Im not a rough user. Camera quality feels much better. Maybe because my previous phone had less camera specs than this one.

I don't know how the makers manage to get so many good reviews, rather it should be mixed. The phone I purchased, it's only 15 days and the problem of ghost touch is occuring. Suddenly so many things get active, some randon clicks into settings or app happen without even any touch from my side. I removed all the cover and screen guard(both company provided) still the issue persists. Not even reboot button responds when this issue starts.

The charger doesn't work pretty well and only works fast charging less than half of the time. The UI is pretty lagging. The camera quality is below par.

We bought the phone in December 2019. It worked well for a while. It was used sparingly. But since September 2021, the phone went into reboot loops. At first it started whenever we'd click a photo.

In less than 2 yrs of usage, battery became dead. It takes just 3-4 hrs to completely discharge the battery from 100% to 0%, even without using a mobile.

Battery also discharges very fast. Overall not at all happy with the phone.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative']]
Mujhe is price point pe kuch disappoint nahi hua iss price me camera is Normal I can actually satisfied. Performance is very good and battery is really shoked me battery is superb I'm impressed from battery but there is not a plus point that there is a normal 18W charger thats why charging is not so fast. All over I'm totally satisfied####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
You have to buy this product in this price range, I reviewing after 6 month camera quality is too good in this price range as well as battery aslo, If you are normal user then it will survive al least 2 days easily. But problem is that this mobile little bit thick. And everything is all right, The is different it doesn't give you 'feku' look, It looks like premium. If you purchasing mobile in this price range then I recommend this one.......####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'conflict'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Everything just works well except the front camera which is average otherwise everything is good and battery life is the highlighted point of this device I am using from 3-4 months and gives me easily two days battery life.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
This phone is quite good if you purchase it during diwali sale time in November. It's good for normal use. You can gift this simple phone to your elder one's. Like your dad's dadi and other old loved ones####[['phone general', 'positive']]
It is a perfect choice for budget friendly phone. If you spend ₹8500 (4gb,64) for this phone then it will be a totally worthy. If you get this phone above mentioned price then go for it don't hesitate. Finally according to my personal use it works perfectly but i noticed a minor bugs after android 12 update, don't worry it may be correct in the next update. Overall its a worthy buy####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Not happy with the camera so far I used in a month may be after using more my feedback can change on this. Phone body is made with light weight plastic which makes it very light weight but after taking phone on hand does not feel the luxury of good phone. Face lock is awesome. Charger adapter is very heavy weight and big as compare to other phones.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'conflict'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative']]
Very good product at best price range, selfi camera is not so good compare to rare camera, display is good and satisfactory but battery is the heart of this product and the storage is the body which makes this device amazing, 4gb RAM is good not too bad for daily users and product doesn't disappoint you in this price range 11K.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['memory design_features', 'positive']]
The battery is the best part of this phone. The camera has average quality which is enough for normal use in day to day life. Performance is good according to the range. Fingerprint reader and faceunlock works very well.

Camera is not good, battery is good, i can fill while using this phone that quality is not good as expected, brightness is the big issue it is not good, narzo needs to work on it. I will sell this phone after 6-8months use.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative']]
Only problem is that it's RAM management is very poor and no one discussed about it . I was totally unaware of this fact. Like when You open a game and then open something else and then open that game again then it will start from starting and this is sometimes frustrating.####[['memory general', 'negative']]
I recommend this phone to people whose primary focus is not camera or speakers.. both of these are terrible on this phone, but always it's a trade-off at his price range. Rather, what you get is a above-average chipset, a decent display and a mammoth battery to get you through atleast 36-48 hours in one go. If you want a secondary phone for yourself, this should be your obvious choice.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
i am writing this review after using it for 8 months. I biggest problem I am facing with this is the poor battery backup, i baught this phone, because of good battery backup but it sucks as the days passes. The quality is decreasing. Raised the complainant but did not get any aid. Rest is ok with phone.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery quality', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'neutral']]
Starting 3 months, it was good, but after I got the battery issue, the charging timing was nearer than 5 hrs. if I charged the mobile, max I will use the 8 hours. A nearby service center is also not available. Hereafter I will not buy any Realme-related products and I'm not suggesting any Realme products.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
The phone's back panel quality concerns me the most ,it's the worst in any of the phones,also the battery drains too quickly and not even last for a whole day on minimal usage. The device also heats up severely while charging,and that's also a major concern. Not recommended to buy at all.####[['phone quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Narzo 50a disappointed me in term of its camera quality.. it even can't scan whatsapp QR code on computer... it does not look like 50 megapixel camera... its battery is superb as it has hd+ display its battery last for 2 days in moderate use.. in this price range you will get good camera phones.. try other options if you want a camera phone..####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
The phone is getting slow and fingerprint doesn't even work sometimes. Clicking pics takes more time,even to view pic takes more and more time to open gallery.

Phone is slow, nothing is likeable into this phone. worst phone ever used. Even my previous mobile infinix HOT 8 was working better than this after two years of heavy usage. Realme is fooling people around. only plus is build quality is better than low budget smartphone.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Camera quality is very low, does not feel like 50MP at all. Picture quality feels like 2MP photo. Other brands have excellent picture quality even for 13MP camera for the same price range. Not worthy at all. Don't waste your money. We can't return it after purchasing if we don't like it! Only replacement NO refund.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
I a, very disappointed with this phone very bad WhatsApp video calling everything is blur camera is ok but the mobile is not good I have to press the hard unlock side button. waste money plus the voice quality is also very bad its like a humming noisy voice.

Camera quality is also good. Overall I am happy with the phone.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I have been using this phone for more than a week now and I can say this is value for money in this price range. If you watch videos on YouTube and try to buy a phone it will be difficult to decide. I compared the specifications online and decided to buy this and I am happy.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
What a good looking device it is. In hand feel very impressive you amazed by build quality. 48 mp camera take stunning picture. Snapdragon processor is too good in processing. Super smiled display is too good when you injoy media content. 5000 mah battery is enough for one day with heavy uses.

Is a great mid-range phone that offers solid performance and excellent camera quality. It has a display and a dual-lens camera that takes excellent photos in any lighting condition. It's also equipped with 5G connectivity and a long-lasting battery that can easily last all day. The only downside is that it lacks some of the high-end features found in more expensive phones.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative']]
Im curious about this phone before launch as redmi note 11 series were not that great but once 12 series were announced i was curious to know about this mobile and booked away on its 1st sale upto today this mobile performance has impressed me a lot,and camera was too good to say,and ads were reduced but it should be improved more####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Overall nice phone. Display is very good. Battery is good. Survive 1 day as per my useage. Some time finger print reader lack. Camera quality not so good. Day light image quality up to the mark but when use at night or low light conditions image quality not up to the mark at this price point.

I'm using this mobile for the past twenty days, I literally found this mobile with slow like a snail. There is some heating issue. Obviously large display size but the battery couldn't perform with its 5000 mAh capacity. The charge drains like a waterfalls. The autobrightness feature is not working. The mobile gets struck during some important event.

Overheating is major issue. If you just watch a video in phone. It'll get heated up. Camera is dull. Not upto mark as expected from 20k phone. Lots of bloatware. I'm not satisfied with the performance of 20 k phone. Other things are nice but one problem is major issue. Overheating I'm just get scared bcoz it'll blast at anytime as expected from redmi phone.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
It's less than a month and whenever a call comes, and the phone rings right whenever a call comes, but the caller's name/call acceptance button turns on after a significant amount of time. Other than that, it's a value for money.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
The product is good in its look, but it's software not as per expectation. Touch screen, finger print sensor is not smoothly works. Heavy in weight. The processor works slow down.

The extended RAM doesn't makes any difference and the phone hangs wherever I get a call. Some of the apps even after installation are not visible in the Apps list. User interface is not good enough.

Review after 20 days of usage. I am a xioami user but this phone has disappointed me a lot. Very bad camera and photo quality like VGA phone.

The phone quality is only good from outside and inside phone quality is very poor. Worst camera very very poor quality.

I haven't face any lag in day to day task and it performed very smoothly even while I played BGMI experience was quite good.

Used this phone almost 40days n giving this review. It's simply superb with awesome camera and very good battery backup n fast charging.

Have been using this phone for the past 4 weeks. So far, the performance has been impressive in this price range. Battery backup is extremely good. Only shortcoming to this phone is that camera isn't that great. My one plus Nord (previous phone) use to capture better pictures than this one. Don't expect much from camera. Face lock also works when it wants to. Doesn't work all the time.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]

Very good mobile at this range, premium look. I purchased as pre-order got earbuds for free. Battery life is above average but charger with 100w super charge it will cover.

Phone is good in terms of camera and day to day performance. But the network receiption has some issues. The network in phone disappears randomly sometimes even though in other phone the network strength is excellent and after couple of restart and network reset n sometimes reinserting sim, the signal comes back. Frequently happen when I use 5G. Not sure whether I got a defective piece or general problem in OnePlus 11R.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for having good snapdragon processor but it didn't met my expectations. People spends money on costly phone just for getting good performance and better camera, but don't expect much from this phone. Phone have network issue even after 5g,you get 4g network. Only battery performance is good in this phone rest don't expect much. I am missing my realme x7 max phone it was really very good phone than oneplus 11r.####[['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
The battery life is disappointing. Even with moderate usage, the battery drains quickly and needs to be charged frequently. This can be a major inconvenience for anyone who relies on their phone for work or personal use. The build quality is not as good as previous models. The phone feels flimsy and fragile, and the back cover scratches easily. The fingerprint sensor is also unreliable and often fails to recognize my fingerprint. The price of the ONEPLUS 11R is not justified considering the subpar features and performance. There are many other smartphones in the market with similar or better features that are available at a lower price point.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]

I was happy with the phone when I bought it, but the moment I saw the green lines on my screen after 15days of use I was very disappointed.

I have taken on last month phone usage was not satisfactory and display was too much delicate my elbow touched and it was broken I have never seen such delicate phone so I am not at all satisfied with the phone.

1 week later i recievdled the phone it fell from the bed. and the screen shattered. the screen alone is 28k. i called customer care and told how delicate the device is. he said sir the device should not fell in an angle it should fell on screen then it won't break. but god help them to understand accidents happens without telling you if the phone is dropping in angle or straight. i also requested oneplus to mention on thier website that you should not drop phone in an angle, drop it straight. in the end after 17 days of use i sold that device in 20k.####[['phone design_features', 'negative']]
Worst phone quality ever. Phone was flickering earlier. And then suddenly whole phone is now green screen. Cannot do anything.

I am very happy and satisfied with this product. The touch and feel of the phone is nice and also the display is amazing. Some of the positive features of this phone is 1. battery charger and batter backup. Exactly in 30 mins your phone is fully charged for the 80 w charger 2. The 12 GB RAM power is amazing. It works seamlessly for all the application 3. The camera is good if not best, since I am not much excited with the camera so this world quite well for me. 4. The extra power booster to play games is also good 5. Some of the added features like gesture control and secret vault to store files will excite lots of people 6.

Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones.

Bought it solely because I needed a phone that charges fast and oh boy this phones charges in a flash. The best part they give you the charger. I did not face any heating issue in normal operations and light gaming(30mins) of Vangaurd. The phone does not discharge fast of you fast charge that's just what it seems like, i do recommend turning off "rapid charge".  The camera isn't bad.  I wanted the phone for fast charge and I cannot defective how useful that was to me on my trip, i was done charging in 15 while other were waiting.####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]

I been using this phone for couple of months. This camera sensor something else for night time shoot. we can take really good pictures and videos . captures even the a small light source and makes the pictures bright. Only issue I have is with the front cam for some reason light correction not done correctly most of the times. Sometimes over exposed and we can see evident software color correction.

The phone is not value for money at all. There are several issues even in the newly purchased phone. Fast charging is the only advantage. Everything else sucks. Mute button gets accidentally pressed while.on a call despite locking the screen. When applications are running in case you receive a call at times you can't see the notification of the call and the on-screen option to pick or decline the call is not visible. Happened to me on several occasions. It's been just 15 days from purchase. Won't recommend buying the phone to anyone.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Good Design but without Glass body, but Weight is managed. Main Camera Dimensions Little bigger then usual i think of it is Given small so it's look more beautiful, camera is good blur video, dual video rec good features. Battery and 80 w Charger is best. If you got this in offer So that's It is Really Good. Underer 30K.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'conflict'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
After 4 months use my photos are getting deleted automatically not any to recover there were 1000+ and now I have only 26 pics in gallery. Tried in all method to recover no use. At first I thought may be by mistake something happen but again same thing happened it's almost furstrating me. Please, can you suggest me something for this all the pics are deleting this is my third time I'm really annoyed by this phone having such a good clarity of mobile but what's the use of it's getting deleted. I really wanted to give 5 star but now I'm annoyed####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
All the features are average but the battery is the worst, it diffuses on such a pace that it's difficult for you to keep this mobile while you are traveling. All though it gets charged instantly that is one of the fastest i have seen till now. But it's reversely proportional. The camera quality is average for this price, as you can get better quality in Realme smartphones as well at half the price. Overall i would say i made a mistake purchasing this mobile.####[['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Do not buy, I am facing issue, screen automatically turns on during call which effects call in many ways, like phone call button may click automatically due to touch of cheek during call. I face automatic mute/hold/call drop issue due to this problem and there is no solution for this.####[['software general', 'negative']]
I have ordered blue one but received green. Its takes a slight time to detect the fingerprint. Camera is not good at this price. The camera is boosting color too much.its seriously too much. It's my 1st time buying OnePlus.Really a bad experience####[['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Believe me the cameras are useless! Don’t get biased by seeing many reviews here(I think most are paid). Me myself ordered this phone and had to return this at any cost. I may not take this phone even this costs at 20k.  About speaker quality, let me explain, thankgod I found an issue, and the item got returned. DONT MAKE MISTAKE! Speakers sounds good and loud too BUT, when you increase the volume, the back of the phone tremendously vibrates and you start feel irritating.  So, If anyone buying this and has a requirement of camera and speaker, you shouldn’t opt this! Believe me, It won’t solve your minor requirement too!!####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
Looks ordinary, feels ordinary, both front and back camera are okayish. I don't know why people hyped one plus camera so much. I'd pay max 12k to 15k for this handset. Plus it's huge, feels like you've held a tab in hand. It's huge and thick, it has all the thickness for earphone jack but doesn't have one. If you've used pixel 4a kinda phones this handset feels like garbage in hand. It is only good to binge Netflix due to good battery back up and huge screen. Not buying one plus ever again. If you're planning to buy this phone then please think about it, you still have time.####[['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive']]

I have purchased this phone in 2023...Before purchasing I hv gone through lots of reviews of other phones as well on this price range around 30K...but finally decided to purchase this one coz a flackship experience on low budget, the camera is awesome, battery last 1 day on full charge normal use,software is upto date. Iam fully satisfied...go for this phone without any worries.

This phone could have been 10% cheaper than the current price. However overall a good package to go for where you get all S20 feature in a phone except a space zoom. Which i dont feel as a necessary feature. Also slight heating issue and Charger could have been the one with flash charging. Overall Camera quality. Speed and display are the plus points as well plus the screen size.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive']]
Really nice phone .Value for money.I am writing this review after using it for around 18 months.Camera super.I have used it while swimming under water it's a perfect waterproof phone.After using it in water dry the charging port otherwise it will not charge.Only constraint is battery life for heavy users.For light users it will last around 2 days but for heavy users maximum 12 hours. Finally I will suggest go for it####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'conflict']]
After 15 days of use, I must say, this one is worth! Nice speed and great performance! They have given android 13 and it's a Jan 23 make! Camera quality seems good and switching between the apps is also fast! The audio jack is absent, but they have not made it slimmer; hence, I feel, they should have given one. But as it's the flagship phone, it lacks the jack by default I guess.. It's a proposed water proof phone- so it's a good news! It has wireless power sharing and it works. Battery lasts satisfactorily with a few settings. As of now, it's giving me more than 2 days! Look is good and everything else seems fine.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'conflict'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
On a scale of 1 to 5, no matter which aspect you concentrate ,a minimum rating of 3.8 and up to 5 can be given. Camera is superb. Not for a hard-core gamer but best for a casual gamer, have been getting no lag gameplay for pubg at medium graphics and extreme framerate( medium graphics are enough for me).Been using it for 5 months and no issues so far what so ever. Amoled screen did not disappoint, it has been a great experience. Unexpected surprise was that the speakers are pretty good. Secure folder feature has been good for mirror apps. So if you want a phone with best overall performance, go for it, you won't regret it( I haven't so far)####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
A flagship phone by Samsung would never disappoint. Same is the case with S20 FE 5G. Noth me and wife use this model and are happy with the overall performance. I would not compare with either iPhone or Chinese manufacturers as Samsung has it's own class. If you don't update the phone everytime they push an update, be assured it's going to last a lot more than expected. I am happy with the performance, battrey life and responsiveness.####[['company general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]

Phone with standard quality compared to other Chinese counterparts.... Decent camera without any camera gimmics. You will get Raw pictures... Battery is not that good... For a medium user it will last a day... With a lower screen refresh mode it will last more. But i won't go for it as i prefer quality videoes and images. Good processor for a phone and i haven't tested it for gaming. No heating issues while charging but with mobile data and hotspot the area around the camera module heats up but not much for concern... Display is awesome as samsung provides best display. Stereo speakers give quality audio..Charging with provided 15 w charger juices up the device to a full by around 1h and 15 m.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive']]
Good in this price range with this kind of OS nd samsung branding along with a good processor too, bundled with a charger surprisingly, in short I would say a decent phone in this range, even providing many flagship features like wireless charging nd reverse wireless charging, good camera quality in day light, but average display in bright sunlight, hardly 404 nits brightness, 120hz refresh rate is amazing, video quality in uhd 60fps is magic, amazing sound quality with Dolby Atmos, but am missing that headphone jack, great to see ip68 rating in this range. In short good to purchase within 30000 but not worth more than that, as competition is very high nd market is vast.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]

Hi, I am using this phone from almost 3 Months. Earlier i was having Samsung M51 which was awsome in terms of battery and camera. Samsung S30 is a good phone in terms of quality but very very poor battery and average camera. This phones hanges some time. It should have dedicated memory card, space is limited. I will not recomend this phone.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['storage general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]

I was very happy with my purchase and fell so in love with the device that I even plunged into galaxy system eco-system and bought galaxy watch and wireless charger etc.  When all was going good, the phone display stopped working for no reason as I was scrolling thru the gallery images. The phone just blacked out on me. I was then travelling with wife and kid in a different state, and all my documents, tickets, receipt, contacts were saved in digital form in my phone. I was totally clueless what happened and how am I going to revive the display so that I can continue with my tour. Fortunately I forwarded all the tickets and Receipts to my wife's mobile and my galaxy watch had all my contact synced.  2 star for the samsung customer care for replacing the display in a day, being a premium customer.####[['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['company general', 'positive']]
I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.####[['hardware general', 'negative'], ['company quality', 'negative']]
The product seems to have a very common display Blackout issue requiring the display and battery to be changed... luckily for me it happened during warranty...then realised after searching for the issue online that for S20 FE it's a very common issue apparently for products sold during last great Indian festival sale...where in some cases Samsung had issued DOA and provided replacement...given that it's a known product issue on one of their galaxy series would have expected Samsung to have it resolved rather than causing inconvenience to customers buying their products####[['display general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I am a big fan of Samsung mobile but this model utterly disappointed me. 1. Battery life is not acceptable need to charge twice a day and also charging is too slow. I have another Samsung phone having 6000 mah battery it charges faster than this 4500 mah 2. Signal and connectivity issues are there. I have tested my sim in other make mobile I would easily get 4 to 5 Mbps speed but in Samsung only 900 Kbps was max at that particular location. Being a 5 G phone this is what not expected. 3. In display finger scanner is too slow and most of the time you need to scan for 2 to 3 times. 5 लोगों को यह उपयोगी लगा####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
Shame on samsung for this product. I am using samung from last 10 years. But this product is worst than worst . It's battery life is like hell. Battery life drain like storm. Other features are OK but what about battery life. It's like you have good food to eat but don't have hand to taste. Very much disappointed by this. If you have more than 3 hrs daily use, don't go for it. Amazon/samsung is cheating customer by not having return policy on it, otherwise every user will return this product. 2% battery drained during this review writing####[['company general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
Dear friends never purchase this online. Dealer send me first time dead phone then I returned it again they send used or refurbished phone. Phone charging is not properly.

Just awesome..the phone is rightly sized and absolutely mind blowing camera. I have used iPhoneX as well but feel this one comes close in terms of camera & stands out because of its price value. Build quality is good don't get fooled by its glass body, have been using it without case, the phone comes with the glass scratch shield which can be removed later.

Very good quality phone. But unfortunately phone started malfunctioning from 3rd of September. Charging port was not working. Eventually gave phone to Samsung service centre on 4th evening. As per them charging port needs to be replaced. Really disappointed with Amazon & Samsung. If a new flagship phone performs in this way how could we trust the brand. I don’t want to write anything negative, just a request please check quality of every product before selling. Presently my new phone is in service centre. Hopefully problem will be fix by them. Let see. Otherwise I need to contact with Amazon & Samsung for the solution.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]

First when I ordered this phone I was not sure about it. I had read a lot of reviews on the product and the seller found many negative reviews. When I ordered the phone it stated that I would get this phone delivered by the next day. But, the only issue I had was to wait for this product to get in my hand after 3 days. The phone is good quality. No scratches.. authentic product from Appario retailers.

Battery life is disappointing for a phone with 8GB RAM and 128 GB storage...go for a SPIGEN make case for phone protection...has a good grip...this phone is light weight with edge screen and most vulnerable to damages through fall...and very less protection cases available in the market to protect this phone...screen guard tempered glass would not fit for this phone as it is edge screen...so you have to go for the film only...overall classy phone but disappointing battery life####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]

Its a nice phones does everything a flagship is supposed to do.

Why does samsung stick to exynos processors for its flag ship phones beats me. Qualcomm processors perform better, photos are better. finger print scanner sucks badly and even after a update at the samsung center , it doesn't work properly. photos are a big let down and night time pics are hopeless and so are the low light pics. Even day time pics are grainy especially when you crop the pics 1:1. Battery doesn't let you down for a day with controlled usage. Overall not a good phone .

The phone keeps heating up for now reason! It's a brand new phone I received today.

That stops me from using my phone for anything!####[['phone usability', 'negative']]
Phone's battery was not at all charged when received, so I put it on charging. After charging, phone was switched on and started software updates. Then I noticed that back panel has started coming off. You can in the attached images and videos that phone's back panel is coming out, and pasting glue is visible also. This must be due to battery overheating and swallowing. This is an horrible experience. After paying premium price for dated model still getting defective piece is an nightmare. On top of that product is not refundable. I raised return request, Amazon says the engineer will visit to inspect first. God know what will happen. Big money seems wasted.####[['phone quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
If you are using your mobile for phone call or just 5-10 photos at a time then only go for this mobile. Otherwise the worst mobile available at this price range. Camera quality at good sunlight is excellent. But images taken without sunlight is worst than some other low budget phone.. If you install some applications or watch some videos on internet for 10 mins then you can use mobile to iron box . Battery will drain so fast. But fast charging is okay. It will change fast . It will take around 1.30 hr for 60-70% charge . There is not much lagging as if no.. But in my humble opinion never go for this phone. S10. May be some other variant might be good.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I opened the package about 5 mins back and it has heated up terribly.

While I am checking mails or try to check messages, it automatically get closed.  Whereas, I use to play DLS22 & RC22. Both games are running smoothly in "Medium" mode.

Build quality feels like below average. There is no grill in the earpiece. Don't know whether it is missing for the one i purchased or it is part of their design.

Oh, the mobile is hanging a lot. I wasted my money. Give me my money back. Deposit the money of the old mobile in it. And give all the money to me. And take your mobile.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Have brought this mobile 2months back for my father. With in 2months display is not working and when I reached out to service centre they are saying we need to pay the amount for the display even it is in waranty don't but this phone.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['phone warranty', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
If you use it for playing videos on social media like youtube , face book or Instagram don't buy it. This will test your patience. No matter how fast your internet is, this phone will get stuck and show loading all the time. Aa Instagram reel will not play without getting stuck midway. Sometimes it will not play even if we wait. Same goes for YouTube. Loading al the time. Even My infinix which is a cheaper phone never had this kind of issue. Waste of money .####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
This device doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor. This is waste of money. In this device fingerprint sensor , face scanner not available look like an old era mobile.

I am totally disappointed with this mobile.####[['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
1.There is no fingerprint scanner/ sensor..

It has only 2 Camaras so picture clarity is not so good but they are fine. It Has very good performance it runs call of duty on high graphics very smoothly. So far I have had no issues with this phone it is very light weight and it has nice grip while holding the phone if you are looking for a phone which is for gaming this is phone. It can free fire also in max graphics####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Overall product is good in this price with enough storage & RAM but camera quality is not much better. It's contains total 3 camera lens but I try to check using finger on cemra lens and I got result that only one main top lens is capturing photos. So if you are looking for normal usage purpose it's good deal but if you are looking for gaming & photos purpose it's not right deal for you.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Well I ordered this for my dad, And he just needs to use WhatsApp and Youtube and Make calls. I think everything will work fine but there Is just one problem that is Its charging speed. It has 22.5W charger though the charging speed is slow. But it is manageable so in 14k you cannot ask for anything better.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
I've been using only Redmi phones since Redmi Note 3 was released. First dissapoinment was this purchase. Very low media volume. No indicator light for charging or notification. Hardly any reviews and info online. On the plus side, good battery and processor, no heating, fast fingerprint sign in, feels good in the hand. Also bluetooth 5.3 with hd audio certification. Still, for a 12k phone this looks like a hasty package put out for marketing reasons rather than a fully thought through product.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
I won't recommend this phone to anyone. Received videos doest have sound, video takes ages to download despite so much memory space in phone. Battery dies in no time. Calling features are pathetic. If you are using two sim you won't know which SIM the gone is on with, also you won't see disconnect option after you finish the call and call can be on until the other person doesn't hang up. It's just not recommend phone. Also this is the last time i bought phone from Amazon. Return window closes in 7 days and issues can occur post 7 days too. PLEASE DON'T BUY N WASTE YOUR MONEY! Looks of phone is fine but if phone doesn't work well what's use of the look, we don't keep it in the museum!!####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]

You can play any eSports at 60 fps with better graphical settings under 15000 and you also get 12 gb (6+6) expandable ram and 128 gb storage too, it's enough space for a lots of games. 120hz display with snapdragon 4 gen 1 is best processor under this price range you can definitely go for this phone but the only drawbacks are you will face problem finding back covers for it and you can't play 4k videos on YouTube and it shows some stutters while playing 4k video even when the processor is able for 4k videos may be it can be solved in future updates.####[['phone operation_performance', 'conflict'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['memory design_features', 'positive'], ['storage design_features', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
I already had an adapter, glad to save the environment (don't know how that works). The phone is decent, gifted it to my dad who uses it mostly for calls and clicking pictures. Call recording without announcement was important for me but this phone came with google phone app which has announcement. I disabled it and used IQOO dailer and it works like a charm without announcer. 4+64 was sufficient for now. I can upgrade memory later and high RAM is not needed for non-gaming purposes.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive']]
Fingerprint sensor is awesome and battery life need should be little bit increase because nowadays 5000mah battery is not sufficient for us it should be 6000mah and above. Camera 50mp work quite well but front camera 8mp you have to increase it's not enough for selfie users and rear secondary camera needed more improvement because it is only 2mp macro camera. ...

What i mean it really do well and you guys will not find lag easily( till date i find none so good luck you guys finding faults) in this device and man i got to say its screen with 120Hz refresh rate feels good, camera is ok ok i mean its alright you can't expect iPhone in this price range no?####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral']]
Display is very good with 120hz refresh rate. Fingerprint scanner response is outstanding. Battery backup could've been a little bit better compared to a 5000 mAh battery. Camera quality is poor. 50MP is camera is poorer than 12MP camera of other devices, although this doesn't surprises me anymore. The mobiles we used to get at 8k-9k a few years back, are now available at this 12k-13k price range. Inflation buddy.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
The device is working phenomenally and the processor is just great. The only three drawbacks which I have come across are: 1. Poor Camera quality, its ok-ish. 2. High delay in Gyro (Something to be noted by gamers) 3. Although it has 18W charging speed which does the work for me but still 33W would have been great. Apart from this I am happy with the device. The battery backup is great, the screen quality is phenomenal with 120 Hz and the Snapdragon Gen 4 1 processor is working phenomenal.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
Charger should be provided with the phone even if it's entry level , mid range or flagship model, rest all features are good, camera is modest compared with the price it's been offered , battery life is too good.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
This phone is working very well as battery life is approx 2.5 days after normal use. Speaker quality is well finished and smartphone is as smooth as we expect. The only negative point I noticed it's front camera. It's not taking clear videos and photos as they could improve. But overall it's good to buy at this range for 5g category.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I've purchased this product just 15 days back and I hadn't seen any new feature at all like phone differentiation,etc but it's performance is better but the quality of camera and sound was poor and the processor speed was not so that much up as we expected.

Basic type phone with touchscreen features... Not worth it .. can use only WhatsApp.... Can't use Instagram or any other apps... Writing this review after 1 month of use....

Camera quality is not good enough. There's noise in your photo if the ambience light is somewhat dim. Selfie camera is not that great.

Camera app crashes a lot. Charging is pretty slow with just 20w charging support. Face recognition doesnt seem to work more than half of the time. Apps seems to slow launch after few days of use.

Mobile looks good but no camera clarity, either front nor back camera. 50mp camera they mentioned but it's not like 2mp, no clarity in photos complete blur and phone gets hang before inserting the sim and for pre installed apps also. Waste of money, and Amazon will automatically cancel the orders and raised technician visits for 2 times and stated there is issue but the customer service rep will tell complete opposite to the report, it is in good condition. Finally accepted for replace it but at the time of delivery, again it got cancelled as not in exchange condition, but no one called no one came to exchange the mobile, completely it's fraud they are playing with customer patience.

Fingerprint not available. Face lock is there. Battery life and camera quality is same as they mentioned. I chooses this only because of the memory size they allocated in this phone.

This is basically a Android Go edition phone which has a bigger screen, and a Decent processor. This is not a phone to expect a gaming experience but still can play games like Subway Surfers.

The best part is screen refresh rate and battery. It's far better than other smart phones bin this range. Camera is decent but it's okay in this range .

Phone is good, but not excellent. I bought a low cost phone as i keep breaking phones. Although this says 4gb Ram, 64 GB storage, latest processor etc. This phone lacks lot of options that were available in the phone i had bought 3 years ago. Its probably good for people who dont use phone as their daily necessity to work, compute, record and depend. The battery is 5k MAH, but doesnt last more than a day. no short cuts available for screen shot, flash light, calculator, speed ram, clean up. There is no option for widgets too that i needed badly on my phones. Anyways, as said its a basic phone and the color and screen size is good.

Camera quality is worst. But if you are looking for low budget phone so i can personally suggest this series. Overall performance with this budget is marvelous except camera. Even the camera of keypad phone is better than this. At the night time camera will capture totally blur/bubbled/dotted pic's, and at the day time camera is ok ok types but not at all good.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
I have purchased this device one week before seems performance wise its ok but major missing is finger print sensor and face lock doesn't work properly.

As an alternative to cheap and good quality redmi 6a , i decided to buy narzo 50i 6 months before.unfortunately, the performance really surprised me  1. Even with 2-3 apps open, the phone got hang and cache cleared automatically..means background apps will stop working  2. Phone calls are terrible experience ..the ringtone comes instantly and call will be displayed after 1 min...so thats the quality of basic phone call  3. Beta version of any app will crash because pf the poor processor performance and under utilization of the available ram  NEVER buy this product even for ur elderly one because it is cheaper/ budget friendly .they will curse you####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]

has basic camera.. no use at all. has 5000 mAh battery and no fast charging . so u will have to keep it charged. so its more like basic power bank which will take more time to charge. charging port micro USB not even type C touch is very bad. phone in pocket sensors does work. will have to disable it. So completely useless. speaker is mono but quality is below average or very bad. even calling page will take time to go from 1 page to another. Add some money to ur budget and go for better phone.

I regret buying this device to be honest. Rear camera is average, front camera is below average (photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better). Battery drains a lot even if you are not using the device, feels like 2-3k mah battery. Ram mangement is pathetic, can't even beat my 4 year old Samsung device with 4 gigs of ram. Device heats a lot when charging or doing normal tasks. The only good thing about this device is the perfomance.

Don't buy this phone if you're looking for gaming. Despite having a powerful processor, it's unable to handle most games. RAM management is very bad, so much that even 2 apps wont stay in ram sometimes. Minor heating issues occur and constant lags while gaming. Games stutter randomly and frequently. Sometimes even crash and a message pops up "System UI not responding"... UI also has a lot of minor bugs which really degrades the user experience. Not at all recommended for heavy users.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Not a good battery. Since am regular customer in redmi. Am not sure how come this product become worst in terms of battery.just 10days over to this phone and i visited to service center to check on this fault, they said no issue after keeping observation of 1day. But i could see same conditions as before. Now am frustrated on this phone to change this phone, I don't have replacement nor to change battery, Redmi has to understand this situation and request to come to me. Thanks####[['battery general', 'negative']]
Only thing good about this phone is it's battery which provides 6 hours of screen on time. Fingerprint sensor is not good, screen goes white most of time during calls. Dimensity 8100 Processor is overhyped not even close to snapdragon 855. Phone lags most of the time while using. Everything from Speakers & mic to camera & touch are average. MiUi 13 is worst UI. If u are stock Android user then this redmi k50 i is definitely not recommended , lots of ads & bloatware. My 3 years old OnePlus 7 still works way better than redmi k50 i.

One of the worst phone i have ever seen in my life in just 2 months the phone stopped working. Phone got switched off for no reason and unable to switch on and unable to access.it asking me to reboot but after that also not working.. service centre also not responding properly.. not worth for money and not working. Don't buy. Not working at all..####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
The phone is good. Battery life is excellent, in one charge the phone runs for approximately 24hours without any problem. Touch sensation is also amazing. Camera quality is average than other redmi phones of the same price. In daylight good pictures come but during night a bit blurry. Wifi connections is a bit poor and i have faced issues several time with the wifi connectivity of the phone. Sometimes the network itself goes down slowing work process but i expect that this issue will be solved once 5g is launched####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
The phone is awesome (in performance, battery, camera, almost everything). Don't understand why people have given negative reviews above. Has several pre - installed apps, but most of them can be uninstalled, which gives you a clean and clear UI. Network and battery performance is awesome. Camera is also good enough. Obviously you can't get everything perfect in this price range. Overall, great phone. Recommended.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
like my phone very much, great device. Camera is not too good nor too bad, its capture good enough pictures in day light but night photos have some noise in pictures. Its camera only click details picture if click with flash light, otherwise some area are not focused..####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
The battery life is excellent in this phone. 5000mah live up to the expectations. Bought it for my father and he is very happy with this phone. He primarily uses it for Facebook, whatsapp, Video calls, youtube and regular business calls. Had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using the maps to navigate the signal stays strong even in rural areas. Wifi connectivity and audio Quality is also very good in this.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
I see a lot of experts comment here. They use this platform show their expertise. They compare it with a Nikon DSLR for camera, battery life with a car battery and display with that with a smart tv. Go for any mobile. Just see the features you need. A basic camera, reasonable 4000 to 6000 mAH battery. I have not found any such negativity described here. My mobiles last for more than 2 years irrespective of any brands.####[['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
It is a regular phone. You don't expect smartphone experience in this phone. It's camera is not great. Front camera is bad. Ram management and battery performance is poor. Network reception is poor.

Very poor performance.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Wifi on this mobile is very weak. All other mobiles show good wifi signal however 11 prime shows good but connection speed is 1 to 6 Mbps. I am talking about 2.4 hz bandwith reception. I dont know if its a hardware issue or software, apps wont download & youtube wont play if you aren't sitting next to wifi. I was able to place a replacement order but the replacement handset also had same problem finally called amazon customer care and raised a return request. Its a standard procedure to first raise a replacement request and then a return request of the problem persists. Those who use wifi should not buy this phone otherwise its a fair phone at this price.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Lookwise good. But only lookwise. Sound quality not loud like other phones. Camera is pathetic. Not even class of 13mp. Fingerprint sensor set on start button. Unless you press any key and on the screen if you touch your finger to sensor screen lock will not open. Face lock is better option. Battery is good. As I brought this as my secondary phone only for calling and WhatsApp for my second number not using it harshly to test battery performance.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'negative']]

Camera Quality is not good. I took pics of function but it takes the pic as dark faces. Its camera quality is very bad even below Rs.8000 phones have good quality than this mobile. Don't buy it. Due to my accident I was not well and not able to see my phone properly upto 10 days of delivery. When one function came then I realised and felt insulted after taking pics. So time passes away otherwise I would return within the return time.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Overall Phone performance is good, but there are many MI apps which you can't uninstall and those all default apps that used your mobile data quickly. The camera is mentioned 50 megapixels but it captures the photos in daylight very bad and not so clear, and night vision is even worst. seems like 5-megapixel camera. MIUI is worst even that not allow us to hide apps in the drawer or not allow us to make folder groups of apps. Don't buy it if you are buying it for camera purposes.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]

I use this phone from 1 month. I don't recommend this phone to buy anyone. It's camera not good, battery life not good, wi fi signal very low, wi fi connect only when signal above 3 to 4 level. 0 to 2 level it's wifi not connect but same time other phone wi fi connect. Data network very bad. It's stopped any time in video streaming but same time other phone on same network streaming video. It's software not optimised, if you use your phone you know that there are more bugs in software included. Call recording not available because it's use google dialer. Phone lags everywhere because miui consume it's full ram. Ram expansion feature not working, It's only marketing. Phone camera lags when click pictures. With flash light it's camera take more time to capture photo, very irritating. Without any app open it's cleaner show to clean cache files about 2 gb, don't know where it's generate cache in background. System loading always, waiting for app list show, very bad software.

The quality of the power button is very poor. I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023. When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device (As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped, hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost. I told them that there was no crack on screen or dent on any other part of the phone and asked them to write in writing that they confirm that the phone was dropped. However the service centre refused warranty claim citing company policies.####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone warranty', 'negative']]

The camera quality is not more than 10-12mb other compared camera. The customer service is pathetic. Within 2 days, none of them is ready to provide support for replacement with other brand or return of money. For them there is no technical defect so will not support. How can anyone know before buying that the mentiones quality is not upto the mark. WASTE OF MONEY at this cost.

I have used this phone only for 7 days. Both the camera quality is very bad. Front camera pictures are too poor quality. Battery charging is too late , tools more than 2 hours to full charge.

Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal. Its buttery smooth, no lag what soever, camera is top notch like its top quality. I thought it would take time to get adjust to its OS but for me it was no problem. I thought I would miss many feature from android but tbh most of the androids features are gimmicky and I only ever miss multitasking from android. But then again I am going to a very budget phone so i dont really know the true extent of android flagship phone but then again if you are going to pay premium price for a phone why not a Iphone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'negative']]
As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera(highly impressive video quality), battery life(normal use-more than 10hrs,Gaming-4-5hrs), performance(best). But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge(good factor-it takes 30mins for 50percent charge). Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming.writing this after 6months usage.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately. This phone is perfect for all, whatever you need you can get from this device. Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb. Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7-8hrs of backup. Build quality is superb. The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate, Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it, rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate. And guys i love the notch so sorry about it i can't comment on this.

It is an amazing phone, the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones, it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6-7 hours screen time which is decent (depending upon how you wanna use your phone, i use mine primarily for work, emailing, googling, watching videos and all). The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow, this is my switch from android to ios for the first time, although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great, total value for money (got it for 62k)####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['os general', 'negative']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos, just go for it. A15 bionic is super fast and it has amazing performance it is specially good for gaming although battery backup is not that good if you are a heavy user, but if you are a light or medium user it will give you battery backup of whole day in one charge.####[['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive']]
I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed. Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only .####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its apple (we shell not talk about worth of money) Edited review After using it 2 months -: battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90% and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30% after 4 hours so battery is good enough….

Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement. Android users may find the security annoying..I did....biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book. Audio(Stereo )quality is awesome for a phone. Battery will last 1 day for average users .....jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks (on Android) is a bummer....but security is security .No 4k for cinematic ....####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
A good phone for which you might need to sell your kidney. Battery life is decent, user interface is same as of Android, camera quality is decent but if I am going to spend 70k on a phone for camera, I better spend it on a DSLR.

I paid 73,000 for a phone but they don't give a charger! Thats so cheap about apple. Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste. Good decision. If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger, then why they need to produce new phones in the first place? To cut down waste and save environment, they can stop producing phone as well, right? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention. My 2 stars is not for the phone, but for their cheap tactics to cheat people.####[['company general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]

"I never thought that I would receive such a bad iPhone from Amazon when I ordered it online. My iPhone is taking extremely blurry photos and it heats up quickly, within 10 minutes of using Instagram or snap. when I called customer service for a replacement,they refused to exchange it directly. This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it. I thought the camera would be great, but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating. I bought it for Rs. 60,499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13."

I bought this phone keeping in mind that apple phone has very powerful processor,but it looks like at this price I could have bought a better android phone.This iPhone 13 has very serious heating issues. Only after 15 minutes of gaming or video recording,the phone starts heating up to the point where it gets very uncomfortable to hold it. So please think before buying this phone.Total waste of money. Not worth the hype.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Thought that at least I phone won’t hang but it’s been only 1 month I bought it and it started hanging already and it’s been 3rd time in a month. Wasn’t able to access any app not even able to move between the screens. Ultimately I had to shut down my phone and restart it again. Then what difference iPhone made when compared to an android phone. Really pathetic, annoying and disgusting to experience this kind of things from an IPhone.

Good quality..The camera is also really good but could be improved..The body of the mobile feels good and lightweight..The display is great and sharp with good refresh rate.

I excitedly bought this phone along with a new Jio sim to finally harness 5G. I checked the factors of price, specifications, and so on to decide on a new phone, and this one was the clincher. It is overall a fine smartphone. My friends had lots of good things to say about it. I personally love its battery life.  I had a little bad experience with gaming with it though... I was playing Efootball 23 and the operations in-match weren't working at all. It was frustrating.

I have a very low opinion on Indian products due to the quality standards but this phone beats my opinion. Looks very premium and slim . The phone comes with 4 GB and 6 GB RAM , I would suggest to go for 6 GB RAM as it can process more information at much faster rate without any heating issues .

The battery backup, performance and battery are best part. I'm using this from about 2 months no problem is found and it is fully made in india.

But it's definitely a good 5G phone at this price. Design is superb, but speed of the phone is not upto 5G expectation. Camera is good I can say.

Let me start this review by talking about the battery, which is the main aspect of this device. Despite taking a bit longer than usual to charge, this monstrous 5000-mah battery proves that it is a Nokia in disguise. The camera quality is good in UHD mode, the only mode I recommend. When it comes to performance, being awestruck is inevitable, as this is the epitome of software optimization. But too much multitasking slows down the device, which is normal for a device that boasts only 6GB of RAM. This device's HD+ IPS display and an impressive speaker will let us zone out of our surroundings and plunge into the world of never-ending bliss. The benefits we get from this device are unbelievable for the price we are paying. You will never regret this purchase unless you are in the chase for the posh.####[['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I used it for 5 days ,, lookwise, phone is best , good phone in this range, but ,as part of 5G connectivity, it is more disappointed me it's wifi. 5G works only through sim , but it's wifi band is 4G ,not 5G. if u connect it's wifi with 5G router or 5g hotspot it's speed is slower than 4g . Refresh rate is not to good as 90 hz., screencast is given on slides bar but it is disabled & not works, either not connecting tv if u use any other app from playstore. Bluetooth connectivity very poor, takes many times to search any divice . But Some parts of phone is good ,like display, finger sensor, charging speed, app install very fast,####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
I bought this LAVA phone hoping for quality and features, but I lost interest as soon as I held it.  1. This product is overpriced for its quality. A fair price would be 6k or 7k for this quality. 2. I liked the idea of Clean Android (No Bloatware), but I was surprised that there was no gallery app. I could only view my photos and videos in google photos, which I did not like. The camera quality was also poor. 3. The refresh rate is unsatisfactory. It leads to jerky and sluggish movement when I browse or slide.  Disappoint with the Indian phone. Hope they get better or if they want to continue, please sell it at lesser price.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]

इसके जैसा घटिया फोन मैंने पूरे जीवन में नहीं देखा। ये सोचके फोन लिया कि भारतीय कंपनी है और इतनी कम कीमत में कुछ अच्छा ही दिया होगा लेकिन पैसे बर्बाद। इसमें इंटरनेट की स्पीड ना के बराबर है। कुछ भी प्ले करो वो बीच में ही बंद हो जाता है। ना तो डाउनलोड होता है ना ही कोई गाना या स्टोरी सुन पाता हूं परेशान हो गया हूं। बाकी चीजें ठीक हैं लेकिन यदि नेट ही सही से ना चले तो बाकी फीचर का क्या अचार डालूंगा। बिना नेट के तो मोबाइल कचरा ही होता है।####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]

Very Bad Experience about this phone, after completely one month this gets hanged and while video playing on YouTube screen automatically paused and phone is automatically get restart and noises then this phone's motherboard gets changed. Then after 2 week again call from care centre and says your need software....this is basically reasons and others drawbacks are remaining....####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
Good phone with decent performance. There is need for improvement regarding selfie camera. Due to software problems it doesn't allow easy transfer of files from memory card to phone memory. There's error saying"error unknown" I hope lava software development team will work on it and fix issues and release a new update####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Light weight, sleek awesome samsung galaxy note. Awesome display, outstanding camera, s pen with sleek handset is very and unique and probably this is the last phone released which is both light weighted as well as s-pen note features. The other Note phones are too heavy with 6.7 to 7 display. Only Slight negative is battery life, but it is also OK with me bcz of small battery the phone is light weighted which is more important to me.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative']]
Samsung Note 10 is epic device offering premium experience. However, necessary accessories to upgrade the phone to that feel are to be purchased additionally which come at a steep premium. For example, the clear back cover bundled with phone once replaced with LED flip case or Clear Display flip cover transforms the handling experience. Absence of 3.5 mm audio port is disappointing. It appears to be a strategic move from manufacturers to lure users buy additional gadgets like wireless earbuds ! Many of useful accessories are still not available in India. USB type-C to 3.5 mm audio port adapter is yet to be released. 45W Fast Charger is not bundled in phone box and still not available in markets even after three months of launch of Note 10 series. Wireless charger/power bank purchased separately from Samsung is also disappointing as it heats up while charging and drains in no time. Apart from few of these accessories related cons, Note 10 experience is super fantastic and hopefully will last long.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I have been using samsung from past 7 years and have tried galaxy y, galaxy S, galaxy A series, galaxy edge and now promoted to galaxy note 10. Best about the phone is its picture, voice and audio clarity. I am really excited using my s pen it has so many features making my life very easy at work and fits perfectly in my palm. Completely in love with this.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive']]
My first flagship phone. Chose to buy this over iPhone because of its design, display quality, the incredible S Pen, and other additional features. The phone has amazing performance and build quality. Battery drains fairly quickly but the fast charging makes up for it. Front camera and Night mode could have been a bit better though.####[['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
What a superfast mobile...i m using one plus 8 mobile and samsung note 10 plus is a secondary device. But trust me samsung note 10 plus is faster. In 2020 also it is best Mobile to buy. Stylus pen work excellent. Great display and i have never thought that about 90Hz or 120 Hz refresh rate. Samsung note 10 plus is excellent in 2020 also. Its a beast...loved this and now using as Primery cell.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
I got this phone from Amazon for 50 k in Dec 2020.. If i bought it at its original price, seriously this would have been a downer for me.. This phone is good (despite lower screen size) preferred this one of 10+ series. The best feature is its form factor and display. But if I do a comparison with my sister's phone (one plus 7T pro), the battery is an area samsung seriously need to look at. The screen display is awesome and hence would need a minimum 4000 mah and this is really irritating since even without much use, my phone needs charging in 5 hours. Moreover given its refresh speed rate, I expect issues of lag in the future. But for me the battery is seriously something Samsung sucks at.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Here is my Review after one month of use.. 1, Battery Backup 5 star. 2, Camera 3 star out of 5. 3, Processer Speed 4 star out of 5. 4, Sound Clearity 5 Star. Redmi is a Good Brand I Liked it very much. I loved it's Battery Backup even if I watch online Videos for 2 to 3 Hours constantly battery Percentage decrease only 8 to 10 percent from 100 percent if you want good battery backup phone just go for it..####[['company general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
this mobile is good at price of 6k. build is good, display is good, call quality good, battery good, processor is for light use like facebook light, instagram lite, whatsapp etc. not for heavy app. for daily task it is good. youtube dont work smoothly, i think there should be any youtube light version. guys this mobile is only for old people who dont do much heavy work. for youngster it is not too good. camera front cam is good. back cam need improvement especially when we record video it shows black shadow, no bright view it need software update. overall at this price point it is good. but only for basic users. heavy users dont think about it.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]
The phone looks good. I received it 2 hours before. After basic installation of sim card and everything I am now trying to locate the flashlight. I even checked some YouTube videos. There no proper instruction manual. I had to spend two hours to find out flash flash light hidden at the behind the notification screen which shows up when you click 'edit' icon.####[['phone design_features', 'neutral']]
I have been using this phone for two months. According to the price range, the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good. According to this range, the camera is also fine. If we look at the performance, then it is not useless at all, but it is okay. I did not face any problem in calling. The phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps. If I give my opinion then this phone is good for parents.... If you want to buy this phone, then you should compare it with Poco C31, for now there is not much difference in the price.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
I bought this for office use. Has good battery life. And basic features of android work fine. However, I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition. I don't mind using it. But some features are missing (which most people might not use). Better than Nokia c01 which has Android 11 Go Edition, and on website there is not mention of any update. So, on a budget of 6k you can definitely but this one.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'positive'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Writing this review after 24 hours of rigorous usage. Got the phone delivered yesterday. Phone is good for a low end use. You can definitely purchase it in case you want to use it as a backup phone. To be honest, I have purchased for the same reason. Phone is over all good. Yeah, it lags a little. Also, the video quality is not that good, but definitely you can use it for a temporary watching. Overall picture quality is satisfactory. The only major issue that I have faced is that while making any of the WhatsApp, Viber calls, the voice comes from the top speakers instead of the earpiece so it might be an issue in case if you want to talk something personal in a public place.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
This device is good for them who are looking for a cheap secondary device. At this price, it is a good option can't complain but Xiaomi could have given the Helio p35 instead of four years old slow Helio A22. The Miui-launcher Go crashing like hell. Hence I have to uninstall it. I installed the Nova launcher, now it's working fine. I uninstalled all pre-installed Xiaomi cleaner apps, and music apps. It's my secondary device so it's okay for me. Not using that much, occasionally only####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for my parents, and they loved it as they use it only to make calls and use social media, which do not require a lot of RAM. For heavy usage, this phone is not ideal, but for calling and having the feeling of a big good phone, you should buy this device.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative']]
I ordered it as I am a light user. I only use Chrome, YT, WhatsApp, Zee5. For these apps 2GB Ram is enough. I have been using those apps in Samsung On5 1.5 GB Ram since 2016, that too smoothly. But this phone may have some manufacturing issues I guess. This phone seems slow even in normal usage, forget the heavy usage, time lag in every action you do. Tap on any app icon, be it Chrome or YT, never opened immediately. Bit problem with Haptic feedback too. Moreover, you can't install full version Amazon app in in this phone, only a light version is supported which is less than 1 MB runs through Chrome. You can not use "Chat Right Now" feature of Amazon in light version.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
I wanted a cheap phone as temporary basic, im not Android user for long and so did not like a lot of thing. Performance - it's slow like what you get with 2 gb ram,but not lagging playing YouTube or Spotify. I don't expect to perform this phone great so I'm neither disappointed. It has a large screen and it's not bad at all,I would be happier to see a smaller screen though. Camera, unsure why it has 2 camera and what they do , let's not use the camer! It's just a basic camera that capture photos if there's lot of light and the object dont move Battery is decent, actually there's nothing much I can do with this phone to drain the battery It dose make decent call.####[['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
Overall okay, but very dissatisfied with speakers. I placed on full volume, but am barely able to hear videos from Youtube, etc. Also, the sound quality during phone calls is muffled. I can barely hear the otherside of the conversation. I have placed the volume on maximum, but still no difference. Otherwise, okay for a budget starter phone.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Phone is very slow, very hard to run even one app like YouTube. I bought it for my father just to see some videos in YouTube in his free time, but it's very slow. Thery were saying it's 2 gb I don't think they are giving even half gb ram. Playing with people innocence.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative']]
The battery is said to be 5000mah, however it must be of such a poor quality that it starts degenerating exponentially after the first use. RAM is much lesser than what is promised in the description which causes the mobile phone to glitch consistently. Image/photo quality is extremely poor. Much more advanced mobile phones are being produced by other companies and are being sold for roughly the same price as this one.####[['battery quality', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
Do not buy this phone, keeps on hanging and you can't run YouTube in it. Not you can make calls properly. It will close apps automatically. Worst phone from redmi and it doesn't have return policy, you would have to replace and buy the same phone again. Amazon is making fool out of its customers just sell and and finish off the stock.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
It's a perfect set for travellers and a person who all are working till late hours as it's battery life is great and in another hand it's picture quality is very good even with a low light and front is places just at the centre which makes comfortable at the time of video chat/conference in my opinion it's a perfect phone for all####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive']]
Its value for money for sure. To be honest I am not a person who likes to play games on phone. Lets be serious, for that we have PS. Isn't it. Apart from occasional lags and flickers (once in a month, when battery is lower than 10%) you won't be having any issues. Camera is best in class. To verify it...I have attached few images. For me Hands down, VALUE FOR MONEY.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
Except for 90 hz display this phone is a beast. For camera, it can beat any other smartphone out in the market. It has a video bokeh which works very well and optical image stabilization. I just loved its optical image stabilization. It can even record at 60fps for 1080p. Every single feature that you can think of, it has that.

I've using it since 2 years now and I'm happy with the purchase. At first didn't want to buy it but I needed a good camera phone and I'm glad I chose it. Day light camera is just unbelievable and night camera is also good as you can see that in photos I've submitted below. Battery chargers fully in half nd hour. And backup is also long throughout day. Sound video everything is great. Would recommend to buy. And not a paid review but yeah really happy with phone.

I was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all, but for 28k, this is one of the best phones in the segment.  I had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options. Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects, the performance, the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible. Also Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it's a plus point.  The only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz. It starts to act as it lowers to 30,40 fps or something. And the battery life is average. It's 1 charge in the evening for sure. But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough. I use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style. Recommended to all.####[['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The value for money of this product at a price of 26k is really good. Although I exchanged my old smartphone to get to this price point but even if it retails for 28k or 29k it is hands down the best smartphone to go for but if your top priority is user experience you should rather go for nothing phone 1####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The phone ticks all the right boxes in all the categories. like good camera, decent battery life, good in hand feel. Phone looks little big, but you wont have any issue while handling it. overall i would say, its the best phone at 26K. Just go for it, you wont regret.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
The Funtouch OS is perfectly optimised with Google. Camera Quality is one of the best both rear and front. There are various modes available to capture pictures. Night Vision is the best thing. It doesn't boost images and the AI is much better. Gaming experience is also better. Smoother frames, no excessive heating Battery lasts almost entire day. Around 5.5-6hrs of screen time if fully charged. Charging is the fastest. Takes around 35-40 mins for 0 to100 percent charge. Processor and all other aspects are upto the expectation mark.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
Idk why people give 1 2 stars complaining the battery life, maybe they dont have life outside mobile. The phone is literally good in all aspects, never expected such a beautiful camera, ordered for performance but the cam was deadly both front and back. Battery life is good too. 4-5hrs of PUBG and 8hrs of normal use its good. Like if you are an addict please change the lifestyle, have life outside phone. Everything is good from the OS to foot. And heating issue is that use in room temp or outside conditions its good otherwise it does heat a bit with 888 processor. But if you want both camera and performance its great. No lag in PUBG hotdrop bootcamp with recording. Remove bloatware and customize to your comfort. This phone rocks!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['os usability', 'positive']]
So let's start with performance I get stable 60 fps on Apex legends and CODm and in fight it drops to 57-60fps. The camera is very good at this price segment even better than One plus 9RT. The battery drains a little fast but it with updates it would be fixed most probably. Also the battery performance doesn't bother me much. Since I use the phone it drops to 40 and in 20mins it's full charged. 0-100 takes 35-40 minutes.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
Firstly I want to confess that Iqoo 9 se is Best processor in low budget..It is an Flagship Phone So Easily you can use it for more than 3 years. Back Camera is Quite Good but front is Ok not bad you can Ok with it. Battery is too Awesome you can easily used it for whole day. They are Providing you 65 watt changer So you can get full in just 30 mins. Display is tooo tooo good You feel like awesome by using it and it not affect your eyes as well. Sensors are too good Finally I can say that buy a Iqoo 9se is quite better than Banded Flagship Phone####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I Gifted this phone to myself on my birthday on 15 Aug 2022. Really awesome phone, Battery drianed fast during installation of apps and restoration of data however was amazed by the charging time, it just took 20 minutes to charge the battery from 0 to 80%. Touch is working very well, Shifted from Samsung to Iqoo hence you will feel slight difference in brightness. Didn't feel heating issue. BGMI is working smooth. Camera quality is good. I was initially in dilemma wheather to buy a Non branded phone or not, but due to flagship features Iqoo is offering at lower price I went ahead and bought it. Really happy with the product. This phone has exceeded my expectations.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Using this phone for 4 days now and it's performance is top notch. Haven't faced any heating issues as of now. Not even during game play. It gets slight heated but cool down even faster. Battery could have been a bit better. Not disappointing though. Giving me enough juice for a day. Charging speed is very good which kind of compensates for the battery backup. Camera is decent. Haven't tested it to the limit. Design and in hand feel is excellent. Doesn't feel heavy. Display is just amazing. Dual stereo speakers could have been louder. But they are decent. If you have a budget of 30-35k, go for it.

If you want to grab the beauty of android then you have to have a powerful phone otherwise same lag, slow applications opening will be there for you. But here with this one u will have a beast in your hand, dont go with the statement that 888 heats a lot, because here you won't find any heating issue, normal heating is there for every smartphone. Display of this device is awesome, I mean you can comoare it with some flagships of Samsung also. Camera quality is more than average but it can be improved through OTA updates.

I bought this phone it's an excellent phone but for the gaming experience I would deduct one star ,if the company in future make an update of better gaming may be it would be good for gaming but for now it doesn't support 90 Fps in bgmi and has heating and frame dropping proplems..I don't know from wich side it is ,iqoo says it's from game side and bgmi says it's from your device side...

The phone is good and okay for the price it offers. Rear camera has is okay just as we see in vivo phones and gives pictures with true colour, sometimes the background such as blue sky or light colours tend to appear white If u use AI. Selfies are bit grainy but its okay. The 888 SoC is okay but it is no where near 8 Gen 1. The games lags at full definition. Multi tasking is sometimes sluggish showing loading for fraction of seconds. Overall good but if u can strech the budget go for 8gen 1+####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative']]
Every thing is nice the best phone in the given price bracket but th only problem is battery life . It takes only 6 to 7 hrs to drain if continuous gaming is done . Otherwise it is nice can last upto 1 and a half day . But if you consider the fast charging which actually charges the phone In less than 30 mins it sums up for that given disadvantage . Funtouch os 13 is also very smooth and gives a stock android feel .####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
Before buying this phone, i researched about this phone a lot. Now after a two week of usage of this device, this is a monster for this price range . All the review i read about this phone before buying was heating issue, screen flickering, and battery. I will clarify about this issues. First is screen flickering - we can't able to experience any type of flickering issues with normal eyes. It can only see through other cameras. About 70 percent smart phones have flickering in low brightness. And will be fixed with update. Second is heating - no heating at all for me for normal use and heavy usage like just every other phones heating. While charging it will heat up. Its 66W charging( not 10 W charging.). Every phone with high wattage charge will heat up. Third is battery- yes battery draining is there. But with 66W charge you will not able to realise the battery draining. Now a days phones with high wattage charger has battery draining. Thats not an issue. Overall blindly go for this phones at this price segment. Its a worth buying .TRULY ITS A MONSTER####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Its a gaming phone I didn't find the camera particularly good many oppo realme phones have almost the same quality. If you want camera in this range then go for the Samsung fe series. And fingerprint scanner i find it bit off and rest it's a great budget phone in this range. But if you are looking right now the wait for the iq10 im sure it will come soon with gen1 processsor.####[['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Everything thing is good and it is more than enough for daily operations at this price range. The only problem with this phone is output sound from speakers whoch isnot that good.If you talk outside or watch movie it is not loud enough.camera is too good.Batery life is also good.Phone is having heating problem when you use camera 10 minutes continuously but it is common issue in 8 series Snap dragon processor.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
I brought iqoo 9 se 12gb varient on 2nd of may at 26000 after exchange and discount. Ad 888 Little heat but good. I dont know why in premium segment 2 mp camera is given. Its of no use. 2nd it has slightly low builed quality if i compare it with other brands in this price range. Within three months i gone for its screen replacement which costs 6800. Performance wise it is a great phone , camera ok but not too good. And as i said earlier you have to compromise with its build quality. In future i am not going to buy any iqoo brand.####[['cpu general', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Average rear camera on both night and day time. Good display, brightness is ok, no flickering at all, stereo speakers are ok, front camera is superb, rear camera for just a photo is good, but for videos the setup is worst, jitters and overprocessed looks, call quality is awesome, connectivities are very good, processing is speeding is fast as expected, bloatwares are not so much intimidating, you can uninstall most of them turn off notifications for the rest, battery backup is ok, for a office guy this backup just enough, charging speed is around 40-50 min, iam no gamer, so i don't know about the gaming experience, overall a good choice for me. By the way the looks are nice, and i didn't feel this as a hefty phone may be because i have big hands.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
Phone is very good, no other words in performance , battery drained very quickly Camera: good but there is no much option like other brands Battery: worst ( below 20% it works heavy slow) Performance: very good####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Display Quality is the worst even tho it's amoled display. It have snapdragon 888 and it get soo hot even when we use whatsapp video call. And it drains battery so fast. My previous phone was Poco f1 even after 3 years it never let me down. This device just disappointed me from the first month of using. I even replaced this once because of display issue but it can't be fixed because they using cheaper amoled display in this device.####[['display quality', 'negative'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative']]
This is the best phone u can get under 30k if you consider performance although it's also good In others aspects like media consumption and camera. The only issue o face with it is the battery backup since it has 4500mah battery we can't expect much also the 888 has higher tdp. Overall it's a good Phone.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative']]
I really excited initially to get this phone but once I get it, I am so disappointed to see it's battery performance. What is the use of high RAM if battery drains this much quick. Please note I never downloaded any games these are just normal apps. Camera is very good though.####[['battery quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
I'm using IQOO 9 SE 5G since 7th August22. This is genuine review, display-camera-speed all good but battery life really sucks. I need to charge the phone twice a day to fullfill battery requirement else my phone can dies at anytime. Call clarity sometime not good & disconnect the call inbetween at the same other my phone call connectivity is smooth. I would not say to buy this phone but please fix battery & call smoothness issues.####[['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Phone is getting over heatted while charging Time and we use camera for long time it getting closed automatically woest experience with Amazon even my friend using the same phone he haven't worried with any of these issues I think this phone is facing some problem Amazon service is not responding at all####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
I just got delivered the phone. After phone setup while using it as the daily driver (no gaming) the phone is heating up near the camera area. I have seen the reviews on YouTube, they also said this about the heating issue. It's quite strange to me despite having liquid cooling etc phone is heating on daily tasks operations. Kindly if someone at IQOO reading this kindly fix the issue. Else everything (hardware) is fab at such price point####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
I am giving rating of this mobile 1 out of 5 because when I received this item it's look like used mobile and I noticed some lagging issues some times when I open the apps it's automatically closed and stuck at middle of the working and also the main issue I noticed battery draining issue when I watch the 2 minutes youtube video it is taken 10% charge it's immediately decrease the battery.I am very very dispointed when I try replace the item they are not replaced they tell your moible is working fine.i am facing this worst experience in Amazon .####[['phone quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
Product is very good it has many new features. But i didn't like this camera bcz when we click pic we see some black outlines, camera quality is not too good and volume also, when we put volume on half we can't hear anything,And battery life is very long we can use this mobile minimum 9/10 Hours Easily without Any hang But I Like this product which were purchased in budget####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I believe it's priced a little bit on the higher side but still it's better than its competitors. Display is less bright than I hoped, with okayish resolution. I have put it on 'Performance boost' 24/7 mode which reduces battery life but it does feel a bit more snappy and fast. It doesn't feel premium in the hand but it's '4 camera layout' tricks others that it's a Rs12000+ phone; atleast from afar.####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
This phone is worth buying at this price.It is very handy and the battery backup of the phone is excellent.And the fingerprint reader is also very smooth and fast.The look of phone is very attractive. So I must recommend to buy this amazing phone.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The user interface is not as smooth as it should be right now, but I feel the updates might fix it... and as per mentioned specs, it works well. The thing is you cannot expect world class performance on heavy usage in this price range. It does my work so that's why 5 stars.####[['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The phone is pretty good. The back design of the phone is very old sorta. Not that good. The fingerprint reader is cool. The phone started lagging at some points instantly. But it's all because it's 4gb ram. Camera quality is equal to whats expected from this phone. So it's okay. Overall it's a pretty decent phone. I would recommend it for elderly people.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'neutral']]
I only disliked the look and size of the phone .In the pictures , the phone looks very stylish , bit in reality, it is not .It is shown that it has a screen size of almost 6.53 inches. I measured it so it came almost 6.21 inches. I only took the phone because it was cheap ,else I would return it .####[['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
This phone is decent at this price point but I think the processor they are providing is not up to the mark with this phone.Main Advantages of this phone is that 1GB virtual ram is also provided by Redmi.Lokks wize it is good those parallel lines they are providing is pretty cool.Build quality is decent. Although it is an 4 on 5 phone.I recommend you to buy this phone on sale for extra discount and offers.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]
The very Basic Feature like Batter Charge Indicator Led Light that also serves the purpose of indicating Missed Calls or Un-seen Messages is missing. Block Messages based on keywords is missing, Blocked Calls UI interface could've been better implemented/organized. Its not handy. Charging time is very high approx 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. Otherwise, Average to below Average phone.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Although most of things about purchase can be considered decent given the price I paid for it but the most unjustifiable problem with the phone was it's performance. It's hella slow for a phone a with 4gb ram and opens everything too late. The redme 9A sport I bought for a relative has a better performance with only 2gb ram. I first thought it's just happening because we're setting it up but it persisted and is still quite slow. Also the fingerprint sensor is also not that responsive. Overall Average to poor experience. I got it for 7k but I would recommend to go for something else if you want to spend 7k or more. Thank you.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
This mobile appearance is good, battery life is good, touch screen is very good, when we came up to the performance of apps and camera quality is very poor even selfie camera gots blur. Speaker sound is Even low.Even we can type something in chrome it's taking lot of time to loads the page. Today geting my order despite that Within 3hrs this mobile makes me anger and never spent money for this mobile. And another one thing someone used this mobile I think he leave his LinkedIn auto filling gmail address. For privacy Here I won't mention that x person id.

Smart Phone are costly junk, that gets corrupted whatever brand it is, they last for 2 years and costly service. Now the company is reusing the components from exchanged ones and gradually removing features to more costlier ones which were expected to be basic. This phone has touch screen problem for the reason I purchased new one####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
I ordered this phone and it's hanging and switching off by itself. So I tried to replace the phone. But they arranged a technician to visit me for the second time and the second time the technician called me and said he can't come to my place. So I called the customer service and there is no positive support for me to replace the phone. Its been one week since I am facing this problem. Very poor service by amazon####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
Sad to say that this is not great handset, can't connect to WIFI. As I was not satisfied with the equipment i asked then to take away the handset no one turned up. poor service washing off the hands after after the sale. Will never buy from this source or recommend any one to. When you sell a product stand for that..####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
This phone works well for 15 days then if we watch videos on you tube it goes blank till the sim is removed from its jack & inserted back again. This has become an everyday affair now.

From the next day of purchase phone it’s getting hang seems software problem were there. May be this was used phone they sold me.

The processor is very slow and worst. Within one week of purchase phone started hanging and then the screen went off automatically. I went to the MI store to show them, first they did a complete check and gave me the phone back for use, again it started getting off then I went to store again they checked it and gave it back again phone was showing same problems, now the store people said me that they will repair it's display but again i am facing same issue. My has not been resolved yet. I have been purchasing redmi phones since last 5 years for me and my family members but this is the first time I am having such bad experience, being a loyal customer of redmi i feel very bad for having faced such issue .....####[['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]

Don't go with this mobile.

Replace time period is completed so I cannot replace again so I need repair with my own money. It is very tedious and irritating phone so I don't recommend this phone.

Charging is slow. Battery life is not as expected. Only rear lens position changed. Picture quality is very poor.Don't buy. Some old model with name change. No infrared, no no compass, FM not working. You can't select contacts. One by one you have to delete. Apps are loading slow compared to old model. Go for some other models.

I am posting this review after extensive use of the mobile and I can surely say that this is the one of the best budget 5G mobile which comes with a nice processor and able to handle all day to day task with very smoothly and with ease. But camera quality is the thing which could be improved. However all other things are upto the mark and highly recommend product in this price range. One of the best 5G budget mobile####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
This phone is O. K for me as I am not a heavey gamer or photographer, although i watch a lot of videos on phone. After extensive research, I selected this 5 G phone. First it was cheapest in this range and was providing maximum features. 2nd Dual speakers are really good . 3rd Charger was also with in box, which charges my phone really fast. 4th Camera is also O.K.if you are not shooter. However only drawback is it really sucks in sunlight, screen almost goes black and Unnecessary apps are also annoying. For daily normal usage it is value for money####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
I had purchased this to gift to my SIS for rakhi. She loved the phone. The camera quailty is good but not execllent and it was quick to lock focus. Battery life is good and she told me that the battery lasted for than 2 days without any issues. REDMI NOTE 11T 5G is value for money. If camera performance is the high priority then it will fall short otherwise very good phone is the budget.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I bought this phone for Rs. 15,300/- and the phone is nice but there is little lag in Fingerprint sensor placed at the side of the phone otherwise the phone is good in this price range. The phone gets charged in just 45 to 50 minutes from 15% to 100%. Battery backup is also good it last for around two days if not used extensively. The company should provide atleast one more rear camera in this price range. Mi phones are best i have been using Redmi note 5 pro before this phone and the previous phone i bought on 15th August 2018 and its still working. Good job Mi.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive']]
Earlier I was confused about buying note 10 pro or 11t 5g. No doubt note 10 pro's camera & display quality is better than 11t but it cannot beat 11t's performance and battery. Yeah I also agree 11t's camera quality and display could have been better but still I don't have any issue. They're doing well for me. Its display is quite good and it is not that bad as it is shown in some YT review videos when we're outside. Now when comes to the performance and battery, this phone is a beast man..!! It's so smooth. You cannot complain here. Thank you. Hope this review will help you.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
I like this phone very much it's an amazing device, the functionality, the speed, the ease of opening and transitioning from one app to another and opening multiple apps, the sound etc is really good. Camera is nice but when I zoom it in video mode, the quality drops, it becomes blurr, expected better quality. But overall a good phone.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
The product is a good budget smartphone. Camera Quality is 5- Star. Display and touch Sensitivity, gestures is good. Fingerprint scanner is slow. The transparent cover sent is extremely tight to fit the phone in. The batter backup is quite unexpected. It's low. The battery drains fast even under normal usage.####[['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
Battery life and performance is good and charging with 33 watt is satisfactory. Could have more little more brightness expected in outdoors. Sound is good and watching media content is pleasing with its thin display edges. Ram management is need to improve, even if it having 6 gb ram plus 2 gb virtual ram features it kills most of apps in the background. Camera is average and need software update along with andriod 12. Front camera is good as compare to back. No any heating or lag issue in day to day uses. Call quality is good, loud and clear but lacks premium phone like quality. 5g capable with mediatek 810 . Security update is slower than low budget mi phones as now I received may month patch and it's already July month. Overall good phone but need improvement through update for sure. If you don't want to spend 20k on phone but need powerful and overall good package then you can go for it as all 5g phone under 20 k has lots of compromise but this has very few.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'neutral'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
The camera should be improved the 50MP camera looks like a 12mp photos taken on an entry-level mobile The display is quite descent the viewing angles should be better The design of this phone makes it the best looking smartphone in the segment especially the Stardust White colour is super attractive and eye catchy The battery life is super good all thanks to 6nm processor and 5000mAh battery####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Providing review on product performance before 24 hr not good idea. However I am forced to put product with accessories I have received missing items like screen cleaner and sim ejector. It's mentioned when I buy but in box those are missing. Handset performance seems good will give review after some week useage.

rreview after 8 day redmi note 11t 5g is the best quality phone with no bugs, lags . camera quality is good satisfied photos video quality good , battery also runs 1 and half day if no internet , if use internet than also last for 1 day easily, scream display also perfect . no regret, after taking this phone i am happy, now dont compare with upcoming models it will deffintly hav many new features, also dont compare with previous all packges phones they too have other shortcomings. so i am happy with my redmi note 11t 5G. thankyou for good product.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The first phone I got had damaged speakers. The replacement is good in all aspects. The Speaker is very loud and doesn't crack at high volume. Battery doesn't last full day as advertised, maybe yes, if you keep it idle. Phone is performance based and works smoothly. It doesn't heat up while working, but it does while charging. Front camera is decent but rear camera is despicable. It's not the quality but the contrast level that makes you look ugly by making every crease on your face prominent.####[['platform general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral']]
This mobile phone not as good as it looks. Because it has hanging problems.

The cameras photo quality was not bad but the video quality was so bad it just glicthes sometimes like it make some part very dark and the other parts very bright and the back panel is like made up of toy plastic the back panel is so bad that it felt like you can snap it with your fingers it can break if you tap on it with your fingernail a little hard. It's like giving so many cons for giving 5g at this price####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Good 5g phone. But no way to use external memory support, card. Weight is more. Camera quality is not good like oppo or Vivo. It's good for those who are using phone only for regular calls and messages, or watching videos. Not good for teenagers or youngsters those who spend more time in mobile####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative']]
During incoming calls screen do not unlock and display remain black cant see calls only ringtone plays and when manually unlock the screen call doesnt show. on notification it shows but answering declining do not work. even the volume of mobile is so much poor that cant hear calls with full volume or even songs or any media. this is basic function of mobile but it failed in that. even my replacement had worst issue of UI keep flickering and screen keep switch on and off during any incoming call. see the attached videos####[['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
I thought the camera will be good but very much dissatisfaction, there is a some glitch in the camera as there is shadow in every click and today i found that camera unable scan the scanner of a smartwatch. I gifted the phone to my younger sister and bought it specially for the camera as she likes clicking pictures very much yet she felt bad about it so am i as I couldn’t able to give her that satisfaction with the camera####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]
Phone is slow as compare to it's specs. Major issue is it's calling glitch. Screen becomes black after dialing a number Or receiving a call not able to cut the call. Call ending is on the mercy of other sides person. Or wait till it automatically cuts. Happening on daily basis or any time.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
Desent phone overall.Battery life is good,charges in less time. Just a few cons- Bad camera quality pictures break into pixels,the brightness is very low even when you raise it to full brightness level, cannot insert sd card if you have 2 sims(only 2 slots,1 for sim,other for sim/sd card,only 1 can be inserted).There is no bling light like in previous models( the small led blinking continuously when the screen is asleep for notifications), you don't know if u have any notifications till u wake the screen.Also the fingerprint sensor sometimes will not unlock the phone (very rare,but happens), so u have to type in the password.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
I dont know why redmi nowadays degrading the quality. I really miss an era when I loved to use redmi phones. Camera quality is totally waste. While on video call, other person can't see me camera captures black video.

Camera quality is not meet the expectations but gives ok ok performance. It's battery is not good after using 1 hours or half an hour continuosly it's temprature is going high even you use lightily but battery backup is good. Some time it's hang and create problems to operate some apps smoothly. So there is many problems occure in this phone so try to avoide this phone and but another one.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
The performance of this mobile is not what Mi used to provide in previous phones. Dual speaker is of no use! The speaker on the top of the phone is barely audible. There is no notification or charging LED. The notifications will only pop up after few seconds after you will unlock the phone and use it. The camera is optimised for close-up photos. The Macro camera is missing!

First of all, it's starting laging after the return window period over, now I have to take this to redimi service centre, reason being, while calling screen goes blank, and it took longer time to load the app, have checked every software update in the phone. Overall bad experience.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
It's been more than a month since I have been using this phone... And i am not at all happy. The worst part in this is the camera quality which is really bad. The pictures come blurred or the colour of the object is altered. Even the phone speaker isn't loud enough if u want to watch a movie or listen to music. Other things like battery and display are good. But i regret buying this phone.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
The product quality was quite disappointing. Basic features like sound quality of incoming voice calls is very poor and unclear as well as camera quality is not upto the mark.

Never except that REDMI product is become so bad that is comparable with under 6k budget phones...the camera is worst for 19k I bought this phone and it's utterly waste of money I could bought some other brand phone with good cam clarity and the battery sucks like hell I received a faulty product and the launcher crashes suddenly in the mid of users usage which the basic necessity that a person bought higher GB RAM phone for multitasking and this phone is not doing it at all####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative']]
Battery is good, fast charging is good, camera is decent quality. The biggest issue I face with this mobile is whenever i use google maps navigation it starts showing "searching for GPS". I have been to redimi service, they just rest the phone and gave it back to me. No use, issue is still the same. I did try various other options shown in youtube, but no use. Its very irritating, every time GPS don't work.

I am writing this review after 6 month of use, earlier i was using Redmi 6 pro and that phone was superb but this phone hang and even you don't have control in it, it open all the app in your phone and do some thing and it doesn't allow to switch off as well and it goes till 5 to 10 min, some time I scared it won't blast..it's wrost phone from MI..i have factory reset the mobile but still it have issue####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Just after 6 months of usage. The phone hangs, it's slow after switching to 90htz refresh. It's really cumbersome to use, if you wish to do multi-tasking. If you are calling and want to check some mail Or gallary it goes in sleepmode and just cannot make it active but you can simply continue your call. While calling it will open some other app due to sensitive touch then it's a nightmare to come back on calling screen in case you wish to use ivr menu. Camera is pathetic. Sound is pathetic, even my le2 was better. Contacts app is useless cannot be managed. Overall the phone is a cheat and deserves 0 star####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
Everything was amazing. Battery life on this phone is excellent , It's a 6000mAh Battery with Fast Charging with 10W charger and BIG display.

I like it very budget phone performance is very good over all a very good phone.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Itel P40 In this reasonable price best phone, Looks are amazing and features are awesome with 4GB Ram ( 2GB +2*GB with fusion memory ) and 64 Rom and also with.

This Mobile Phone is very very attractive & fabulous Look in low price. This phone has very good features and working is very smooth. Camera performance is very good. Battery life is too good & impressive for a compact device and the phone easily manage two days of use on a single charge.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Not bad has a great battery life looks are pretty cool works just like normal smartphone however it works a bit slow and have some technical difficulties in some process. But at this price range not so bad can use it as an extra phone for rough use without being worried.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Please don't fall for this fraud within one day it turned out to be a defective product. With regard to Amazon they have been friendly with me but all this is very time consuming. Amazon is now going to send a technician for checking whether my accusation regarding the product is true lol then only they will initiate the refund. Give two more thousands and get a branded phone from Samsung. This isn't my first bad experience with Itel I had bought a type phone for my dad two years back that also turned out to be faulty.####[['platform general', 'negative'], ['platform prices', 'negative']]
I am writing this review after using Tecno spark 8T for more than 5 months. Phone performance is good in this segment. This mobile provide dual sim of 4g VOLTE connectivity. You can use both sim for 4g volte connection. I like most the seamlessly data network switching function at your need by single tap. Videos runs without flicker and screen quality is good. Little draw back is it's speaker. Doesn't have dolby sound and speaker sound is also not as per expectation. 50mp Camera quality is good and provide good picture qualities.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative']]
Finger print reader is very slow. But face unlock is superfast. Sometimes the face unlock not works due to security issues. If u have some skills in photography you could have great photographs. I feel the lack of image stabilisation. Night shooting is not so good. But fully satisfied with battery. Its better than any high priced branded phones.####[['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
I am an average phone user and this phone works fine for me and I highly satisfied with its specification and performance.

OVERALL The phone is good, i bought it for my Mummy, she is love playing games and scroll youtube in free time and she needs a good battery with smooth user interface for this purpose I bought this and it's completely fulfilled GOOD BATTERY AND EASY UI but there only thing is fingerprint sensor it's not that much accurate need so many attempt to get it right. Over all she loved the mobile and yes so many inbuilt app are there I just turned all the notification off and disabled the background activities they are annoying.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'neutral'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
The quality of the phone is excellent.

Never buy these tecno smartphones, because in all these tecno phones there is full of bloatware which can be very problematic, in my case it fails to connect to my projector mirrorcast because in the phone root it is programmed only to connect with tv mirrorcast not with other mirrorcast there is lag while watching movies playing games even simple one like subway surfer, very bad ram management, reason is pre installed bloatware wich is the part of phone os neither u can disable nor u can uninstall, one good thing is fhd+display. And battery is normal under normal usage####[['company general', 'negative'], ['os usability', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]

I'm writing this review for the sole purpose of giving my vote that Tecno has outdone themselves with this product. All of your basic fears are unneeded. It's a solid fold phone that you don't need to worry about, from it's build quality, to it's performance, it's definitely worth the investment.####[['company general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Here Is Beyond Extraordinary Smartphone *Phantom V Fold* I have Never Seen Such A Extraordinary & Brilliantly Made Smartphone That has Made By TECNO, Superbly amazing It's 7.85 2K LTPO Display, Which Leads Me to Enjoy Theatre Like Experience, For Me Dimensity 9000+ 4NM Processor Allows me to do hassle free Gaming & Smooth Functioning####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive']]
Outstanding phone from Techno. See the photographs. Enlarge it. It will not fade out rather the real photograph will come out. I have compared it with Vivo X90. In photographs facing bright light the picture of Vivo loses the skin tone, if you enlarge. This phone is really gorgeous. I am really fortunate that I choosed it not iPhone 14 plus at this price. This phone is really gorgeous in hand. I am using it throughout the day seeing You Tube but could not finish the Battery. Remember, the Always on Display is Video not photo. A great feel in hand. The fold will not automatically open even if you hang it with one leaf of it. Really great in aesthetics too. If one can afford, this is indeed a great phone to buy. Techno had really came out as a brand. It's great. An extraordinary phone. You can take selfies with flashlight on with the Rear Camera.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive']]
Amezing folding phone. Quality product. Solid hardware. Wow Camera, Superb battery performance with great processor. The phone's folding mechanism is a game-changer, making it incredibly convenient to carry around. I highly recommend the Phantom v fold phone to anyone####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
I didn't want to spend 1.5 Lakhs on the new fold 4, so bought the Phantom V Fold after hearing great feedback from the YouTube community. This phone is a massive upgrade to the Samsung Fold 3 which I was previously using. The camera is superb, touch is way better than Samsung, the interface is very good, bigger screen. Over all it feels great to hold the phone. Also the back cover free with the phone makes it very easy to hold it when fully open. This is my best phone buy till date. If you want a fold phone, this is a steal away price.####[['display design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Very excited to be a user of phantom V Fold.. Just I can say amazing phone and value for money .. Everything is just superb.. Why people will pay 1.5 lac when it is under 90k and it's beyond the extraordinary really as it's tagline mentioned while unboxing####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
This is an amazing phone. Once my son had taken our scooter with him. Not knowing what to do, I said, "Hello Google. Take me to office." Suprisingly the phone asked me to open it and sit on the screen. When I did so, it transported me within seconds to my office. This phone has the ability to solve all the problems of India!! According to me the price of this phone should atleast be 10 lakhs.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Man o man, this is my first fold and also my first phone above 30k. Was very skeptical to buy it and even cancelled once then bought it finally. I should tell you that this phone is a beast when it comes to performance, features, security, the fold experience. It has everything one would ask for in a fold and some more. It has the perfect aspect ratio for both screens, has the largest battery life and the UI and tecno has so much more to offer. Within 7 days of purchase got 2 system updates and improvements. The camera is not the most perfect but I am nt a camera guy so didnt bother me. Overall very happy with the purchase and worth the price. If you are wanting to experience fold, go for it !!####[['phone general', 'conflict'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Phone is full of spec but there is lots of bugs in softwares need to improve and doesn't unlocked 90 fps in pubg mobile even this processor does support high-end graphics almost 1 week with this phone, no other issues i face , if there is anything happens in future i will update my review####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative']]
If phantom will be able to reconstruct it's software properly this phone is marvelous. There is sometimes network issue, heating problem this can be fix by software update. Overall first time fold phone user will not get any problem that is for sure. Problem discussed are minor. Display is similllar to Samsung. Recommonded phone####[['software general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I see too many 5 star reviews for this phone. I also saw lot of videos on you tube and all spoke highly about the phone and I decided to buy the phone. Else than a gold phone there is nothing else you will get for this cost. The phone is so heavy that you need both hands to operate which is very frustrating when you are on the move or is busy with something and just want to check the phone. Attending calls on speaker is a nightmare, volume is too low and hard to communicate on speaker mode. Battery is a disaster, I charged the phone to 100 percent and by afternoon 1 pm, battery is just 35 percent left and I didn't even use the fold open mode much, I didn't watch any video etc. I didn't play any game. Overall just a gold phone. Not for people looking for an easy going life with the phone.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
Bad Bad Bad i encountered this problem with tecno display both on outer and inner displays, I bought this phone for my mother since she always liked bigger displays but foldables were out of my budget for so long kudos to tclecno team for making this possible device is absolute beauty outside and a beast inside not only looks the device ui and features are also great best device to watch old 4:3 ration films my mom liked device very much as I already stated camera is decent not bad. But gaming & content watching experience is awesome. And kickstand is an added bonus.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
It's a perfect mobile at this price I bought it for my daughter and she liked it a lot earlier she was asking to buy MI or Samsung but when I showed this option she agreed non willingly but when she had the mobile in hand and operated 2 3 days she amazed with the performance , this is simply great mobile at this price####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
This is the best one for gaming,best phone under 12000. But the camera filter is not so good,but also I'm happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi, gta, critical strike and many games at a time,and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay. This phone is not for reel'stars or photography. But u will get 90 hz display it is so sooth then other.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive']]
Its really a good find for me TECNO POVA 4 in 12k budget. After a complete 4 day use I must say that this a phone which I was looking for months. Its big memory 13GB & 128GB storage keeps all my things intact. I played a few heavy games & I am quite satisfied with the performance Even selfies & back camera are a real good one & gives professional pictures. A massive 6000 mAh battery is super for an all-day use !!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k. I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios. if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios. hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look. And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support. Now I am not happy with this device. Wish i had gone with poco, the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues. And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates. Plus you got to stick with booring hios.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['memory design_features', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'conflict']]
If you are taking it for gaming then look at another phone because everything is good in this phone but the display is not right.This display is not as smooth as I expected If Techno had given this phone with a good display of then this phone would have been the best phone in the budget.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
Worst ,sorry to say but it's true.i bought this mobile like few weeks ago and after that mobile hang started I try to return but window close so unfortunately still it is with me in my drawer..I rarely believe on emerging brand but from now,no to this type of company. First and last mistake..plz don't buy this Mobile.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
I bought this for 11999 in Amazon I worked for 3 days with this mobile it is HANGING frequently and slowing sometimes not working, I restart the mobile every 2 hours and working sometimes after 5 minutes it's hanging and not working. I placed returned but there is no option for replace the product, the inspection officer will come to inspect the device I HAVE LOSSED MY MONEY####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Finally got 5G supporting worth smartphone at this price which do supports both Airtel and Jio 5G with 13 Bands compared to other who either support one and doesn't support other one! Also Battery capacity doesn't disappoints but makes phone bit bulky. It's made for those who prefer other activities over game. Binge watching plus IPL is an great experience with this device.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
First of all I used this device for business purposes, Battery is best part of it almost 3 days still 8% remaining, I use whatsapp, youtube, Google Chrome, calls and sometimes camera. All this work like a charm. Look and Display are very nice, Display is big enough for your daily work and to keep in your pocket. camera is batter then other Chinese variants, it has gorilla Glass protection and no IP protection means you need to protect it from water splash. Battery In whole night only use 2%, no bloatware, clean os, not any false battery draining. I used Jio 5G works like butter in Mumbai. Used this phone for 7 days there is no lag I found in any software, software opening is fast. Overall it's best phone for day to day life work and business purposes. I have 6 GB variant. Again thanks to samsung for providing this marvel for such a budget cost. Amazon delivery is fast delivered on second Day.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive'], ['company price', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
Good phone in its category in budget segment. Special highlight is it's monster battery+Above average camera and ok type performance. This phone is not for a gamer/photographer because it can provide you everything in its limit. Never compare it with Galaxy S23 Ultra or iPhone 14 like performance and feature. It is just like comparing Alto with BMW or Ferrari. Where Alto is best known for its mileage this phone is best for its battery endurance.  I have bought this for my father and very happy to say that it suites for him for his daily needs.

Ordered it for my Dad. Samsung never disappoints. Decent screen and camera quality. Performance wise its so good, did not face any issue till now. Seen other bad reviews, probably they are using it with other unwanted apps, bloatwares and expecting very high end gaming performance. Even I bought only 4GB RAM version and it works like a charm without any hiccups, 4G carrier aggregation, 5G reception and speed everything works fine. Only CON was I had to purchase 25W adapter separately which adds additional cost because of only which giving 4 star rating otherwise would have given 5 .####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['company general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
A really good phone at this price range good for daily usage i don't do gaming much so processor is not a issue for me .It has good screen good camera handle day today stuff with easy big battery Only downside is it doesn't come with a charge.One star less for this Overall good product go for it better than unreliable Chinese mobile####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
I purchased this phone on the day it was launched and I found defects on the display and the phone was defective. Defective because the portion below the sim slot on the left hand side made clicking sound when pressed which means the case is little bigger than the phone. I returned the phone and the new phone also came with the same defect but now on the right hand side below the fingerprint sensor. I m returning it again. Only good thing is the battery but if it comes with a defect then what's the point? Also when you are spending 1000 more for the charger. Highly disappointed.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Poor performance, bad built quality, bulky and heavy in this segment. Specifications of camera is good but it doesn't deliver quantity pics. Low performance of camera is super super bad. Issues are also there with normal network connectivity. Many times tower will go off whereas in other phones it will be there. I purchased at 13.5K but even if you get at 9K, it's a bad deal..####[['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
It's an utter disgrace that it comes with no charger and fast charging is not compatible with other brand chargers. Apart from that, it just randomly switches to 4g from 5g with no option to revert back to 5g. It depends on the phone's mood to let you use 5g or not, defeating the complete purpose buying a 5g device. Utterly useless piece of trash. Do not buy. Better go for a snapdragon processor phone that comes with a charger.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
I'm facing heating issues from day one of purchase. I haven't installed any game till now but still facing heavy heating issues with just 15mins of continuous use. Screen gets freeze often. Camera is good but again if you use the phone for 10mins you'll see the phone heats like an iron box. Not recommended####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I can't put the photos of the product because I am currently using it so I can't click its photo from its on camera what I am telling you about performance it's a nice phone in a budget range with 4GB of physical Ram and 3GB of fusion Ram so total RAM is 7gb and 64GB of storage fast charging daily work nice its charge my mobile within 1 hour to 1.5 hours camera is decent performance is awesome there are no issues in this mobile it's price is less but its feels very premium i like it I love it and I recommended to the people but if you are a gamer it's not for you but if you wanted phone with a decent budget range with a better performance camera and battery then this is for you go ahead without any doubts or hesitation####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
I like the specifications of the phone which are mid-range specifications of under rs20,000... the battery is so huge can easily operate whole day once charged full, the fingerprint and face lock are really fast ,like mid-range smartphone, camara is perfect for under 10,000 , also one thing I like it it has Bokeh mode in videography.. But one thing is bad for this phone, which is gyro, this phone doesn't had a gyroscope.... .. Last but not the least it has supper smooth experience when I open any app, the app opens with animation with smooth experience.. That's it for my side ... . Phone is best for low range with specifications of Mid-range smartphone ... Under rs10,000 Best phone####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Recommended for everyone whose budget is under 10K. Budgetwise camera and mobile is out of the world. Amazing. Bought it at 9K. Provides more features than other phones in this range. Camera quality is superb. More than expected I would say. Recommended to everyone if their budget is below 10K. Bloatwares can be easily uninstalled. Designwise and performancewise perfect phone for 9K price tag. Has many features like SOCIAL TURBO mode, which enhances the WhatsApp usage experience. It also has smart charging protection for the battery i.e. it stops charging when the battery is fully charged.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive']]
In this price, it is the best deal. Camera quality is very good, video quality very good. Very advance features. Battery charging time: 1 hour. Battery back up good. Front light and beauty Plus option while video calling. UI is good and easy. Overall it is worth buying. Problems: when I close the tabs, touch screen works poorly, otherwise touch screen is fine. I prefer closing all tabs at the same time then. Second: low audio sound due to one speaker, no Dolby Atoms.####[['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
Honestly speaking I was looking for a phone which contains a good battery, fast charging, 4gb ram and super performance with a good display quality. And this phone literally fulfilled each and every aspects except camera, and it was never my concern. But in this price range I can assure you it has more than average camera. So if you are looking for a phone under 10000 , you should go for it. It is the best option for sure.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Used phone for week. This phone is very good at this price range, good BIG display. The battery backup is very good, Charge within hour.

Small small terms are in this mobile are so irritating. In this smartphone I get google dialer and google massage which is so irritating when I am recording any call the dialer speak aloud that your call is recording and when I am finding call recording, I didn't get that neither in file manager nor in contact history. Camera quality is fair & battery life is excellent. One more bad thing is in this smartphone Callander has no option to set Indian holiday.

Not good not bad. As per price its a good product. Not good for gaming. Display is weak need to care more. Unnecessary apps is a big disadvantage. Camera is good according to price.

Since it was a very new brand in the market so I thought of giving it a try. So disappointed with the product. In terms of hardware the mobile is still fine except that oversized screen but in terms of software Tecno needs to work a lot. There are many issues with the software means in terms of features.

I am totally unhappy with this product. All specifications would be good but this product is not good. You must do not buying this. I had been puchesed a new phone I found a big mistake it's charging point is not working.And Amazon's return and replacement policy is very bad. If you want a longer performance mobile then do not purchase it..####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
The Oppo A15s is a pretty affordable smartphone for use .My budget was for a minimum range smartphone .My friend and college friend recommended me to go for the Opp0 A15s .The Oppo A15s is powered by a mediated Helion p35 processor .The camera are something that I think really does their job well. The picture I have most and color is very good. The 13 megapixel back camera's is a docent one and plus the selfie camera in the front .My recommended is a very good for purchase.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
For reader who would to buy smartphone OPPO A15s is just a okay phone but not value for money, it could be more better cause most of the people who have trusted OPPO for there quality, battery backups & camera purpose. After using it I would like to say my honest opinions is that it has some issues like battery support for fast charging problem, Camera quality very low not well to satisfy user, some reboot issue and there other fault like in camera and videos taking.####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['company quality', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
i am reviewing after using 90 days of this product. Actually I am buying this phone for online classes. 2-3 disadvantages in this phone, 1. Battery draining fast. 2. I can not open 2-3 window at a time due to hanging issue. 3. Touch is not working now a days. if your use is simple then go for it because price is good. but if you work more on mobile then go for other oppo phone.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I bought this for my dad first. As he doesn't need the camera, we didn't check it first. But later we switched my phone with his new one. It's just now I checked the camera quality and works at its worst!! Can't zoom, the colors look entirely different from the real view. I got completely messed up when went to dress shopping and wanted to get suggestions from someone over the phone. I had to take pictures to know the structure and used voice clips to explain the colors!! Don't even think about buying this if you'll ever have to take a pic. I'm regretting buying this as the return time is over.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
This Phone works perfectly fine when you are in India. Once you travel outside india, neither your india sim which is in roaming works nor local country sim. No issues with the phone but this has to be clearly called out some where so that people will not by Network Locked phone.

All features are good except the camera Quality... 8GB+3GB Expandable RAM That too for this price... Is really very Good one... But Mentioned as 50Mp Camera but doesn't seems to be like that. Very Very Worst Camera Quality Ever... (Even 8Mp camera is better than this Camera) Very Much disappointed for that.  Yet to check the Battery life and other features  Update: Battery Life is also very Good. Apart from Camera every other features are good as mentioned####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Reviewing after using it for 2 months. After mild usage of 1 month, the phone starts hanging. WIFI driver has issues, battery back-up does not last for more than 17 hours. That mentioned 8gb is just crap. My 4gb Samsung phone is faster than this 8gb. Phone too slow. Opening applications like snapchat and payment applications takes long time####[['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
Very nice smartphone,camera and sound are awesome,display is very nice and the texture on the phone's back side is pretty good because it does not catch fingerprint smudges. Thanks to Amazon for quick and fast delivery and the delivery experience was very good.

As always, Nokia has yet again amazed us with a new powerful budget smartphone! There’s nothing to not love about this device - the large HD+ screen (though FHD could have been provided at this price range) with 90Hz refresh rate; fast, responsive Fingerprint Sensor; the camera is so much better with AI imaging! And as always, Stock Android and Nokia’s Optimised Performance combined offer a long battery life of at-least 2 days! The back panel has a textured finish, I personally love the design! The device came with pre-applied Screen Protector, but you’d want to get a new edge-to-edge screen protector applied as the one that it came with wouldn’t withstand scratches or falls from heights. All in all, definitely a smart buy!####[['company price', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]

The phone offers stock Android and 2 guaranteed Android updates which makes it a good choice in the price segment.  Battery backup lasts you well over a day on average usage and fast charging could have been better but the intended user group won't complain about it at the price.  Face unlock is really good. Camera is average and memory management is better than most MI or Samsung offerings in similar price range.####[['software general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['memory general', 'positive']]
The mobile is working nice and battery backup is good. I like the battery backup and touch screen. The cell is so nice and look wise it's great. But it's best mobile at this price. The drawback of the mobile is camera clarity and screen resolution. Eventjough its mentioned that it has 50MP resolution, it does give pictures of that quality.  But after using for 2 weeks i realised that the phone hangs atleast Once in 30 min. Poor performance. Some options won't work for some time . Very bad experience i have now.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
I recently purchased the Nokia G11 Plus mobile phone, and unfortunately, my experience with this phone has not been great. It has some significant issues that make it difficult to use. One of the most frustrating issues with this phone is that it hangs too much, making it hard to complete even simple tasks. Additionally, the phone has a tendency to switch off randomly, which can be quite inconvenient, especially when I'm in the middle of something important.  The battery life on this phone is also a major concern. The battery drains very rapidly, even when the phone is not in use, which means that I have to charge it frequently throughout the day.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Compass, Google Maps do not work properly without magnetometer. This should prove that Indian made electronics are made by cheats. I have a cheaper phone realme made in china which has magnetometer.

I brought this phone primarily hoping that it would have a long battery life and I would be able to just use it to send and receive phone calls. I kept the apps to a minimum to keep the battery working long. The battery is good and it last me a day and a half after one full charge but that all the good I can say about this phone. The speaker on this phone is terrible and most of the time people on the other side have to repeat what they want to say a couple of times. The cell reception is terrible. Overall do not buy this####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I am nokia fan and I had used nokia lumia phone back then. So waited long time to buy nokia phone and it's g21. All I can say is, it's one and only Android that last charging more than 2 days. It's been 4 months and I always Don't have to worry about my phone charge. Phone performance is super good and camera quality is at its highest level.  It has good amount of storage that let you to install as many apps and data.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I purposely chose Nokia over other brands in this value segment because it is a brand that I innately trust. Also, it isn't just emotions at work here, this is a device that runs on stock android, has a good screen size, is light and not bulky, and comes at a price that doesn't hurt the wallet. Personally, I'm a OnePlus 7Pro user. However, should that ever get damaged or stolen and I should need a back-up phone for long-term usage as a follower of minimalism, I'll opt for this in a heartbeat. The delivery occurred on time, the price was good courtesy the Amazon cashback offers, and the phone makes the person who received it as a gift happy, so all in all, a good purchase!####[['company general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive'], ['platform prices', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I've bought Nokia G21 after using Nokia 8.1 for three years. The previous experiences of Nokia has always been pleasant. With Nokia G21, my experience has only been elevated. At the outset, the feel of the phone is fabulous. The added new features of Android 12 gives a smooth experiences, coupled with a power pack battery life. Regular security updates and OS upgradation surely makes Nokia G21, a class apart with other competitors in the market. The AI 50 MP camera gives a superb quality to the photographs. The build quality is smooth and gives a premium feel and look. The phone is fully featured loaded just as it is expected. The best part of Nokia has always been a bloat free apps in the phone. Overall a very nice phone. I'll surely recommend others to buy Nokia G21 phone until 5G network is fully established and rolled out pan-India.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]
I am impressed by the Nokia series of phones; I got this one for my dad and so far he has been extremely satisfied with the phone. The device feels and looks sturdy and despite the low price compared to other brands, it is pretty responsive and does not display any lag. Plus, the absence of any manufacturer's own bloatware makes it a very "light" phone to use, and not confusing the elders like him. I am not very gung ho about its camera though, and hence I have not gone ahead and given 5 stars. And its not like my dad is into professional photography so not an issue at all. In a nutshell, I am impressed by the Nokia series, given the features and its price point and I have gone ahead and got the C21 Plus for my teenager two days back. I am definitely recommending it for users looking for a budget friendly mobile device.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Bought this phone for the clean android and guaranteed updates. It’s been 3months now and it’s working just perfect. It does what I need it to do. Calls texts emails web browsing and social media. Watching videos on the big screen is a nice experience. The battery life is amazing and that makes this phone special. Have got two security updates in three months already. Looking forward to a long innings with this beauty.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
I presented this phone to my Father in-law and mother in-law recently. They were never familiar with Android phone and had been using the old nokia handsets forever. Initially they were a bit hesitant to use it but as we started teaching them, they found the simplicity of this model and were soon excited to use them! It's been a week since they have been using the Nokia G21 and they're really happy with it. The audio quality of the phone is excellent. They are super excited about the camera since they never clicked photos of their own. My father in-law watches cricket on YouTube and the wide screen of the phone does justice to his cricket cravings. The UI of the phone is user friendly, security measures are on power and the 50MP camera helps my mom in-law take amazing photos of her beautiful garden! Over all it's been a great purchase!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive']]
Fingerprint reader is snappy, battery life is huge - can last upto 3 days without charging if used for basic purpose like calling and wifi on full time, and moderate internet usage and apps, calls, etc. Camera quality is okay in this range considering price. Body looks good. Performance is also good, at the beginning it was snappy, but now a little less reponsive after about 15 days of usage - still good. Android version is 11, not sure if there is gonna be 12 or 13, though. Overall a good budget phone buy - especially if you want a long lasting battery####[['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Experience of 70 days. During delete, select all menu , in the App of contacts , sms, is not given, its a problem. During night, only 5% battery drains , Camara quality is not like Samsung 50 mp. Zooming creates blurring. Battery performance is the best during use but non use drais 100% in 36 hours. 120 m takes to charge 100%. Touch is like Samsung. Numbers of Calculator is too Big. Front camera n Speaker are the best. Price is affordable. Automatic battery saver mode is given. At all Nokia is brand . Out look of mobile is the best####[['software general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Phone is ok for general usage, but my struggles with Nokia continue. The place where I live has no proper mobile reception, I'm heavily dependent on Vo Wifi calling. i had absolutely no issues with my previous Samsung phone, but Nokia G21 frequently disconnects in the middle of a call. I tried reaching out to customer service but was not helpful. Advertisements are promising but I don't find it living up to it . Camera is not great either. Promise of 2year updates is another disappointment. There is Android 13 available and my G21 still runs on Android 11. At this rate, they can promise 4 years of updates also but it does not help customers.  I always knew Nokia is bit expensive at this range compared to others. Only because my affinity towards Nokia I still bought this one, though I didn't have a great experience with Nokia 6 either. Nokia has got the advertisements right, but it is high time they start delivering those promises####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['company price', 'negative']]
Overall experience is better, no lagging, best usage in office use and general purposes, I would suggest though, go with the 6gb RAM and 128gb Internal Storage expandable memory upto 512gb varient. camera quality is decent but the most noticeable is the battery backup which is phenomenal. But there is a reason to giving it 3 stars. Whenever you buy, there will be a sticker attach to the package saying that you have to give 5 stars and write a great review in amazon and take a screen shot and post it to Nokia's official site to get Brand new Nokia Earphones(Which is a gimmick). It is a total mar letting strategy. And I would like to add that it's speaker sound is not going to be satisfying. So buy with caution and checking your requirements.####[['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
product packing was bad, it looked as though I got an already opened product, the fingerprint reader is not reading all the time, I have to depend on face unlock, and battery life is down in a day and half and does not stay for 2 even with only calls and WhatsApp usage with 60 Hz screen rate instead of higher. sometimes browser hangs. The phone looks good and feels sturdy for the price, I use only the charger shipped with the box, and the phone charges in about 2 hours or a little over.####[['platform general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Though the mobile offers 3 day backup, I would say that it gives me only 2 day backup. I would like to add that I use this phone only for basic purposes like texting, calling etc and not into any kind of gaming. I am waiting to find out how long this phone(hardware and software) will last. The fingerprint sensor and camera is just average.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'neutral']]
After using it for almost a month , did not find it upto mark On multitasking the phone hangs everytime on the app you are working on , not at all satisfied This was not expected atleast from Nokia , I never used Nokia before so decided to use it but it dissappointed me extremely , no way to recommend this brand to anyone. Pictures are average from the 50MP AI , the selfies are also okay.

I have been using Nokia 3 for the past 4 and a half years. I wished to upgrade it as the software was old and my phone hardware began to show issues too. Chose Nokia g21 as it was a budget phone. Camera and other superb performances were not important for me. But it disappointed me as the phone fails to connect to the saved wifi networks automatically. I tried out all the possible solutions shown in the youtube videos available (restarting phone, resetting network settings, re-saving wifi and even static ip was given) but everything failed. My old phone was a good and dear companion for me but this one is literally a pain!!!####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
The phone's battery is experiencing excessive heat, which is concerning. I had Nokia mobile phones long back. I used to always trust this brand. But in the middle as it was not having Android phone, So for last couple of years, I have used either Iphone or Samsung. However, upon discovering that Nokia now offers Android phones, I decided to purchase it. I stay in USA and bought it for my Father in India from Amazon. I was thrilled to be able to gift him a brand that we both had faith in. Unfortunately, the phone has not lived up to our expectations. It lacks the durability and reliability that we associated with the Nokia brand, which I had even boasted about in stories of my old Nokia phone still functioning today. The battery overheating issue has rendered the phone unusable, causing me to lose faith in the brand that I had once trusted so deeply. It is a total loss buying this. It is disheartening to have paid the price for my past trust in Nokia without realizing that this new Nokia not the same.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Please do not buy this phone. This phone got blasted while it was on charging.

Battery drains fastest ever you would have experienced in your phones used. Phone hangs on normal single app usage or calls. Amazon does not help in replacements or warranty. You are on ur own.

I had the worst experience with this phone! I use my phone for online counseling sessions, and this phone has a terrible echo problem when put on speaker, and the person on the other end can't even have a proper conversation because they can constantly hear their own voice! I got a replacement handset but still had the same problem. I tried to get technicians to visit, but none of them did! The camera was good, and so was the battery life, but the user interface is weird and very confusing. Also, the OS kept asking me to reformat my memory card so I kept losing all my data!! Not sure why this phone is getting such high reviews. I believe it's probably because the phone box says you'll get a free set of earphones if you write a good review! Eventually, I tried to return it and that too was a horrendous ordeal because I didn't get the refund despite giving the phone back, for over two weeks after multiple follow ups! Please don't buy phones online!

This phone is just awesome for this budget. Not for fans of high end mobiles nor for high setting gamers. Its not cheap plastic as mentioned on youtube by some youtubers. This is a budget phone with very good specification and in reality as well. I am a moderate user and this phone fulfils all my needs. Its truely an allrounder and lets not compare it with higher budget phones.Display is quite good and soothing but not too bright and punchi as its just hd, but it does not look like. Its preety up and down compared to its competators and then its you to decide and your trust on the brand. It looks fabulous and especially the lunar red one and is in no way inferior. Much premium in hand feeling and quite light in weight. Its preety flat at the back. I think xiomi has done a great job on this phone and at this budget. Perfect phone for medium users. I definately recommened this phone. Only the changing wire shd have been a little longer.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'neutral'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
This phone falls under beginner level smart phone. This handset is very much suitable for average users who spend time on YouTube and whatsapp or you can say moderate user. If u expect good gaming experience this phone is big NO. Battery performance is very impressive. Display is very nice indoors bit in outdoor u need to switch to 100% brightness level. Camera is decent in that price range. Finger print scanner is fast enough. Without cover handset is slippery. Provided cover barely gives any protection to it's camera lens. Need to buy a good cover which can protect its camera. Not a hybrid slot so that's a plus point. Good networ reception. Both the SIM 4G supported.####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'neutral'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive']]
Nothing which i didnt like in this phone at this peice point. Battery Backup is good. Colour combination is also good especially Lunar red. back Panel Is Of Plastic, which i think is good ,As because It will Not Discolour over a period of time. And due to which at the time of resale Value of device would be decent. Face unlock best. Display quality Good Camera is Really very nice at this price point Both rear and Front camera.

After 1 month usage of 2gb ram variant i got no issues becoz i installed very few apps and maintained 1 GB ram free everytime even after installing apps.I only installed 15 apps. The camera quality felt better than my redmi note 5 pro becoz it has AI camera where rn5 not have that so it takes very sharp and over saturated images...The battery life of both devices same..Finger print sensor is somewhat slow but it's okay..Overall product is good at its price don't miss it if u are are not heavy user ..The display is big and enough to watch movies in 720p####[['memory general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive']]

The screen is good, touch is good, camera are decent. What disappoints me is the sound quality, it is very low volume here and the back cover is very thin. This mobile would be good for some one who uses it for casual web browsing, facebooking, music playing.

I am using this phone from more than 10 days. I will give 4 out of 5 starts to this product. Design is good, sound is good. processor is enough for faster internet. All in a good package phone under 9k. But somehow i am getting problem with its display. What is happening that after use of more than 30 minutes my eyes getting tired and itchy. I cant stare to phone there after. I have other smart phone also and i used to see videos for hours. Working on laptop but never experienced before. I tried to replace but amazon refused by saying that is not a valid reason without giving any technical assistance. Please give my feedback to them and assist me as a good vendor.

Phone is lagging . Camera lagging. During pubg server didn't connect error for many times .so you can't play pubg in it . There is no eis in it hence it is not suitable for videography . Battery is huge & easily provide a backup for atleast 2 days (standard usage) . Battery takes atleast 2.30 hour to charge fully .This device doesn't support fast charging . Conclusion : 2GB ram is not enough for smooth experience. Though camera is lagging but the camera output is outstanding specially when we consider the price. In the price of ₹5400 it's a best option .####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive']]

I am not happy with the cable lenth. Cable length should be more. After using 1 month ,instead of 632 snapdragon processor i am facing little bit lagging while typing overall is better. Camera is good. U can charge phone in 2 hours. And those who r saying the display quality is bad the camera is not good they should buy apple phone. I have compared redmi 7 camera with realme and the camera of realme was worst. In 8000 rupees this phone is good compared to other brand. No heating, camera is good at this price. Those who r criticising they should buy phone of 12000 not 8000.

Worst phone ever, don't buy it. Miui is ridiculous lol. Lags like hell after 6 months of buying. Its the most laggy phone I've ever used. Making a phone call even is difficult with this phone, I mean, come on! With 2gigs of ram this phone barely passes the mark. Avoid buying this.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative']]
Camera quality, fingerprint, design, UI, battery life, everything good. The only problem, the biggest and most annoying is hanging. Of the available 2 GB ram, only around 600mb will be available and becoz of that the phone keeps hanging while on call or whatsapp. Lots of bloatware and no way to remove them. After miui 11 update, things seemed better for a while and again back to level 1.####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['memory design_features', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
I like the design,battery backup but I diss appointed with the performance of the base varient 2gb 32gb storage option this variant lags can't manage apps if we are live on insta or open Instagram camera if we have normal internet connection this phone hangs other varients of this phone is too good I can't play free fire on base varient but pubg lite runs smooth it has another issue is heating problem when you are in the place where temp. Is 35-38 degree this phone heats up to 42°c when you outside the home####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['storage general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
Phone looks and build quality is good. Screen resolution is not FHD. Elements and text looks big and zoomed. In a 6 inch+ screen size it does not feel good. More over I think this model has some touch issues. I have to touch harder or multiple times to click an element. Hope Redmi fixes that via software update in future. Camera is average. Photos are good in sufficient lighting condition. Low light photos are not up to the mark. Battery seems ok. With my daily usage I am getting almost 2 days of battery life. Overall I think the phone is overpriced a bit. Best if offered within 8000 (3gb+32gb) range.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
I'm happy with the features of the phone for the price at which it comes. However, I'm very disappointed with the volume of ear piece. When I talk over phone, the other persons voice is not heard loud enough. I have keep asking them to repeat what they have said. This is very annoying as the basic functionality of phone is to make calls, and that itself is not working properly. Amazon is not giving refund. I'm not sure if they are even giving replacement as the executive who came and checked the phone is not acknowledging the problem promptly.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['platform prices', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'conflict']]
The call quality is terrible and the phone is already lagging very badly after 3 months. The user interface is something I personally hate as well. The fingerprint reader is very fast but phone stays in lock screen for sometime due to lag. Battery life is okay But call quality is terrible And it keeps disconnecting by itself from the WiFi and then you have to forget network and re-enter password for it to work again All in all made a very bad choice will be changing my phone soon.####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
1. Good display quality and colour deliverance 2. Battery lasts for a day with average usage . 3. I'm not a gamer so I won't comment on the gaming performance . 4. Works well for browsing and streaming purposes 5. ****The worst part is that it doesn't have image stabilization , which ruins every shot . Furthermore the camera quality is below average**** 6. Speaker and headphones work well .

Phone has good looks and great design. But don't let it fool you. Phone becomes slower as you start using it. Day after day RAM consumption increases and it's still a mystery why. There are hardly 2-3 apps installed still it lags. It is cheap, good looking phone but if you want phone which works with speed 2019 smartphones then I would suggest not to buy this one.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I'm writing this review after 2 months of usage. And I strongly recommend not to go for this phone. I neither play game, nor I have installed unnecessary apps. I just use this phone for calling, whatsapp and YouTube. 1. But the phone lags very very badly. It sometimes hangs too. 2. Touch sensor doesn't work 3 out of 5 times. Even more. 3. Call doesn't get connected even after swiping up. It happens almost each and every time. 4. Battery is also not that much good. 5. Fingerprint sensor also cannot identify your finger every time.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
After the good review i saw in online, i ordered this for my mom. It is not at all worth for the money we spent. Just after 2 months, it is not at all working . Even whatsapp is not working, photos we cannot take it will taken 5 min for each photo, no app will open everything will taken minimum 5 min, even phone lock also will not open. even after we power on it will take some time to show wallpaper then lock again after sometime only we can do anything with the phone. Oh god terrific, just waste of money. No use at all. Please dont buy at all....####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
(1) Very slow (2) No multi tasking, hangs (3) Gets automatically responds even though it was not touched. Hence based on apps, automatically navigates to some places. (4) Heavy office apps like outlook takes forever and by mistake tilted to landscape, takes another half an hour to adjust (5) Chrome just reopens every tab, even switched between other applications. Using payment gateway was not possible (6) Advertisements and notifications everywhere, even in apps like settings and browser (7) too many bloatware, can't even uninstallable.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
The phone is very slow. I had used redmi products earlier and never expected this to be so slow. If possible would like to exchange it with a faster one by paying the difference amount. This phone is not serving my purpose. When an incoming call comes, you will get the number displayed only after 10-15 seconds after it starts to ring. Also keeps hanging very often. Very disappointed !!!####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Mobile is very very slow it seems this is used product or else dummy piece I getting. finger print is working. camera is average.battery life is worst even if I using with wifi also I think this is first and last my mi product.

I've been using it for 3 months now, because my previous phone fell into the sink and stopped working. I'm writing the review from the same phone. It works really well and I don't see any point in buying expensive Android phones. This works well, no issues in speed or sound quality, the camera is decent.

I'm very happy and satisfied with this phone. It looks very beautiful and premium. I just love it. I like it's everything, it's prformance, smoothness, screen, camera, sound. I was looking for a slim and ligh 5G phone and it's more than my expections. Everything is superb. Battery back up is also good as it's 4250 MAH. It's fast recharge with 33wt is very good and I feel it's more than enough for anyone. I find this device, complete in all aspects . It's a superb 5G phone with HDR and 4K recording with 12 bands, it's with NFC too (if u feel NFC feature would be helpful for you now and in future) And dual speakers with dolby sound, what I was seaching badly in a slim light weight phone. Sound is also loud n clear. This is the only n only 5G mobile available in the market with all above features at this price. There is not any other in competition but inspite of that it's perfect. I'm totally happy n satisfied and not find any cons till now since using last week. Highly recommended whose requirements are similar to mine. This is the only phone in this segment. For me it's a wow ! Amazing product at Amazon. Thanks. Superb, awesome phone, highly recommended for those whose requirements are as mine. Its deaserve for full 5####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['platform general', 'positive']]
This peculiar cum dazzling "Xiaomi 11lite NE 5 g" cellphone's all featured really helpfull in my daily life.It works as a friend to me.I like especially it's Dolby dual speaker which is on upper cum back side ( one in right & one in left side) adjusted.These dual Dolby speakers functions like heaven.It really won my heart.Through ear phone it works too melodious.It's Dolby Vision cum Dolby Atmosphere cum HDR 10+ cum Amoled Screen really functions truly.In my suggestion blindly buy this cellphone which is helpful in my daily life.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive']]
I got it for 18k and have no regrets, form factor build and software experience is pretty good.  First couple of days were a mess as I used to get a lot of ads in the mobile itself but after Miui update 13 all the ads gone away. It's like a clean slate as there are no junk apps now.  Display is crip and delight to watch, however in dark background scene you might notice some smudging of black which fine by me.  Best part is on performance it's top notch no lag or jitters at all and the device remains extremely cool I use it for hours while gaming and couldn't notice any warmth...  Battery is little less as compared to others but believe me even a 10 min charge can give you 40% life so you don't feel the need for bigger one. You can easily get screen on time of more than 7 hours on balanced mode and 90hz####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
Hello guys, I am using xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g from 1 week on wards my experience about this mobile in simple words this mobile fantastic to me. Actual I use this mobile browsing, watching YouTube movies, playing games small such as Cand crush, temple run. I suggest the guys who want to purchase this mobile better to use like professional purpose, because it's light weight phone and slim to. It gives better performance. It can also use as daily lifestyle mobile, coming to the battery performance right now for me it's perfect, Because I use this mobile as professional use. But I think if you're the player in the games such as big games like "PUBG". I better suggest you choose bigger battery mobile. Thank you:)####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
This phone from Xiaomi 5G series is a excellent choice in terms of powerful performance. As the name suggests Xiaomi Lite NE 5G is solid in terms of design and features. The 64MP camera quality is simply stunning and exceptional.  The slimmest phone does the grand work when it comes to producing Dolby vision out of videos. The pictures seem larger than life in HD and add pure magic to absorb the visual elegance. All in all this phone provides all the pleasure in perfect ways to ride the experience of performance in cool avatar.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive']]
1. Great value for value 2. Excellent phone slim and trim 3. Rear camera is good in day light but in night camera doesn't perform well 4. I don't like it's front camera it gives yellowish tint on my face. I have heard of gcam so I downloaded and installed it. The quality of image for selfies are far better than stock camera, I will recommend to use gcam for selfie. 5. Battery backup is decent but this phone charges very quickly. 6. Many people doesn't like miui interface but in my experience it is to good there are to many added features because of miui, yes it sometimes lags because of that but i am ok with it. 7. Display quality is like of flagship phone. Beast in the industry. Only missing feature is on 120hz refresh rate. 8. Speakers quality are decent####[['camera operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'negative']]
Slim and weightless compared to all phone available. 90hz refresh rate is more than enough for those who are not in to heavy graphics games. And who are all not in games, this is an excellent choice which is a great value for money. One glitch for people who connect their phone to car Audio system for Android Auto or just thru USB, once you connect the phone to USB, the USB CONFIGERATION message would keep on flickering in the phone screen which will not allow to do anything untill you pull the USB off. After lot of googling, the only solution i could find is to use a less costly USB cable which does not supports quick charge. Understood XIAOMI doesn't care to sort this issue even lot of complaints to them. And so, if you are not in to connecting to Android Auto, music thru USB connection, this phone is an excellent choice with a luxurious look. Else, you will get irritated when u could not connect to your CAR music system . A major lapse from Xiaomi####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Better not to choose it just for display. It really has a Black Crush Issue. But everything else is good especially its Design. Battery back is better than expected for 4250mah. Performance is good. My experience on Bgmi is good as well. Camera is good enough for me especially more than satisfied for it's best Macro camera.

I am doctor. I required phone having good performance means reading books by pdf ,hassle free internet access and to attend online meeting and class and having good camera quality. Performance of this phone is good, good looking, good feeling in hand , but camera quality is not satisfactory specially when clicked of book . Have to charge 1 times per day or 2 times in a day if online classes attended.

I am writing this review after using phone for around six months. In terms of looks and design, phone looks great. Using this phone has exposed the reality of hypes created by xiaomi to buy its somewhat useless product. Xiaomi advertised as 10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision support for Netflix but these are either not usable or not existing at all. Being a phone with Amoled Display, I was expecting it to be True ALWAYS ON DISPLAY as shown in other Amoled phones of brands such as Samsung, Oneplus, Realme but here again Xiaomi cheated us and it can remain only for 10 seconds. Moreover, Xiaomi boasts of several long exposure modes but modes such as Light painting, Starry sky, Star trails etc cannot be used without a tripod. Xiaomi should have clearly written this in the product description rather than highlighting these modes to make people buy the product. After all this experience, I am not going to buy this THIRD CLASS Chinese brand phone ever again.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
There are white lines all over the display, when i am trying to put dark wallpaper, in contact app, phone dialer, basically anywhere there is grey or black background, so i have replaced the device i am hoping that this issue is only with my unit, this issue is very significant and visible, i have my finger crossed and hoping the new unit wont have this issue, rest the colors are very vibrant and display is very good in other cases, speakers are definitely great, battery is okay, works fine for a day, rest it would have been great if it was 4500mah battery, the design is really great, loved the back glass and texture, performance in day to day task is great but definitely not for gaming and i am kinda disappointed with it , cant even play genshin impact and this is not a budget device, so performance should have been better , pubg runs okay but frame drops, the phone is definitely not for gaming, but for a person who wants to consume media and day to day life it's great! Finger print is good, and placement is also fine, dont have much complaints with the device but the issues i have mentioned are really problematic.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive']]
This phone is great in terms of exchange value, sound quality through bluetooth and jack. physical aspect of slim phone and light weight frels great. However the displan has some bugs where black sesms greyish and dim black things in video are having no nights and it shows seprately. Its also called black crush issue.

After lot of search and reviews i purchased this mobile. Since I am using this mobile only for 3 days, i cannot put my full experience now. As of now camera performance is just ok and not as expected. Hope that camera performance will be improved by software updates by xioami. In my 3 days usage battery last for one day only on very moderate usage. Under heavy usage like shooting photos, videos, video streaming, little gaming, battery last for 4 to 5 hours only. Battery performance needs more optimization. Sound from speakers good. I felt little heating issues while charging, using cameras and sometimes playing videos. Only after a month of usage full pros and cons can be updated. At present only 3 star rating.####[['camera operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
This phone is overall nice. CAMERA QUALITY IS NICE. BATTERY BACK UP IS OK. ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS A HYBRID SIM CARD TRAY. AND HENCE USER CAN NOT USE 2 SIM CARD & SD CARD CONTINUOUSLY.

Camera is good, it could be more better. Battery is only 4250 mah which is not running for a day also. In dark mode, mobile data is getting freeze, after talking to customer care, he told to reset or go to service center.

This review is after using it for 6 months. The worst product on Amazon and probably Xiaomi is aware of this failure. All 4 stars and 5 stars on Amazon are not at all genuine and so are the paid reviews on you tube. Major pixellation and black crush issue is seen when streaming videos on Netflix or you tube or any other OTT platform. Camera is below par. This is biggest let down. Very unstable, just good looks otherwise pure dabba phone not worth even 15k. Please dont waste your hard earned money on this product. I have sold this dabba phone from Xiaomi and will never buy any xioami phone again. Indians are not to be fooled. Be careful guys and dont fall for cheap marketing gimmicks####[['platform general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
The phone is beautiful and great to hold, especially with the thin profile. The screen is also decent and the cameras in the right lighting do take decent shots. But the core issue with this phone is the network issues, this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently. Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength, signal quality and signal type. I have tried Jio, Airtel & Vodafone in the last 9 months, all with similar issues but especially so with Jio. Being a phone, if it can't make calls reliably it's an abject failure. So I would rate ZERO but doing the least I can at one.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Display is poor and text is not clear. Phone just hangs even if you're just minimising an app by pressing the home button. 6GB RAM (and RAM expansion) is a joke as it only hangs and the moment you switch to an app it always reloads the data/page. Imagine trying to copy the OTP from a msg and when you go back to the page to enter it, it reloads! Haven't seen a worse phone than this. Extremely poor RAM management. Typing/Keyboard isn't smooth, camera hangs everytime you open the camera app plus camera quality is poor, battery drains extremely fast, calling problems. My old phone works better than this. Their Customer Care is a joke, so good luck trying to get this faulty device exchanged. Final verdict - Avoid buying this. Go for anything else other than this phone.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory quality', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['memory design_features', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
It's almost 1 year and 8 months and the smartphone is working average. I do experience some crashes but ig I can bear that much in exchange of AMOLED screen and better camera+ fast charging. I am using this smartphone for AMV and the softwares I use are Node Video and Alight motion which are sometimes the heaviest apps in my smartphone but I can get 1080p so it's ok.

Perfect phone for its price. Saw some bad reviews, but may I know do they expect a phone quality in this price range?? For the price it's a good phone with g95 processor and getting to play BGMI with extreme settings. I haven't got any sort of issue till now. Not that much of heating, but while gaming there will be heating obviously... Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera. What else should we get in this price. Fingerprint sensor is working perfectly, Amoled display. Idk why some people expect more front his device.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive']]
I purchased this phone for my father and he is very happy with it. He has motibindu the amoled display is great for it plus it has ip57 rating 5000mh battery it easy last 2 and half day so you know his usage. And 33w charger is excellent in an hour it full charges. Camera is great but he rarely takes photos he uses ultra wide only. MIUI is fine I have disable all the ads and finally no bloatware in the phone out of the box so it is great news. Only issue is software update if redmi fix it then I have no problem with MIUI. I wanted to switch him to samsung but he is used to MIUI. But it was difficult to adjust for it so I made decision to stick with MIUI.####[['display quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long. I would charge it in the morning at 90%, and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80-85%. But if I use it heavily on phone calls, Netflix, Brave, Youtube, etc. then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20-30%. This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great. I would charge my phone for give or take 30-40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10-20% to 90-100. Fingerprint scanner works quite well. Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people. Sound quality of the stereo is really good. Quite loud and doesn't crack on full volume. The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point. I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected. It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone "head" first in and out of my pocket when listening to music.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive']]
Good phone at this price range. If you need a smart phone for its smart features for using it for studies or communication or professional / personal communication. This is a great one. The location of the fingerprint scanner (on the power button) is not ideal if you are a left handed person or if the phone is fixed on a mobile stand or a car phone holder. Not a negative but point to remember that there is no NFC or wireless charging feature####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive']]
The phone is really good and great value for money, easy to use and quite legible. Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom. She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows, the screen looks big and phone looks very premium. Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well. The only issue is the speakers, they could have been louder. Considering my mom watches lot of video on this, the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music, I am sure that is not good for the speaker. Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone. Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics, not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews. However took a decision to buy and try. Phone is worthy every penny. I got it around 13k. Great battery, works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day. Didn't try gaming. Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers . Refresh rate is also good. No lags. I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues. Best budget phone. All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k. General users can simply go for it. I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
The phone was hyped so much during launch. It is similar to ordinary mi phones. If you are searching a gaming phone, don't go for this.. After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also. The phone us having issues during software updates. My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working. Lost all my data.. The camera is normal similar to other phone camera. There is nothing like 64mp. The photos are ordinary.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'neutral']]
I bought it in 14999/ but in offline stores, it is easily available in 14000. Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls. Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11. Camera of this phone is below average, as usual in case of Xiomi. If you're purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks, simple go for samsung. Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays (xiomi was never in the race). It may look like less in weight but don't go with the sight it is heavy af. Only good thing about this phone is fast charging. If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone. I repeat never buy fkn Redmi, it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years.####[['os general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
Firstly, the phone is in this price range is awesome with sAmoled display. Display quality is very good but less brighter than Samsung's amoled panels. I can't recommend you this phone for Pubg, COD gaming because after 15 min this phone was heating like an iron with remarkable frame drops but day to day use and it would be okay to use. I'm not going to tell about bugs because it's MIUI's issue and will be solve with update. But battery is not like 5000 mAh, its display and android system is consuming too much brightness. Camera is good but sometimes colour is gone fade but you can use google camera for good portraits and to taking natural colour images ( here some clicks I have taken). By the way, its my honest review after using 8 days. You must buy this according to your criteria. But Xiaomi should cake immediate steps to solve these problems especially bettery , bugs, lagging and heating issues. Then we can prodly say it's the best phone under 12k.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Got this phone bacause of 2 main reasons over narzo 30 5g, one is good design, looks and display, second is IP53 rating... Almost satisfied except battery life and software issues... Battery draining very fast, and google chrome is not working well,crashing ever time I use google search, heavy notifications from miui.. Disappointed for these... Overall if you are concerned about 5g future ready, fastness in processor just avoid it.. Else ok to buy and install other browsers and bear with notifications, I m not talking about camera.. For this price range in any phone we won't get good camera, for 10s also it is not good, but I don't use camera often and not concerned about it..####[['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
I don't understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it's not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn't expect this from this phone.. Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product I don't know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone. Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone.. 64 mp.. It's picture quality is like 8 mp...####[['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative']]
If anyone want to buy this phone, let me clearly tell you that camera quality is worst. I bought and cant even comparing camera quality to any other same range smartphone. Look wise its ok, battery life is also 18 hour if use continue. Screen is good, sometime hang issue occurs. In terms of other features, its average phone. But if anyone wants to take good quality photo or video, then its not worth to invest in this phone.####[['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Phone is slow to read memory card and also to access camera. While open the camera, you may ashamed off infront of a group of people bcz of slow. I won't suggest to my friends. Display and main camera are good. Front protection glass is poor quality. Battery ok. Macro not good as expected. Compared to my 6years old Lenovo k4note(dual Dolby speakers) sound quality and speed also NOT impressed me. I hope a 1gb ram sufficient for our daily use except game, but this 4gb struggle to do our needs bcz of third party Mi User Interface disturbance.

Phone Brightness , is very bad , I have using always with full brightness , and Dual speaker both sides are working , but it is not louder than my previous single speaker mobile which is also mi Note 5 pro. Now a days mobile companies are not giving us proper quality of the mobiles as they sucked our money , they wanted us to do keep on buying new mobiles often. All are doing business tricks to use , india fast charging , India's first processor . They don't want to keep the Best Name Standard Mobile , quality of the products, in the market , they only aim is to suck the money , becoz it just buisness nothing personal.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['company quality', 'negative'], ['company price', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
This Mobile phone is Defective, there is compatibility issues in Software and Hardware. it had heating Problem, hang issue and, not working properly. After the mobile purchase I faced a Camera problem, I took approximately five or seven photos but the camera stopped working due to overheating. The YouTube application is not working, it has a hanging and Freezing problem so I am facing many problems and I have to restart the phone again and again. Many times, the Google assistant is automatically working without saying hi or hello to google or commanding it any other way and it is not working and when we give this command then this application does not work.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative']]
Writing this review almost after 1.5 year of buying this phone. Becauss This is the worst mobile experience I ever had, it hangs toooo toooo much. It is hanging right from day one, It hangs even while receiving a call, opening any application or doing anything, I don't know why this is happened but I bought this phone because earlier I had good experience of using redmi phones. I must also mention camera quality is very good, but basic functioning and processor of this mobile is worst ever.####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'negative']]
I bought this product thinking so that it will sum up all the things the display is very much clear and pleasant you can get all the colours even in sunlight but the thing here I was the disappointed with the camera the cameras are not very cool the front camera is specially it's not of worthy even when you take a selfie the sky colour is blue it will make it as a white colour where is in the rear camera the bokeh effect (potrait)can't be seen , if two persons are standing near by it will make only first person cleared the rest of other unclear the battry was quite good and the phone heating problem was not an issue design is elegant phone look premium 1, but the only thing which should all be looking to it's the camera quality the can give to camera in note 10 but they can't give a good camera in note 10s this is one of the cons which are not understood and I return this product and one more thing which I like to tell is that it's as refresh rate 60 hz but it's not performing as same so there is a jitteriness falling in the the screen .####[['display quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
My experience with this phone was nightmare. This phone have lots of issues like phone get Rebooting and again sometime 2 times in one hour , camera take black and white images and that too can't be opened. Error keeps coming that file is corrupted . It was on reboot loop for almost 15 hours. I have given my phone to service center 3 times under warranty. problems don't get resolved 2 times and I'm thinking to sell this phone rather giving it again to service center as i lost all my data.

I bought the 6/128 GB version. It's working quite well. I've too many apps installed, up and running, but it's still performing smooth. The primary camera also takes some good pictures. The display is quite natural, unlike those devices which show oversaturated colours. The charger is also of good quality. Two years OS upgrade and 4 years Security updates are also promised, let's see whether they deliver. Overall, going well!####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery quality', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
It served the purpose for which I purchased this phone. I was looking for a phone that is 5G ready, and after a few searches, I got a recommendation for this product. Everything is ok except the camera. The camera quality is not good, but it didn't bother me as I rarely use it. Overall, this is a Samsung phone, so performance and reliability are top of the line. There are other good options out there, but I prefer Samsung any day.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Its a nicely designed phone. camera quality is garbage touch is alright. heating issues as all samsung phones have. still considering the price range and other features that comes with the phone. Its a good phone.

Lot of apps are not compatible. I am surprised. I know the phone is cheaper and the expectations should be accordingly but I never thought that it will have restrictions on the app's. We'll if u really want to know which app I'm talking about, it's Insta 360. I have a camera and I want to use it but connecting it to my phone but the app doesn't support .Fingerprint doens't work properly.

I have purchased this phone 7 month back from Amazon. this phone has major issue with network. its started to drop network all of sudden. i have checked with customer service but they done software update 2-3 times and now they are saying motherboard needs to change. they are getting plenty complaints about this model and unable solves this. in this price range avoid to buy Samsung phone said by Samsung service center.####[['company general', 'neutral'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good! Reviews. But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast. This phone is an example. Only two months after purchase display hangs and hangs and hangs despite deleting videos, apps and caches. This phone doesn't have screen mirroring facility. Taking screenshots too could've been easier. Total disappointment and unworthy of money.

Had a display issue and screen lag immediately within the first week, but the return window expired, can't get a replacement told amazon customer care, forced to take it to the Samsung Service centre they got the phone and asked me to wait a minimum of 20 days or more to get the display fixed to cover it under warranty. no options. even a new release phone doesn't have a spare for India's leading market share mobile company.####[['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]

I usually like phones that can easily fit in my hands and pockets, so i was a lil bit hesitant to buy this at first. But after purchasing it, i didn't have any single regret on buying this phone, i have to say, its worth it, the phone is lightweight and the screen resolution is brilliant as well.

First time I ain't happy with mi product! Slim phone, processing is okay! Camera not so okay, photos are quite dark, the balance of colors is not that great.

The battery gets heated fast in 10 mins while running any application The connective problem, voice disturbance. Network showing 2-3 lines the, the person gets out of network record. The fingerprint sensor is not good, have to use it multiple times.

This is the best one for gaming,best phone under 12000. But the camera filter is not so good,but also I'm happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi, gta, critical strike and many games at a time,and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay. This phone is not for reel'stars or photography.

Its really a good find for me TECNO POVA 4 in 12k budget. After a complete 4 day use I must say that this a phone which I was looking for months. Its big memory 13GB & 128GB storage keeps all my things intact. I played a few heavy games & I am quite satisfied with the performance Even selfies & back camera are a real good one & gives professional pictures. A massive 6000 mAh battery is super for an all-day use !!####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k. I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios. if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios. hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look. And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support. Now I am not happy with this device. Wish i had gone with poco, the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues. And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates. Plus you got to stick with booring hios.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['memory design_features', 'negative']]

When this is a camera highlighted phone, the camera should have been far better. The camera does not capture good shot at all, in the case of moving objects it can not get much worse than this phone. The back of the orange one is getting heavily dirtier. Because of accidental touch sensibility the screen gets awake which is very much disturbing. I had to resell this phone with a loss of 14k after using for 1 & 1/2 month as the brand does not have much brand value in the market.

Let me start with positive. The only thing you will like in this phone is memory and that's it. Camera picture quality is average. Touch is average. Now, negative. Battery backup is poor. Even when you put single jio sim battery lasts for couple of hours. If you use social media apps it will drain within hour. OS is slow. Screen size is small in this prize range.

This is really worst phone that I have a boy but due to respect and frame of jio I buy this phone but this really didn't match my expectations and its really battery life is really worst than ever expected even a feature phone could have a better battery life and it's having a problem in my unit if I say in my device it's automatically get switch off and restarts it's own whether I am using a call or using a social media####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
I am a traveller and often go on long treks and hence wanted a durable phone that also had long lasting battery life. I was going on a trek and the C11 is the only phone i took with me and i have to say i was very very impressed especially with the battery life. Generally during trek we don't get much access to plug ports hence i wanted a long battery life and the phone gave me just that, and when i turned on power saving mode was the best, this one week, i ran the phone without charging for 4 days.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive']]
Have been looking for a phone to start online classes for my children, was looking for something afforable but also something that can do daily work very well and can play some games also.

Have been looking for a phone for my parents and my aunt at my hometown and wanted an affordable and good option.

Its been almost 1month, and I use this for daily purpose. Sometimes feels lag, and does not shutdown or restart properly, gets hanged in the middle of important task.

All smartphone features working as per the budget. Can be a good first smart phone for elderly switching from basic mobile to smart phone. For sure features are not as good as 12-13k phone but for this budget good enough. So if budget permits go for 12k+ phone with same features but better performance. Missing finger print scanner is the feature I feel would have made this more worthy as face scan works less than 50% of the time. Battery lasts more than a day with moderate use.

Best iPhone from Apple. Display, camera, video quality is top notch. Any other mobile can’t match up to iPhone 14 pro max. AOD is slightly brighter which will drain phone battery by 7% over night. Epic battery performance. Better to disable AOD until it gets fixed by any new update. Rest all features of the mobile is top class. Dynamic field notification is classy.

Worth is subjective and differs from person to person. I’m not sure why everyone keeps comparing this to previous year iPhone as normal people usually upgrade from 2 or 3 generations. I’m upgrading from iPhone 11 Pro and I have plenty to like on the phone. The camera, the display, 120hz refresh rate and dynamic island. Overall it’s a worthy upgrade for me.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
I like the delivery on time and this new iphone is very improved and has better build quality and on hand feel is very good, if you are buying it for camera, then there nothing changed in iPhone 13 and iphone 14 , both cameras are same but if you want features than you should go with iPhone 14 , it has many new features and improved features, overall mobile is good####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
As always , samsung disappointed me again, i purchased this phone because of the new processor which had scored 4 lakh+ in antutu. But it doesnt work well, camera is very bad , bezzels are really big, and due to its thickness if i put back cover on it becomes really bulky. I wont suggest anyone to buy this. It lags in small games, 90fps but still my 3 years old device runs better than this####[['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
Slow motion video making is missing and screen comes with 90hz refresh rate and photo editing in which we can remove anything is missing while samsung galaxy m33 comes with more feature than this a14 at a lower price so what's the point of raising the price and cutting the features. This is really disappointing from samsung . Team samsung should really look into this it really hurts####[['display operation_performance', 'neutral'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
Don't take this mobile if you intend to use the hotspot feature. The other devices you connect to it will lose connection so often that it is frustrating. Every half an hour you will need to switch off and switch on the hotspot. Battery barely lasts 6-8 hours with hotspot and 12-14 hours otherwise. Call quality, touch are good. Bloatware is as is usual in samsung####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive'], ['company general', 'negative']]
I dont know why one or other tech youtuber is complaining about oxygen OS, frankly speaking, awesome clean user interface, fluid OS, gaming is beast in OP 10T , camera is good but not superb but still very good in this price bracket, gets super charged in just 14 mins from 1to100 %, battery performance is tooo good doesn't drain like other phones, after 1 hour of heavy gaming it only drains about 8 to 10%, Genshin Impact runs like a beast in ultra settings, stereo speakers output is gr8 very crisp, loud n clear.

Hello all, I've been using this phone for past couple of days. It's an excellent phone to use with. Performance is fantastic followed by the battery life. I'm not a core gamer, I am getting battery life of 48 hours. User interface is excellent, the processor is super fine. The camera isn't splendid, however does the job. Overall it's a very good performance driven phone, which fulfils the daily need. Kudos to the 160 W charger, it charges the phone in 15 minutes. I'm enjoying it. My recommendation is very simple, if you seriously want to spend 50k for a phone then go for it, otherwise look for affordable options.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
I have seen Many Reviews which which is also positive nd negative... okay that some users are not happy with the device May b it's bcz they are watching many yt videos which Many nonsense youtubers comparing this one with iqoo but I tell you guy's Don't go for the review just check out yourself the only thing is you should need to have better knowledge of smartphone nd is otherwise you people will never get happy with even an iPhone also...yaa it's getting heat while charging but it's Just bcz of it's Superfast Speed nothing else... it's just like Howmuch speed You Drive The Bike That Much The Silencer Will Get heat...Nd After sometime it will get cool...So The Phone don't Have Any Problems Even The Battery Backup is Almost 10-12hrs on Havey Use otherwise on normal use it will give almost 1Day Backup... believe me The Phone Is Fantastic With Latest Processor nd Latest Os Just Go For It... Better To Buy 8+128####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
I have been a royal one plus customer,started with One plus 3T. My last phone was One plus 8T, though I missed the alert slider for 2 days...now i got used to it so it was not a big con for me. The major uplift from 8T was charging time 100percent in 20mins... was mindblown and then a good level up in the camera segment too. Was little hesitant about the phone back panel, but in hand it looks gorgeous with curved camera segment and a premium finish. Was impressed when One plus gave me a 160W charger in box unlike IPhone (Pun intended), and also a jade green silicone back cover which I'm currently using due to unavailability of cover due to new model release. Applications are opening blazing fast and no heating issues when I played Asphalt and PUBG mobile. Overall happy with the product and a decent upgrade from my previous mobile.####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Everything is but bgmi game lacks in frame drops in this device maybe it's due to its ban in India as of my thoughts and I have noticed that like all the flagship this mobile is getting some what heat after using for continuously for even 30mins but compared to all flagship mobile brands it is heating 50% less over all a performance beast with a superb charger Main Camera sensor is at its best regarding that two other cams were not up to the mark and Stereo Speakers were best but not as best as Harmon kardon speakers of Xiamoi mobile.####[['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
A rare combination of high-end specs delivering a stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS. I was not expecting such a blistering performance from an Android device. Although there are few compromises on the hardware front such as removal of alert slider button, it's certainly not a deal breaker. The design of the phone is not pathbreaking, but actually could differentiate from other me-too phones. The unique camera setup helps to differentiate this phone with others. It's a kind of proprietary design for One Plus 10 series. The photos come good if not excellent. I could buy it at 36k with ICICI bank CC offer, combined with an exchange. At 36k it's a steal for sure. If you are looking for a real fast phone, has a decent 6.7 inch-120 Hz screen, a unique look to flaunt, One Plus 10T presents itself as a worthy option to consider.####[['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
It is a decent phone. Battery discharge quickly and you have to charge it. it takes just 10 to 15 mins to charge. Thanks to super voc 150w adapter. Camera is good but some times the result is blurry images. Heating when you use Snapchat or camera after 5 mins of use. Phone case is good but glassie finish is no use when it is with covered with phone case. Keyboard is overlapping when you open WhatsApp chat...

Display, battery,charging and gaming is great on this. Camera is good not great, but takes good enough photos on main camera. Gaming is great , i played BGMI in max settings for more than 2 hours never got above 39°C and cools down pretty fast.Alert slider is a major missing coming from OP7, Oxygen OS is color OS with fast and clean UI. No bugs or lags ever faced.Overall I am satisfied for what I paid.####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'positive']]
The product is good.however, te macro lens of 2mp is really a waste. One going for 16gb ram, please either go for OnePlus 10 pro or oneplus 11. However, the charging period is really very very less. I learnt with this purchsaing , that macro lens Haas currently no use in current gen phones. Please prefer telescopic lens camera. You will certainly feel proud of it.

didn't expect this from one plus. After one month of use the phone started showing some issues mostly in network issue and always having a issue while the time of attending phone calls. Every time when I get a phone call if I accept the call the opposite person cannot hear me either he needs to call me again or else I should call him it is happening every time. And the phone screen stucks sometimes for 10 to 20 seconds. Really pathetic phone. I won't recommend to anyone####[['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative']]
Like only display and spekar sound , there is unlike too much, high end device i used it for 7 to 10 days it's found hanged during app use, and opening with fiingureprint , i m very disappointed to much bugs have on this device , call end but display shows in call , like it's hangs or not work , some time too much leg on app , front cam to much worst quality of pic and video calling also , double tap awake is not working , it's working on its mood , fiingureprint not recognisedany times , and too much bugs with 8 gen 1 , i never forgot this high end device ,####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative']]
I have used OnePlus x and OnePlus 5 before and enjoyed them both...my OnePlus 5 lasted me for 4.5 years...brought the phone on launch date....went in expecting good experience and was fooled. Though the battery and camera are undoubtedly better, the phone is not even able to run YouTube w/o glitches. If I try and exit before video ends, the app over app or even normal version freezes up. And nothing works except for a phone restart. And this is not just for YouTube...amazon prime video and other streaming apps play so glitchily.... Every day I'm having to restart atleast twice. Worst phone.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Dislike - UI, performance, speed, API function, all in all not worthwhile Not at all worth if we talk about the performance. I am using OnePlus since four years and with these model i am no longer one plus fan and last phone i am using from one plus, so disappointed wasted huge chunk for such a waste. Worst performance of all the one plus phones I had used till the date, worst performance if we take about performance speed and UI, so many small glitches i am facing each day while using the phone.,####[['software general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
OnePlus 10T is inferior to OnePlus 5T which I used for more than 3 years with not even a single hand issue or lag in performance...Whereas with 10T With in one week I saw multiple hang issues and app lags and disappearing logos during calls with full blank screen...Need to press power button couple of times and start afresh. So disappointed with OnePlus this time.....i will not recommend to buy now...####[['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Awesome I just love Mi products... Its my 3 Mi smartphone. 2 gifted and 1 for my personal. About the product its has good battery backup unless u r full day using YouTube videos.. Otherwise it will go full day without charging. This is as per my experience though. I m YouTube addicted. On daily basis i m on YouTube. Anywyas it has good sound good looking big screen ... No hang problem at all. I play lot of mobile games n my net is always on and proving WiFi hotspot... Overall my experience is m delighted..

I purchased it since before several months but today I am writing review of it, I think up till now this mobile phone might have gone outdated. Any way this Red me note 4 is going trouble free and I have not faced any problem. Touch pad working perfectly, being 4000 mah battery no problem very well battery backup.

Redmi Note 4 is overall a very good android phone. It has a good battery life- 4100 mAh, and it is lasts close to a whole day without requiring to charge frequently. Using the phone is very smooth as it has up to a 4GB RAM. It does not slow down even if many applications are open. It has speaker grilles that are placed at the bottom, and the sound quality of the phone is impressive too. It has a 13MP camera, and the photos turn out great. It has a 64GB storage, which is a sufficient capacity. It has a warranty of 1 year for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories from the date of purchase. I would recommend this product, as it is an efficient product at a good price.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]

Upgraded from my Mi4i to Note 4, and so it was familiar terrain! As always, with the 4GB RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage, it was huge leap forwards in online actions and applications. The touch sensitivity is excellent and the camera remains a strong feature for me. The only negatives I felt were an element of heating on continuous use and longer battery charging time. Overall, for me, a total value for money piece, considering that it was combined with an exchange offer plus cash discount on card - truly "Price Less" !!####[['display quality', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
Redmi Note 4 remains a very popular obile phone and was the most popular in 2017. However with the passage of time the front camera need update and the software becomes slow. The primary problem with such Chinese origin phones is their reluctance to learn from Apple.The hardware remains an issue and these phones are primarily targetting the Lower Middle Class segment who constitute the bulk of Mobile set consumers in India at present. Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi must develop in this aspect.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
Quite poor performance.. While playing a particular song, it is showing error, 'can't play the song', very irritating. In another educational app I installed, the videos are not running smoothly, buffering a lot. At last, any good quality screen guard is not fitting or suitable to this mobilehandset, air bubbles are very much visible in both sides. Coming to camera, the rear camera is not good, the flash light turns the photo, your skin colour yellowish. I am dissatisfied with the handset. I don't recommend this to anyone.

I ordered this product. It is very nice product. However, the product has some problem with its mic or speaker. When making a call n put it on hands free the person on other end of the call complains of noise and all. Also, when I go to recording application, there is lot of noise when I play the recording.

Battery life excellent for heavy usage Fell down 3 times but thankfully screen did not break Might get a good protective case Finger placement has to be precise to work smoothly Invest in a good case to avoid shattering of glass Hasn't lagged once due to massive ram I usually do not free my ram but it works wonders even if there are like 20 plus apps open i can still play pubg smoothly  Be careful with the glass I'd really like an overhaul of the miui but one can hope Currently running on miui 10.

Its a good device to buy under 10 k. Was worried about its built quality before buying it but found it worthy. Giving 5 star for its performance and for buity quality. Camera quality is fine and front camera with led flashlite is awesome feature. Youngsters and womens can prefer this phone more due to its camera quality, good performance on apps like tick tok and vigo. Battery is ok as in idle condition battery drains very less but once you start using internet the draining speed is high.. with very limited internet usage it can give battery life of about 2 days and otherwise 1 day backup.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]
I have been using this phone for more than 6 months. Touch wood till today I have not faced any problem neither in hardware not in software. Touchscreen is smooth, camera works decently, good sound system. It's a best budgeted phone in the market.

Using the phone from last one year. Only set back is the camera. The picture quality is very bad in low lights. The phone as compared to it's previous models is very sturdy and strong. I have dropped it end number of times and the screen is still intact. Speed of the phone is also very good. I had played games like Modern Combat, Brothers In Arms, etc and it never lags.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
Front camera quality is excellent, we wish rear camera can be like that. But it is dull wrt front camera. With rear camera need to look proper light angle for better photo. Battery can be last 2 days, required to do daily recharge. Calendar shows all un-necessary information like big billion day, day details therefore we have to search our important event which we have saved for reminder. Sound reminder for event is good.

I got this in April'19. The phone is good quality. the camera is decent. 6GB RAM get the job done nicely. BUT the battery is not at all useful. One full charge dosent last a day. I really need to run around trying to find a charger by the evening. Also the phone heats up if watch videos for more than 20 mins.

This is the best one for gaming,best phone under 12000. But the camera filter is not so good,but also I'm happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi, gta, critical strike and many games at a time,and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay.

Its big memory 13GB & 128GB storage keeps all my things intact.

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k. I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios. if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios. hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look. And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support. Now I am not happy with this device. Wish i had gone with poco, the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues. And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates.

Review after several days use. It's really nice phone. Back camera is really awesome. Front camera/ Battery backup is good. Display is awesome. Touch and Feel is also so nice. Only few thing like macro camera not useful, one speaker is not loud. But both speaker delievers good quality. Battery backup should have slightly more. It's last 1 day if we use average + 4-5 hours of video watching.

But 5G is needed because most of the mobiles come in 5G under 15k. So who don't want 5g you can go to this. But overheating is more when heavy apps are used. Display is very good.

Pics of 32MP of a few other phones are better than pics taken in this 108MP. Pics taken at low light is also extremely worst. Please avoid this phone if your primary preference is camera. Battery life is good. But it's of no use if camera is extremely worst.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
1. Dual speakers are not giving overall good quality sound. Only one speaker is working properly, the other one is having very low sound as compared with first one. 2. While on call, voice is not coming properly which creates problem to listen the conversation. 3. also, speaker and hold options during call are lagging for 2 seconds if applied. 4. 108 MP camera is not giving such amazing pictures. when zoomed, pictures get blur. image quality is same as 64 MP camera. 5. battery backup is also not worthy.####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
Using this from 7 days now (8gb 128gb variant, black) Like : good refresh rate, display is nice, camera is average, ram 8gb plus booster 3gb available, charges quickly around 40mins full charge, no heating issues. Dislike : the phone sound system is extremely low, it's speaker seems so less in volume. My redmi note 7 pro has got better speaker than this. Despite giving full volume I can hardly hear the ringtone a room apart, if I place this phone in full volume in my bag I cannot hear the ring even a bit, same is the case with alarm tone, speaker during the call. Really bad one. I gifted a redmi 9activ to my househelp, her phone speaker works 100 times better than this.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
The product comes with lots of promises. While it certainly has good functional features, in terms of camera and battery life, the manufacturer have compromised a lot in terms of durability. Its highly fragile and comes with high risk of screen damage with slightest of shock or fall. Worst part, since its a new model, the service team does not even have spare parts to fix the same. I am having horrible experience in getting the screen replaced which is already delayed by a week now which has never been the case with Samsung. Overall this is a learning for me NOT to go for any budget model specially from Redmi...####[['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
I purchased this phone at price of 17000 but its worst in segment low picture quality and camera quality don't fall for 108 megapixel camera. It's Sensor is worst . Also it's speaker is so slow and stereo speakers are just for decoration no use of it. Call voice is also very low. Overall this phone is just a waste from Xiaomi####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'negative']]
Very pathetic camera. Over heating outdoor in the normal Indian temperature. I have captured the video with my another phone outside the service centre. After they gave me an advice that i must use the phone inside the house when AC is on. As well as keep the Wi-Fi, and other options off while using the phone camera. Service center will not solve your problem. I got it back. I shoot the video in front of the service centre. It was about 11 o'clock morning, normal temperature around 35 degrees.  It's completely waste of money. My old Motorola working fine. No such issues. But this one is garbage. I won't recommend anyone to by this phone. Even redmi Xiaomi has same heating issues in other models.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
If you need an iOS device at low price, go for it. For camera freaks not recommended if you are into telephoto clicks because it doesn't have a telephoto lens. But best in its class. I do remember it had the best camera after after pixel 2 xl and huawei p30 pro. Good battery life. Gets you through the day with moderate use but do buy a 20 w charger. Ahead of times processor, no question about that. Screen goes upto 1080p 60hz, not recommended if you use a 120/90hz device already, you will get stuck at slow motion. nice speakers if you still listen to music on speaker...it has that iconic punch of a little base that every iPhone has. But I do recommend to go for the higher variants if not necessarily an emergency to have an iOS device. If you are okay with an android device I do recommend comparing it with others like OnePlus, samsung, nothing etc, once.####[['camera general', 'neutral'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
I have used iPhone 11 since 3month It gives me a smooth experience with beautiful premium feel and good Camera quality. iPhone 11 runs one day very easily (I’m a medium to moderate user) . A13 Bionic chip works very well in gaming multi tasking and it’s also power efficiency. I had an android phone user , but I hade ipad since 3 years (Not new in iOS ) . I have purchased it in sale around 39k price .  You can go for iPhone 12 for getting a beautiful display experience. iPhone 11 display not bad , it beats with 25k flagship android display.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu quality', 'positive']]
As for now It is a best value for money iPhone. If you want to experience iphone with a modern looks you should go for this. If camera is not your number one priority then it will be a good choice for you. Dont get me wrong. Camera of iPhone xr is good enough but you will not get wide angle shots so if potrait and wide angle shots are your priority then go for iPhone 11 instead. Battery life is good and give me a good battery life for a day. I can say if your budget is tight and around 30 to 35k only then go for this.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get(Bought in amazon sale) for this price. I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving. Think twice if you’re making switch from android, coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you’ll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except. It gives you 1 and half to two days of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you’ll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
iPhones are the most premium mobile devices money can buy. If u have a budget just go for it, You won’t regret it. Coming to iPhone 11 it’s the most affordable of the lot and feels really premium. Though it’s not 5G but it doesn’t matter 5G won’t be coming anytime soon and even if it comes it would be very expensive so one can easily go for it. Coming to the lcd screen trust me won’t notice any difference it’s Apple quality LCD and the company would not compromise on quality. Camera is best especially in the low light performance is really impressive. And coming to the battery life it’s really impressive on moderate uses u can easily get 8+ hours of screen on time.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['company quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
Amazing phone but as the other reviews say, yes it has heating issues but you won’t get to know if you have a thick back cover. Battery life is average, not too good not too bad. Color is amazing, performance is really good. Doesn’t hangs or lags. Video and Camera quality is good. Facial recognition has some issues though. Not happy with that functionality####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'negative']]
Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed ..its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick ,camera quality is top notch ,battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet####[['camera quality', 'positive'], ['shipping quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Bought the iPhone few days. Actually after seeing the white colour I felt had to order different colour though, but it’s fine as long as ur using cover it doesn’t matter. Coming to looks it’s average as described earlier and battery back up is really good. Camera quality is just good no doubt in that. Very crisp, sharp and colours are defined well.

This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone. The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android. And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can’t beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.####[['os general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Charging cable quality v poor. Battery is good but not for a whole busy day with all its features. Its terrible thing is, some heating issues while fast charging and heavy using but this could be managed. Rest features like Camera, face lock , mic, speaker else are good average as this is iphone. Well I’m not a heavy user so enjoying this iphone 11 so much. And his 3100mh something battery capacity is very low for gamers.####[['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'neutral']]
Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]
I bought this phone for my brother. He said that this product is getting heated a lot. He checked the serial number in Apple site and the product is genuine. I am using iPhone from iphone 3g almost 11 years. No issues like heat or anything else. I bought those phones from directly Apple US. He will check with Apple. Another guy is using 11 and no heat issue for him. I am not sure if this lot has issue. Will update once he sends it to the apple service center and get it back.####[['phone usability', 'negative']]
Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8. It feels like degradation for me from bigger and more clear display to small LCD with no refresh rate. Major pain area is battery charging from 15mins of oneplus to hours for iPhone. Feature rich shortcut in oneplus to static options like no shortcut for turning on or off location.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive']]
I don’t think the quality of phone is good. Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store. The phone hangs few times everyday. Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well.

Many time observed network issue. The phone shows 4g and full coverage, but sometime not receiving calls and it is responding out of coverage area at the same time I can make call no issues. I am using two different circuits (VI&Jio) both of them have same issue, but the same SIMs are working perfectly in other phone.

This monster of a phone is the best one in the segment. Camera photo quality is just mind blowing and the legend design gets everybody's attention. Whenever, I take it out, everybody is like, wow, what phone is this? And, the photo quality is great too.

This is amazing phone under 60k. Good display. And usage u won't get any lag. Funtouch os is good but need small improvements. Camera department is awesome. Selfie camera is good. I attached one file with back camera. Battery is good. Last 1 day for an moderate user. But for heavy users need to charge again in the evening. It becomes hot while charging and it takes 25 mins for full charge.  Overall it is agood phone under 60k with all flagship features. Better than high range samsung and iPhone in value for money. If u have that much high budget can go for big phones. Build is awesome. Even if is not ip rated there are YouTube videos showing it is water resistant and tolerating water immersion.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]
i was bit hesitant since i read couple of reviews here.but then i thought to give a chance to myself to buy this try this out.

I am using this phone from 2 days.. Mobile was very good,smooth, Performance was good and best part is charging,finger print 1.Os level I didn't felt any difference as I am using vivo before ,Some Android 12 features are missing(Colour Palette) and more shortcuts, personalizations should be added 2.Wide angle and potrait photos should be improved through software updates 3.Camera Features are more in IQOO9 than Pro like long exposure,super night video, documents etc...Little disappointed 4.IP68 rating was missing at this point (If this is included best all-rounder phone in 2022) 5.HDR Certificate is not available for Netflix when mobile has supported hardware 6.Privacy toggle shortcuts, other toggle shortcut,Drive mode , 3 Types of dark mode should be added####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'neutral'], ['os general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative']]
The display is really good and the charging speed is also as advertised but the battery seems to be discharging quickly than expected. I charged it at 85% and it discharged to 70% by the end of the day on standby. The battery optimization could have been better. Also prime video didn't support 1080p playback initially, don't know if it was a bug or something, but it's working fine now. I got it at a huge discount but if ur paying the full amount, there are many other options to consider.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['battery design_features', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
I have been using phone for a while , phone is fully loaded with features and feels premium with super fast charging to 100% within 15-20 min , only problem is it's battery life as it drains quickly, which is a very big negative point for such an expensive smartphone.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
The phone is great, super smooth, love the display. Charging is super quick. A great device. The trouble comes in the software, calls some times connect but there is no sound of the other person. The in display scanner sometimes just disappears and then you have to restart the phone. While using the camera app the the shutter button just disappears. I hope this gets fixed with software updates.

This phone has a punch in spec sheet, but when it comes to reality, it's overpriced, thermal solution needed improvement, finger print reader fails to detect any of your fingers when using a screen protector (tamper glass or UV glass), looks are lot better than i expected, it's a decent package but i think it's value is around 50k, but iqoo charging 65k for this.####[['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
It's been 10 days using this phone and I must say I am in love with it, except the battery. I hardly get 2 hours sceeen on time. Even when the phone is in idle state, it loses battery. I have to charge it at least twice in 15-16 hours. What the hell will I do with the performance if I do not have enough juice to run it. Seriously IQOO, do something about the battery. It's simply pathetic.####[['battery general', 'negative']]
Previously i had oppo find X2 which was 10x better than this. Battery lasts for long but can't use for long continuous. Every device heats up while heavy usage but it'll restrict you from using heavy which you might find in games even in UI, all over screen some thing like a earth quake in side the screen. There isn't a quick switch for data sim in the pull down which would be a better option. I should have choosen some other device. Low camera quality and worst clarity pictures. Unstable UI all made me feel I've made a big terrible mistake.

I saw some reviews and purchased this. However the phone is good looking and has the latest 8gen processor, fast charging, battery charges in 10 to 15 mins sometimes. I am not happy with the overall feel. There are still issues of video lag and stutter while watching movies or online content. Vivo needs to come out with a update to solve the issue.####[['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
I won't suggest anyone to buy this phone. I had seen many reviews before buying this but the price and performance didn't turnout to be reasonable. It'll heat up, it'll lag and it's just been a year of me using this phone. With specs provided you shouldn't feel the lag while gaming but I warn you, you'll realise the heat decipated from back and which will lead to normal apps to malfunction. You may experience static home screen where you won't be able to click on app or even restart your phone like I faced. I would suggest you to go for other brands like one plus or Samsung for the same price.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]

First time owning a One Plus device.. Camera is absolute delight with so many options.. charging is ultra fast, by the time you shower your phone is charged. Only thing is sustainability of battery. Some inbuilt options are there, has to see how it works in the long run. Switching between apps, ease of access is smooth. Ticks all the box for me.. except that placing of volume button and extra button for silent mode, vibrate mode using push button. Sometimes by mistake mode of volume changes, and will take some time to adjust to that.. rest all ok.

I upgraded from iphone xs and I am pretty happy with it. The feature it provide are only present in iPhone pro models which are above 1.2 lakhs currently. The best thing is battery charging speed around 25 min for full charge and it can stay for 1 day normally. The screen resolution and adaptive refresh rate is also a plus. I am not a camera fan but it captures great night shots. With 4 years OS update and 5 years security update and wifi 7 update are the best things the company is offering. In Love with this mobile . Haptics are again next level and it provides support of Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos .

I have bought this device on 13th March 2023, It good in built quality and even it's has the same processor of Samsung S23 ultra and the price is also only half of it. It has a good battery life.

xcellent device for the price. I'm writing this stubby review and will use it as a running log to report the good and bad about the device. Until now, the phone feels great! Definitely feels like the old OnePlus of yore, and the good part, thankfully.  The handfeel is very good, it masks the weight and size of the device, designed quite well.  It's a joy to type on (fabulous haptics!).  The screen is really good.  The battery life seems to be holding up well (using on qHD + 120hz).  It did heat up during the initial setup but calmed right down after a while. Not heatup up during normal usage. Did get warmish during a Super-Sus session (not blazing hot, just warmish).####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive']]
Apart from a couple of bugs that I noticed in my daily usage, this seems like an outstanding phone. Nothing that cannot go away with an OTA update or two. Charging speed is insane and battery life won't let you down. Camera is decent enough for clicking pictures. I am not into vlogging so I don't really bother about the front camera capabilities of not being able to record a 4K video. Sound is loud and crisp. UI is highly customisable and I keep it the way I like. Feels like a premium phone and is surely a noticeable device.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is good ,battery is also excellent.But built quality I m unsure...as with the one plus cover on the handset the phone should be safe...but it just fell once from my hand and the back side panel got slight crack ... I agree it's my fault...but I have been using one plus phones last 5 years ...always used it roughly but it has great durability...  This time I m little upset. I will try for replacement of back panel.. hopefully they give me that option as it's under warranty.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive']]
I am using One Plus 11 from last one and half month, it has lots of issues as face unlock, finger print unlock some times it stop when scrolling the screen, camera quality is good. The worst this is its volume button has stuck in side and it is not working, its volume button has stopped working in online one and half month. Before One Plus 11 i was using One Plus 5 that was a great product of One Plus in compare of One Plus 11. I had used One Plus 5 for 5 years and i was fully satisfied with that. I didn't face a single issue with that phone. That's why again i go with One Plus but this time it disappointed me.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative']]
I was previously using oneplus 6 and upgraded it to 11 after a long long waiting. This is just amazing...I am able to charge it fully within 30 mints even with my old samsung/mi charger!!! Display is smooth and even better than samsung s22. Battery can last 2 days if you are not a gamer. ONLY BAD EXPERIENCE IS WITH THE SELLER DARSHITA ELECTRONIC, who promised one year Prime membership.But did not give me the offer, even amazon customer service refused to help me.

Software experience is pathetic and painful in one word. Colour OS in the name of Oxygen is very much glitchy. YouTube is stucking, FB reels are stucking to start, when sharing any file from file manager via WhatsApp to multiple person it's not working. With more than 60K, the software experience is none other than a below 10K mobile.####[['software general', 'negative']]
The phone has too many bugs. Like annoyingly so. WhatsApp shows old messages instead of new ones, pointer speed (touch sensitivity) is confusing and not ideal (too much makes you swipe back when you actually wanna swipe left). The phone hearing volume is very low compared to older models and other phones. Even Spotify. Sms app has a bug.

After couple of days after receiving the phone, the volume down button stops working and the lower part of the button went inside the phone and the day later the volume up button stopped working as well, I don't understand if it's the phone defected or it's the OnePlus build quality . If it's the OnePlus build quality that is dropped then surely OnePlus should improve a lot in that because I have been using 1+ 7 T from 3 years and I have never seen any issue with that and it had bent and shattered and still it works. So compared to that OnePlus seem dropped thier build quality.####[['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['company quality', 'negative']]
1. Battery consumption is too much. 2. Worse experience on google photos, youtube, games. As typical oneplus phone, all these apps will run on 60Hz refresh rate which is unacceptable with respect to price. 3. Too much battery drain if 5g connection enabled. If you want a flagship experience smooth display, better spend more and get s23 because this 60hz refresh rate might give you headache.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative']]
Pathetic camera experience. Photos and videos taken by oneplus 11 is over sharpened and also having unrealistic color processing by default photo app. Don't know what Hasselblad collaboration is actually delivering. I have been using oneplus 5 for last six years and a happy customer, but after buying oneplus 11 my expectation on oneplus phone has gone down. Even old oneplus 5 is taking much better photo/video than this high cost nonsense product. Today mobile phone is used for taking pictures and videos to capture great memories, and oneplus is failed to deliver satisfactory results.Those who are buying this phone for photography, then don't spend your valuable money for oneplus 11, instead think for others.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]
I thought it would be a good phone for the next 3 to 5 years. But I am facing an issue with Wi-Fi connectivity. Even though it gets connected to Wi-Fi, the network activity is zero. Also facing issue with recording calls. I haven't tested the camera completely, but with the reviews that I read, looks like the camera set up is disappointing. Battery life is average, and with the fast charger, one can charge 0% to 100% in 20 mins, so the battery is not of a concern. Screen is not dazzling. But overall I am disappointed with the phone because of the Wi-Fi connectivity and recording calls.####[['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
Exchanged ONE PLUS 7T to buy this phone. If you are upgrading from lower version of OP to this one just because of camera,please dont. Its camera/video is of pathetic quality as comapred to OP 7T . Quality of Still photo and Video degraded over time . In protrait mode it make background blur which can be done merely downloading any free app from playstore. 2x Optical zoom,Front Camera quality is not so good too. No need to spend lots of money for this hoax marketing.####[['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
The product delivers what it says and is completely worth the asking price of <9k. Display, processor and storage are really good (and fast 90hz & UFS 2.2). Audio output from speakers is not that great same with the camera's, both front and rear cameras are pretty bad. But for the asking price, i think its reasonable. I mainly use it as a secondary device, so the battery backup and near stock android OS is great.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['storage general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
It's way better than what I expected. I gifted this to my Grandfather, he is very happy as it checks all the boxes. Fast charger and Mobile pouch(cover) are included in the box. They are giving 80% of the features for 20% price. Excellent screen quality, fast charging, decent facial recognition, fast finger print scanner, very big screen for watching videos and long lasting battery backup.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
After using this phone for 3 days, I realised the phone is pretty good ok this segment under 10k. However, I totally understand that we can't expect a very good camera as somewhere the company needs to compromise. The camera is good during daylight but in night time there are grains.. I tried the pro mode and if you know it well you can use the same camera to reduce the grains. Also, gyroscope is not there so for PuBg people who plays it via gyro .....it's a no no  Otherwise it's good in this series....####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative']]

I'm using this device without back cover and tempered glass, it has fell many times on solid stones like on granet and in bathroom rough stones but I'm impressed by its build quality, camera is top class, battery boost charge it's best..helps charging your phone in a few minutes just go n come back from washroom it'll be ready to take him out, music sounds good but little less volume due to improved quality, curved display gives premium look and I've never faced any disturbance on screen smooth n crisp.. supermoon mode of camera can take a pic of moon very good.. different modes of inbuilt camera n videography.. looks premium holding in hand.. little slippery but you'll like three slimness of this device.. go for it you'll love it🫰####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'neutral'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive']]
Display features are endless similar to S22 ultra as it's manufactured by samsung, even iPhone 13 pro max display looks inferior to this, rear camera is excellent and takes very bright and sharp pics at low light, selfie is average so I downloaded gcam it takes excellent selfies, super fast charging, charge take a bath and comeback you see 100℅. Battery backup is very good when in WiFi and FHD, it's average when in QHD and in mobile data. Excellent design and gorgeous curves, and oozes premiumness, Haptic engine is great, flagship processor and Ram so buttery smooth also 120hz takes it to next level, MIUI13 is clean here and no adds and works like a charm, in simple everything is maxed out. you get true flagship experience similar to S22 ultra.####[['display design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['memory quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Overall it's a good quality phone. The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil/moisture all over the box. But i guess it didn't affect the phone. I have been using it for over a week. The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it. Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note. My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps, and i send it over WhatsApp...the video gets compressed so much that it's laggy and unwatchable. Overall ..I'm happy with the product####[['phone general', 'positive']]
Full satisfied with no compromises with this product. All rounder curved QHD+ Display with LTPO technology as well as smoothness just wow. Cameras are just awesome not as other phones like a cameras count. Triple cameras which is really worth. Primary, Ultra wide and mainly Telephoto triple 50MP as well as 32MP selfie. Charging speed really awesome but battery is average. Because for a day am charging twice. Sound quality this time am totally impressed. In one word with this price a Premium Flagship phone for worth buy.####[['display general', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['hardware quality', 'positive']]
This phone has very good screen, speakers are not very loud but quality is good, phone is slim and body is slippery, phone is buttery smooth and fast, camera is good, but phone gets little warm while using, battery life is average but if you will put ultra battery saver is on while not in use then battery can be perform above average,fingerprint scanner is accurate and fast, overall phone is excellent and a allround package.####[['hardware quality', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['hardware operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is great with beautiful display great inhand feel great haptics. But the battery life in my 4 day usage is average. I don't know if this will be fixed via updates or not but till now it's not very good. I had a 4000 mah phone last and it lasted thr same as this maybe it's because of the processor or thr refresh rate but it should be improved via updates. Other than that the phone's really great and if you are an average user the battery will last the whole day easily so not so bad either. I don't use cameras that much so can't really comment on that but so far looks really good and the limited photos I have clicked have come out great. The couture blue color I bought looks premium and classy too but if you have the option go for the mauve one.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral']]
It feels really good in hand.Fingerprint reader is a little slower than other phones... There is no fog issue till now... Battery life is quite good but the charging speed is really amazing. It took 20 min to charge from 5%-100...gaming experience is good too. Speakers are really good too. Getting a good screen guard and back cover is really hard.####[['hardware operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive']]
Overall its an awesome phone, good camera, awesome display and overall design but the let down is the battery life...lasts only 4-5 hours with decent use..so basically you'll have to charge it twice in a day. The other issue is heating...i know 8 gen 1 is known for heating but this phone heats even on using lighter apps like teams, insta . Xiaomi better provide some updates to improve all the mentioned issues and I've received no updates so far even security patch is of march...this phone is Xiaomi's flagship, so I request them to treat it like one with frequent updates.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative']]
I bought the cream version and it looks very premium. Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k. But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake. Coming to phone, the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT /17 hrs in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel, chrome, and social media apps. Dont play games , so dont know the performance. But its buttery smooth .Outdoor brightness is exceptional. It is joy to watch videos on this on display. Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording . Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option, 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5% to 1% within like 5 mins.####[['platform prices', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'negative']]
Camera too good. Display is dope af. Feels super nice to hold. Flagship experience all around. One small con is the camera arrangement, one below the other, hand touches the cam sometimes, will get used to it in a few days, plus and ultra won't have this issue because the size is bigger I guess. Battery is just decent but still way better than s22.  Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low, even in the morning. Could use night mode to get better pictures. Relies a lot on post processing of the image. Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on. Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better. In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing. 4k 60fps videos are too fiire, screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images. Ton of detail. Stabilization is excellent. Slo mo is fun too.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'neutral'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'positive'], ['display operation_performance', 'positive']]
Excellent overall Phone. All day battery life unless you are a Gamer. Good quality speakers with Dolby Atmos Samsung Samoled screen unbeatable in terms of screen. Great build quality. One UI - it's amazing. Handle tons of apps like a breeze - me being a power user couldn't slow it down even after keeping almost 30 apps running in background. 45W Samsung charger - The cherry on the top, charges entire phone in 1hr some mins.

I liked almost every aspecf of this phone. It is premium,easy to hold considering the screen size ,reminds me of iPhone 5s but that was smaller. Slick, swift and perfectly configured. I might say that this phone looks even better than some of the iPhonesin the market (of course those are way more premium and well put together). I think Samsung got jt all right this time as the elegant flat back and a very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera and refresh rates and the chip..display and camera have been the forte but they went one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality .####[['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
After around 4.5 years of extensive one plus 6T usage, finally I decided go for a new phone and did a pre-booking of Samsung s23 ultra.Here I am writing this review with no regrets on my decision ever. Very happy with the one UI experience, super smooth OS and performance, extensive battery life ,unbeatable camera quality, Display and gaming experience. Just go for it guys if you don't have a budget barrier.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
Writing this review after 1 month of using this device. Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.####[['phone quality', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
I bought it a week ago.. i upgraded from my oneplus 6, I used that phone for 4.5 yrs. I was confused between oneplus 11 and samsung 23, after thoroughly going through reviews from experts. I zeroed on this phone,.. I like the phone no doubt. The haptics are nice and UI is smooth. But i dont know why i m facing connectivity issues in this phone. Being a flagship phone, it should have better connectivity.. but it sucks..websites do not open, both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug. I am unable to use internet, i have to constantly refresh and restart my device for better network. I am getting missed calls alerts via sms although mobile network shows full strength..I think samsung should look into this. its very irritating. Never faced this issue in my 4.5 yrs old oneplus 6.####[['phone connectivity', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
Been using for more than a month, earlier was using S20FE so the data switch and replication of my settings were smooth and easy. I was worried about battery but with dual Sim in use and 4hrs of screen on time I'm getting a descent backup. Idle drain is very low compared to my S20Fe. I'm not pro in camera and pictures captured are impeccable. Device looks premium compactable in hand and is light weight in pocket.####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is good, camera has a satisfactory quality. However it lacks in basic features likes app lock and hide apps. Yes this phone doesn't have inbuilt app lock or hide apps as other phones have. Newly this phone had a good charging speed. However after like 9 months (i bought this phone in April2022) and now I'm facing a Little issues with charging speed. Games and all work good on it. Over its a satisfactory phone####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive']]
It's an good mid-range phone for the price. Display and screen size is good. Battery back up with medium use lasts a day easily. Camera is okay in daylight but in night time shots it struggles. Sound is okay for calls and audio volume for media is not too loud. It's not fast charging phone, takes nearly 3 hrs for a full charge. And switching between SIMs for data connectivity is a pain, no option in the quick menu for this. Overall it's okay.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['display design_features', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
Quick charge by no means charges quickly. It is so sad that i bought this phone thinking it will be a new age phone in charging, but it takes 2.5 hours to fully charge. False claim by company & now it seems I'm helpless. i bought charging adapter from Amazon to suit the phone but yet or charges slowly. I tried it with charging adaptor of One+ yet it doesn't charge quickly. This is annoying####[['battery charging', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative']]

I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother. I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon. Believe me it fabulous product so far. The screen is apt and very clear. Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc. Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material. Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space. Phone is quite light weight and very smart. I chose blue color and believe me it looks classy. Only issue it does not come with earphones I respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but I recommend this to all buyers. In nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too.

The product is looking great, better than its photos available online. I have purchased this item because of its light weight (145gm) sleek design and impact processor within budget. It has no fingerprint lock but the face recognize lock system is great even in the low light. Camera and display both are ok recommend for daily rough use. If you have some extra budget then I also recommend you to buy Redmi 5 or Redmi 7. Redmi 6a is great for me because I use mobile 16hrs a day surfing google and its weight and design is absolutely perfect for me within low budget. However, almost every Android phone is ok for the fist 1.5-2years, afterthat you know what will happen to it.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive']]
Redmi 6A will be the best pick in the budget range. Other competitors can't give the features and quality which Redmi can give you at your hand and in a cheapest range. The best features of this phone is, its traditional looks and features. Battery life is also long lasting. So no doubt, you can go for it. I just have one issue with the packaging of the product by amazon. They have sent a plactic packet, I was shocked! But no damage or physical harm have occured. I am happy with my new device! Thanks Redmi, for giving us an oppurtunity to ascend to a new smartphone in an affordable price range.

I gifted this phone to my Mom, and she is happy. Phone size and shape is good. Camera is okay, don't expect pictures same or like as DSLR. Face recognition is awesome. My Mom is using it for video call with me so I found its front camera is also good. Battery life is also good so i have no complains. You can buy this phone as per your requirement.

Redmi 6a is good product. But 2gb ram is less for smooth functioning. Picture and sound quality is best but battery is average. It's only 6-7 hours battery life if you charge fully then. You get MIUI 10 in redmi 6a. In camera you got portrait mode for selfies. Rear camera quality is too good. But it's work on mediatek this is it's minus point. Screen 5.5 inches.

Its a great product by xiaomi. It's affordable and durable. I have been using this product since last 3 years or more and it is still working. The camera is not upto the mark because it gives a bit blured pics in more light but overall the phone has all the features. The only feature I miss is the fingerprint. But compared to the pricing, this phone has pretty much every essential things.####[['company general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Redmi has not worked on their camera for low light, hence picture quality at night stays poor. But picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price, the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well. It lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once. But I usually can play games seamlessly. The sound outlet is at the back. That is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed, it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones. Sound is okay, not very loud. Just fine and doable. Battery life could have been better, but if you're not online all day or playing video games for hours, changing once a day is more than enough. Biggest problem I've faced is that the hotspot of this phone doesn't always work on my laptop. My laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots. All over, it's a good looking phone with sufficient qualities for this price point.####[['camera general', 'neutral'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Love the phone. Everything on it works as expected. I've been using this phone for about 1 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown: The quality, fit and finish are amazing. No one believes this is low priced phone. Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far. Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models. Camera: not as good as my Honor 7C, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral']]
The phone feels good in hand and quite handy compared to 18:9 phones. The battery backup is really good and lasts easily a day with light to normal usage. Screen is good and maybe best for price segment. Speakers are adequately loud but not that loud. Easily handled 1-3 apps at a time. And the camera is awesome with portrait mode only in FRONT camera. I have attached a image with with HDR on and other zoomed part of same image for image quality and idea about it. Gaming isn't expected for this phone and I don't judge it on gaming basis. No lag issue people just fill the phone will lot of apps and complain about lag which seems stupid. Minor lags are possible as RAM is 2gb. You get Oreo out of box and with miui 9.6 and 8-9 gb ROM available and Miui 10 update is available which is quite better features wise but has minor lags compared to Miui 9.6.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'neutral'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
Let me start off by telling you what this phone is not good at. Gaming. Games like PUBG and similar intensive games will lag inevitably. But the best thing about this phone is that this is the only negative about this device. Day to day performance is fine, call quality is great, camera is doable, battery life is amazing and even the build quality is not bad. At this price point, this phone provides a very satisfactory and pleasing experience. Sure it's not as good as more expensive phones, but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be the phone for everyone, which can do everything an average user would expect. Must buy if you're looking to buy a smartphone at this price point.####[['phone connectivity', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'neutral'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Hello to everyone, I have bought this phone on 3rd December 2018. I want a phone which is easy to hold, easy to use and also cheap in price. I also have a confusing if getting a brst mobile in cheap price, I have searched many times in the youtubr and the other sources then I git this mobile phone. I get impresses by its face lock features. My Father has redmi note 3 which has fingerprint lock system but the problem is that system do nit work if out hands are wet or any thing is puy on our hand. Facr lock is easy and best method to unlock any device easily. I have the problem with its speed. This mobile has also the great disadvantage of getting hanged many times and also need to improve its speed. Many softwares fo not work with it fully so we have to make yhis sure to choose the right software for this mobile phone. Overall I like this mobile system, its look and many more.####[['software general', 'neutral'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
After 1 year use:- Memory is less needed some more (but it's quality is good) Powerful - Camera, LED light, Sound Waste - Screen Light , heating while playing games for more than 40 minutes. This phone fell on Floor 6-7 times, Never faced any issues regarding lag, used it's processor quite roughly but it sustained that stress too. So I can say it's value for money .

The phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c1 adding 1000 buck don't buy it for the user's who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people BUT IF YOU ARE GAMER DONT BUY IT REALLY SUCKS !!! go for real me C1 it's will give u decent performance in this price range####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone quality', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'neutral']]
I bought this a gift to my mom who doesn't use mobile other than for watching videos. I liked the lowest price point offering but the volume is really low. we end up using headphones. it is so annoying to use that it almost made the phone unusable. I understand that the low cost phone doesn't have to offer many features but volume which is very basic feature, this device miserably failed in delivering it. so i recommend for the price point but beware of the volume issue.####[['phone price', 'neutral'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative']]
I have purchased this product for my mom as she only used this mobile for calling and still this product get heated up quickly. Camera Quality is not upto the mark. If you are purchasing for streaming videos, whatsapp and other social networking purpose. Recommend not to buy, there are many other phone to buy in this or may be 1000/- to 1500/- additional range.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
It's my bad that even though I read about this phone having issues like hanging etc I went for it just because as price factor as I would be using this as secondary phone. But complete dissatisfaction. Phone hangs even just with one app WhatsApp. Battery even though its 100% comes down to less than 20% in 4-5 hours (Yes with out Data, GPS enabled). I tried returning this phone and its pathetic that Amazon straightly said they cant return I seriously felt very unhappy with their response on phone, calling agent started giving me gyaan about settings I said I already did more that what she said, so last final answer is I cant return the phone so waste of money. So now 6K under the drain Amazon doesn't care once its sold (its not a offer sale). Thanks Amazon you surpassed Flipkart in cheating customers. Kudos!####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['platform general', 'negative'], ['platform prices', 'negative']]
Fantastic product in terms of body, looks, battery etc. The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life. Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern; especially more observed when dual space is enabled. Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads. Go for a Google search of "Phone Has been locked, Try Again in 119 minutes" and verify yourself. Its all about the bug in several of the mi product, and personally faced many times. Imagine you have to call a Uber or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message. Other issue is heating, which is prominent in hot weather. Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer. Otherwise phone is good in this budget.####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
This product is a very mediocre product. You can't even play 60 FPS videos in the youtube app. In short, if you want to do only phone and messaging with this app, you'll be fine. For everything else, this phone sucks. Picture quality of camera is decent, not very good. The screen quality sucks. Performance of the phone sucks too. Have 4 or more apps open and the phone will start stuttering heavily. All background apps will have to be force closed to get an optimal performance.####[['phone general', 'neutral'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['display quality', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative']]
The phone is not up to the mark.. As I have seen all the rating and all... And i thought I will get a good deal but seriously this phone is waste of money... And software problem and app stops in between and many other problems its better is add more money and buy good phone. Storage is very much low after having memory card still i face same issue... I advise you to add more money and go for good fon####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['storage general', 'negative']]
Sound Quality is very poor as even on high volume the phone’s ringtone is very audible. The only reason why I bought this phone was due to MI’s reputation of good battery performance which failed to deliver as even after the phone usage is hardly for an hour, it requires charging the next day as well & for the battery to be fully charged, it takes too long. No Value for Money even though it’s being sold for cheap####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Sound quality is very poor, the phone found to hang within one year. Battery life is not satisfactory. For hanging all the social media apps like whatsapp, facebook etc uninstalled from phone hanging problem reduced but existed. Some times external Wifi was found to not working with the phone after one year to overcome I have to reset the phone many times. Moreover the overall performance is not satisfactory.####[['hardware quality', 'negative'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative']]
I have been using Redmi 4A which I bouhght a year back in the similar kind of sale at same price which is far better in color contrast and other specification. Visual images showing in the promotions interms of sleek design and depth absolutely wrong as its depth looks normal. Especially for the 4A users, it looks quiet low graded model. Increased the length of the mobile but width seems to be not matching up. Font and icon names like Gallery,,etc doesn't look that clear to read properly. Totally compared with Redmi 4A, it is a big failure and I won't even suggest anyone to spend 6000 rs for this mobile. I took lot of time to consider chinese phone, but they proved once agian that their products are worst. One biggest disadvantage is half of the memory of 16 GB will be used for internal apps of MI.####[['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative']]
Worst phone. Hangs a lot. Very slow and sluggish compared to realme c1 and redmi 5a or even redmi 2 prime! Photo quality also worst front facing camera. Processor is very far behind in real life usage compared to snapdragon 450 in realme c1. Can't play pubg even in low quality as it hangs. Display is also not so large compared to realme c1. Please by honor or realme c1 or asus zenfone max pro m1 instead of this. They said after I purchased that I cannot return product for phones. So got my money wasted so please don't purchase. Display is also poor when watching video at start then recovers slowly. In general not a worthy phone at all by Xiaomi! It has become money minded.####[['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'negative'], ['display design_features', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['company general', 'negative'], ['company price', 'negative']]
Camera is very poor 13mp camera quality shows but when we take pictures quality is 5mp camera like that. When phone is released mi6a 9000rs at the time phone quality is OK. But 5500rs same mi6a phone quality is very poor. When phone rate is high phone quality is a good. And phone rate is low phone quality also poor. My suggestion is when phone comes to market phone price is high please buy that time only. Not a price drop time.####[['camera general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['phone quality', 'negative']]
It has an absolutely stunning design with BMW Racing Lines. I loved the look of it. In Call of Duty, 8 Gen 2 Processor makes sure there is zero lag and super smooth game I can play. Movies and Videos seem really realistic in this as the brightness of display is so high and best part it even with all this my Battery would easily last more than 1.5 Days without Charging. Even when I compared with OnePlus 11 features, the specs of iQOO 11 seemed way better. True Value for Money at this Price Point####[['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive']]
I sold my iphone 12 for this phone i was bit scare at the first but after playing games for long hours with screen recording does not heat this phone this made me think that i made the right choice at all my iphone was lagging so much but this phone is awesome.SD 8 GEN 2 is beast and runs without any heat for long time. I watched a lot videos about cons of the os skin given with iqoo phone but i am surprised it is clean and have every functional apps preinstalled.####[['phone usability', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive']]
A very great product launched by Tecno Mobiles Tecno Spark 9 in a very budgeted price with very great and exclusive features in this price segment I’m really very impressed by it’s attractive design and the camera of this smartphone also giving a very impressive pics by providing true colors and also very exciting feature of Ram fusion by using this feature it extends my ram upto 3gb and makes my experience smoother.####[['company general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'positive'], ['memory design_features', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'positive']]
For sure that this device is 'value for money'. But the specs are not of any use, it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range, but its of no use as graphics, screen refresh rate are not compatible, hence he ram is just kind of waste here. Camera quality is also poor, yes it's not upto the mark. You can avail this phone for normal use, but camera needs to be better. As its camera is also not upto mark, this device is not compatible to most people. It's a good low budget phone, but instead of RAM, the focus should have been on camera and screen refresh rate.####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['phone design_features', 'negative'], ['memory design_features', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['display operation_performance', 'negative'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I bought this mobile on 7th september and it got bad the next day after delivery the problem was automatic restart. Restarting automatically four to five times a day , After a lot of hard work and thrice the Amazon technician came, it got replaced but the problem is still the same, now it restarts only twice. I wanted to give it a star but it has so many features which you will not get in any other mobile and the camera is just below average, I will not recommend this mobile to anyone, so buy it at your own risk. This is the real review.####[['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative']]
I am writing this after more than a month of use....battery charging time is worst for this price range smartphones...alarm never gets turned on (it always shows sound was low so alarm didn't turned up)..,...and also it has lacking hardware support....hotspot was getting connected but it was showing device has no internet....although internet was working fine in the device......so I have to do factory reset to resolve the issue......and yes the most worst part ....the phone gets restarted automatically...whether u r in a call or surfing or whatever u do....and I am facing this issue right after a week of purchase...  So concluding to the issues I am facing....I am very disappointed that I just wasted my money for this shit of piece....  So I would suggest .,.....please go for realme(not a promotion, it's because I am using it...way better than techno 9 for this price range )..if u wanna use your phone for long...####[['battery charging', 'positive'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'negative'], ['phone price', 'negative']]
Excellent Camera in a mobile phone..Shutter speed is like a DSLR camera..All moving subjects has been shooted without any blur... Really impressed..I don't see any issues with MIUI 14..Intially for the two days..phone is much warmer than expected but after that it's stabilized.SD 8 GEN 2 not optimised like other flagship devices in the market.Xiaomi needs to optimise the software with Hardware..other than that no complaints.. Awesome camera phone..I returned S23 ultra and bought this mobile..still it's a beast..Guys trust me..You can purchase this mobile without any second thoughts!!...A good start from Xiaomi and it's a game changer!!!...####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['hardware general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive']]
Camera is the main highlight of this phone. Practically primary and telephoto camera is very good , ultra wide not so .. SD 8 GEN 2 does its job to run the phone in 2k 120hz mode smoothly without any frame drops in the UI , opening and closing multiple apps, playing games etc. My only complaint will be MIUI though its very refined version still the updates are not that fast (India Rom). Also promised to get 3Yrs of Android + 5Yrs of security updates. In my opinion it should be in line with the Oneplus or Samsung flagships (4+5). Other than that its a proper flagship experience . Lets see what it holds in the future.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive']]
I bought it mainly for the camera and it doesn't disappoint there but there are things which not good and which my 5 years old op6 did better, way better infact . The signal catching power is way too low be it wifi or sim(Airtel and Jio). Screen doesn't feel as good as my Nexus 3 felt. There's lots of small time glitches which I don't know if software updates will correct. Bought it for wireless charging but 50w compatible wireless is still not launched in India. Wooosh .... The charger is good and camera... Oh it's very good. I would have given it 4 stars but I was on a OnePlus 6 and it feels like a downgrade most of the times####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['phone connectivity', 'negative'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['software general', 'negative'], ['battery charging', 'neutral']]
I shift to lava Agni 5G from poco X2 because I need privacy poco sending my data to china and I don't want it I compared both phones camera poco have good selfie but lava back 64MP kicks off poco. battery life much better on lava it's easily give me 10hr battery life on heavy use thanks to stock Android where poco screen on was 5.5hr .performance little better on lava . Lava has good display showing pure white colour where poco is warm . Lava did a excellent job very appreciable thank you lava####[['battery general', 'positive'], ['os general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['display general', 'positive'], ['company general', 'positive']]
I bought this phone on 22nd may '22. Here I like to share that there is no gallery and regular music apps in this phone. Pics we get from Google photos only. We need to download those apps. And I have given 3 star for picture bcz automatically it's taking dim pics though sun light exists and we take it from shadow. For a while brightness occurs but not every time. rest all good.we can excuse these minor things as Google photos also have every feature and can download music app and can go ahead for this phone. Let's support Indian branded ones. Jai hind!####[['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
After 2 months of use.....phone is absolutely stunning in performance,display build quality and does not get warm on charging or heavy gaming. Camera performance is really good with back camera ....front camera is ok if we compare with back camera....  It takes hardly 15 min to charge from 30% to 100%.... Battery backup is good...  Overall an awesome device....better than samsung in 35k price range####[['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'neutral'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive']]
I bought it for 24.5k. I was using Poco F1 from past 5 years and it was great, when compared to this smartphone.  Realme UI3 process is not that great. There is no much features or play around in the settings.  Camera detailing is not great at this price point. Don't feel like sony camera is used here. Front camera is worst. 50MP camera is for back n not self and the is just of the phone.  Phone gets heated little.  Processer is great but Ram management is not that great.####[['software general', 'negative'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['phone usability', 'neutral'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'negative']]
This phone really awesome with camera, display, haptic, battery, performance.

Powerful and great device got at descent price.  If you are a performance lover this is great for you , not good for photography but Not that bad camera..Gives good picture though. Value for Money dnf 3 tears os updates and 4 years security updates with this.####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
Battery performance is very poor, very worst battery backup I have ever seen. I am a normal user , even after that it's charging twice in a day. But the charging speed is very good. The front camera is also not good at this price point, it's below average. Back camera performance is good.####[['battery general', 'negative'], ['camera operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative']]
If we talk about performance then it is good,no lagging but front camera and wide angle camera is really worst. It should be at least 32 MP front and 50MP wide angle.They have not provided headphone jack.This phone is good for performance and gaming. If u want to buy over all camera and performance then go for gt 2 pro.####[['phone operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'negative'], ['hardware design_features', 'negative']]
I have been using this for 2 days. I liked the camera and display so much. Realme ui is so nice. Charging speed is good. Battery backup is good as well.    I have not faced any heating issue until now and have very smooth experience thanks to snapdragon 888.    Only con I have seen is the ram management but for average user it is not a problem.    I would say overall balanced phone with customization ui with great camera. I am loving it.####[['software general', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['phone usability', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['memory general', 'negative'], ['phone general', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive']]
Phone is awesome I bought the phone in 27k with this smartphone comes with the Snapdragon 888 which is very powerful and the device is fully optimised  Battery backup is good nearly 8 hours screen on time with normal usage. Camera with OIS is a big advantage in this price range. If your budget is 30 k go for it without any hesitation. The other phone in this price range is iQOO 9 SE but the phone comes with the funtouch OS which makes that phone very bad####[['phone general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['cpu general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['phone price', 'neutral']]
It contains the beast SD 888 which allows you to perform tremendously through long period usage. The Sony IMX766 sensor clarifies the pics and videos to the utmost. This phone also has a feature of recording in 4k 60 fps, thus you won't face any troubles while shooting vlogs. The speed of charging is pretty much sufficient,though battery backup could be better.  The best color amongst these three is the paper green which looks even more fascinating with the designer's signature.####[['cpu general', 'positive'], ['cpu operation_performance', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['battery charging', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative']]
Value for money Wala Flagship,I really liked its Camera performance....50MP primary sensor is killer....Night mode & starry mode also too good....  But only disadvantage in this Flagship killer,that is it's battery backup not up to the mark..but no too much battery drained... it's batterybackup is 7-8 hours Screen on time..Realme please optimised this issue ASAP. I feel heating issue on it.... Basically SDM888 heating issue is normal....but it's cooling technology is good!  Suggested this mobile####[['phone price', 'positive'], ['camera design_features', 'positive'], ['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'negative'], ['phone design_features', 'positive']]
Changing my review after couple of months, camera and battery is good. But display is hdr10+ but still no update for 4k in Netflix and other ott app, this can be done by update. Also average brightness is very low but it go upto 1300 nits Realme is doing good but in terms of update or quick solutions it's very weak Performance is good but not much as we expect from sd 888. this also can be updated by ui update.####[['camera general', 'positive'], ['battery general', 'positive'], ['display general', 'negative'], ['phone operation_performance', 'negative'], ['cpu general', 'neutral']]
