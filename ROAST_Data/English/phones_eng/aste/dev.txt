Battery drains too fast on the running of location services and the battery last around 8 to 9 hours while using location services continuously . The PPI should have to more as compared to previous smartphone . The brightness is very low as mentioned by the realme .

If you are confused between iqoo 9se and realme GT2 . I can say that just buy realme , it is full of features , customization and it ' s look is super . I must say if you want a balanced phone in every term , you should look to this phone .  BUT BUT BUT  There is a major problem which is Direct video call from google dailer .

Fantastic mobile in all means . This is the best Android in market without doubt and I feel this is far better than latest iPhone in terms of quality and features .  Noted my observations after 2 weeks of usage .    But think twice before buying this from Flipkart . Such a pathetic service . I bought this phone in exchange of my S20 Fe 5g . My mobile was in flawless condition and the exchange amount was 22k . But during inspection they told it has a scratch on side and 3k will be deducted . It was just a very minor line on the side and because of that they deducted 3000Rs . Absolutely ridiculous .

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE . It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user ' s finger doesn ' t slide smoothly .  The software is very very poor .

The phone doesn ' t allow user to do even basic settings like adjusting touch sensitivity . The user has to try multiple times to slide down the notification panel . These drawbacks are not due to any physical defects but due to very poor software and hardware design . The user can do only a few settings compared to other phones .

Seller MyThanGlory retail is excellent. Sending brand new Jan 23 make model, delivered in a sealed pack. One can trust this seller blindfolded.  Also note that Samsung does not make F13 model by itself, this has been outsourced to Dixon technology (manufacturer) and distributed by Samsung India.####[]
Back / rear camera is good , but front camera quality is not good . Mobile is doing disturbance when I had switched it on after unboxing , from that time also it ' s doing slow work .

Decent purchase within the budget . Camera is satisfactory . Camera quality is the same when compared to Redmi 11T 5G which costs 16k . So comparetively it is a goof purchase in 12k .

I ' ve been using it for a week now . And it did heat a lot in first 2days of use . But now this doesn ' t happen anymore .  Battery is not upto the mark but I ' m an average user so it lasts a day for me .

Camera is amazing and crisp . Colours are close to accurate . It misses telephoto lens which can be understood because of its design .

At first hands - on , looks like a pretty solid phone considering the form factor . The obvious tradeoff is the battery life , I ' m getting around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi always on and no sim card . Apart from that the only other issue I feel is that the hinge and folding mechanism is slightly weaker than the Flip 4 as I have used the Flip 4 in Samsung cafe stores and they seem tougher than the Flip 3 .####[['battery life', 'around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi', 'negative'], ['phone', 'folding mechanism is slightly weaker', 'negative']]

after 3 months of usage .  Better wait for Realme 10 pro + which will be at 20 to 25 segment    Apart from display phone is average . . . . . for curved display this is the only phone with value under this range .  Some software bugs are there with banking apps .  Speaker is obsolete rubbish . . . . no Dolby , single mono speaker which is of average quality .  For 1st 10 days as I noticed battery is draining fast .  Sim signals are perfect , as previously used oppo Reno 6 5G I only get 2 or 3 points at home but for this I get complete signal almost every time .

Over all look and feel it ' s good , if anyone wants to have mobile for normal usage and they can live without curved screen , then I suggest not to go with this .

Overall wonderful mobile . But it heats up a little during normal operation . Battery backup is very good . Camera is not upto the mark as per price standard .

The phone is overall good .  Few things i noted in first 3 days of use :  1 ) battery lasts for an entire day with medium usage .  2 ) speaker output is good and loud .  3 ) still have vivo apps such as - v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled . This should be removed from flagships atleast .  4 ) display is awsome , but LTPO would have been better given the price .  5 ) havent tried heavy gaming , but processor seems capable .  6 ) camera performance is good , but in my old phone i have been using GCAM , so compared to that the stock camera smoothens skin in portrait mode , which i am not a big fan of .  7 ) getting a weird bug , i have JBL Flip 6 , and when its connected , Absolute volume control is not available for some reason . This might be a software bug , but needs to be fixed .####[['phone', 'overall good', 'positive'], ['battery', 'asts for an entire day with medium usage', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'loud', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'output is good', 'positive'], ['apps', 'v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled', 'negative'], ['display', 'awsome', 'positive'], ['processor', 'seems capable', 'positive'], ['camera', 'performance is good', 'positive'], ['software bug', 'weird bug', 'negative'], ['software bug', 'Absolute volume control is not available', 'negative']]

My first Vivo phone and surely my last one . The display , though AMOLED , comes nowhere near SAMSUNG sAMOLED . The design is prehistoric , especially with the back dated thick bezels . It makes the device cheap looking . Only a colorful back never makes an attractive phone . Battery drains too fast . Charging speed is satisfactory though . The only redeeming feature is the camera quality of the phone . Would suggest not to waste money on it , rather go for some other mobile .####[['display', 'back dated thick bezels', 'negative'], ['phone', 'design is prehistoric', 'negative'], ['phone', 'cheap looking', 'negative'], ['phone', 'colorful back never makes an attractive', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'Charging speed is satisfactory', 'neutral'], ['Battery', 'drains too fast', 'negative'], ['phone', 'not to waste money', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'redeeming', 'positive']]
