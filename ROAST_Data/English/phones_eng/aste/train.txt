I needed a phone with buttery smooth performance with excellent power efficiency and a good battery life and I got it . Camera wasn ' t my concern as its camera is good enough for my purposes . And it has the best LCD screen I ' ve ever seen . And the sound is also good . With the 8 / 256 combo , I probably won ' t be having a need to replace it for the next 5 years . Also , love the phantom blue color . Dimensity 8100 is no joke . I am yet to experience heating outside of gaming . Even during gaming , the phone only gets warm and there ' s no throttling . The performance remains consistent even after several hours of gaming .####[['phone', 'buttery smooth performance', 'positive'], ['phone', 'excellent power efficiency', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'good', 'positive'], ['camera', 'good enough', 'positive'], ['LCD screen', 'best', 'positive'], ['phone', 'sound is also good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'love the phantom blue color', 'positive'], ['Dimensity 8100', 'no joke', 'positive'], ['phone', 'yet to experience heating outside of gaming', 'positive'], ['phone', 'performance remains consistent', 'positive']]
Bought this almost a month ago , Got it for 15250 / - with exchange and cards . And I am absolutely satisfied with this phone . It is undoubtedly most powerful phone in this range . Camera is decent ( not the best ) . Beast performance and 3 . 5 mm jack available so its best for those who do gaming . Other day to day tasks run smoothly . Some bugs are in OS which can be fixed with updates . Screen is LCD but its good quality LCD with 144 hz refresh rate so it is overall decent although Amoled with 120 hz could have been better . Audio is good with dual stereo speakers present . Fingerprint sensor is quick . Battery backup is good and 67W charging is also fast enough . I am a heavy user and even for me it gives backup for whole day so Battery is overall very good . 4 . 5 / 5 phone . If performance matters for You . If camera is more important to you go for Realme 9 pro + 5g .####[['phone', 'absolutely satisfied', 'positive'], ['phone', 'most powerful phone in this range', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'decent', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'not the best', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'Beast performance', 'positive'], ['phone', '3 . 5 mm jack available', 'positive'], ['phone', 'best for those who do gaming', 'positive'], ['OS', 'Some bugs', 'negative'], ['Screen', 'LCD', 'neutral'], ['Screen', 'good quality', 'positive'], ['Screen', '144 hz refresh rate', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Audio is good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'dual stereo speakers present', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint sensor', 'quick', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'good', 'positive'], ['67W charging', 'fast enough', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'gives backup for whole day', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'overall very good', 'positive'], ['phone', '4 . 5 / 5', 'positive']]
Great Battery , Superb Performance , I mainly bought this phone for performance . No lag in PUBG , APEX LEGENDS , MLBB . As this is my primary phone now i use a lot of battery but still it runs smoothly for a day with a lot of battery to spare . I binge watch Netflix , Prime , Hotstar for 2 - 3 hours so battery is very good according to me . A lot of people are complaining about the camera but I don ' t get it , I am not very focused on camera but it gives decent pictures . Back main camera is more than enough for good photography , the front camera is not upto the mark that ' s true . The feel is not much premium because of the plastic back but you won ' t feel it . The screen is not AMOLED but I used to have super AMOLED and this screen is doing more than fine for me . I am ok with it .

Using it for one month , good budget phone after exchange . Good for playing games and day to day uses , good battery life fast charge is awesome . Bought it for its processor thinking that all phone nowdays have storage expansion by SD card , none of the review had talked about no storage with SD card , so disappointed when I unboxed . Camera is average , back vibration with full volume . Just after setting up it updated to Android 13 with latest security patchs , good for day to dayuses and great for gaming , no heating observed till now . Full charge in 55min . Hoping to get some software updates to tune camera for optimal performance .####[['phone', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'budget', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Good for playing games and day to day uses', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'good', 'positive'], ['fast charge', 'awesome', 'positive'], ['processor', 'NULL', 'positive'], ['phone', 'no storage with SD card', 'negative'], ['phone', 'disappointed', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'average', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'back vibration with full volume', 'negative'], ['phone', 'updated to Android 13', 'positive'], ['phone', 'good for day to dayuses', 'positive'], ['phone', 'great for gaming', 'positive'], ['phone', 'no heating observed', 'positive'], ['fast charge', 'Full charge in 55min', 'positive']]
The K50i is an excellent choice for those in the market for a smartphone under 25 , 000 rupees . Although its single - core performance is not as strong as the Snapdragon 870 but it compensates with fast multi - core performance . The camera is adequate , but not exceptional . With 12 5G bands , it offers comprehensive coverage of all 5G bands in India . The display is an IPS LCD screen , which is not as efficient with battery usage or color display as an AMOLED screen . The battery performance is satisfactory , but not outstanding . On the positive side , the phone charges quickly , taking just 40 minutes to go from 15 % to 85 % . The 144Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth user experience .####[['K50i', 'excellent choice', 'positive'], ['K50i', 'single - core performance is not as strong', 'negative'], ['K50i', 'compensates with fast multi - core performance', 'positive'], ['camera', 'adequate', 'positive'], ['camera', 'not exceptional', 'neutral'], ['K50i', 'comprehensive coverage of all 5G bands', 'positive'], ['display', 'IPS LCD screen', 'negative'], ['display', 'not as efficient', 'negative'], ['battery', 'performance is satisfactory', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'not outstanding', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'charges quickly', 'positive'], ['display', '144Hz refresh rate', 'positive'], ['K50i', 'smooth user experience', 'positive']]
Overall the phone is good interms of performance and the fast charging . . I am writing this review after using it for 1month . . the isuue with phone is sometimes the application doesn ' t open at all . . And sometimes after opening anything app . Your touch doesn ' t work and says app isn ' t working .

I regret buying this device to be honest . Rear camera is average , front camera is below average ( photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better ) . Battery drains a lot even if you are not using the device , feels like 2 - 3k mah battery . Ram mangement is pathetic , can ' t even beat my 4 year old Samsung device with 4 gigs of ram . Device heats a lot when charging or doing normal tasks . The only good thing about this device is the perfomance . This will be my first and last Chinese phone .####[['phone', 'regret buying this device', 'negative'], ['Rear camera', 'average', 'neutral'], ['front camera', 'below average', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'drains a lot', 'negative'], ['phone', 'heats a lot', 'negative'], ['phone', 'good thing about this device is the perfomance', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'feels like 2 - 3k mah', 'negative'], ['Ram mangement', 'pathetic', 'negative']]

Don ' t buy this phone if you ' re looking for gaming . Despite having a powerful processor , it ' s unable to handle most games . RAM management is very bad , so much that even 2 apps wont stay in ram sometimes . Minor heating issues occur and constant lags while gaming . Games stutter randomly and frequently . Sometimes even crash and a message pops up " System UI not responding " . . . UI also has a lot of minor bugs which really degrades the user experience . Not at all recommended for heavy users .####[['processor', 'powerful', 'positive'], ['processor', 'unable to handle most games', 'negative'], ['RAM management', 'very bad', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Minor heating issues', 'negative'], ['phone', 'constant lags while gaming', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Games stutter randomly and frequently', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Sometimes even crash', 'negative'], ['UI', 'lot of minor bugs', 'negative'], ['phone', 'really degrades the user experience', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Not at all recommended for heavy users', 'negative']]
Not a good battery . Since am regular customer in redmi . Am not sure how come this product become worst in terms of battery . just 10days over to this phone and i visited to service center to check on this fault , they said no issue after keeping observation of 1day . But i could see same conditions as before . Now am frustrated on this phone to change this phone , I don ' t have replacement nor to change battery , Redmi has to understand this situation and request to come to me .

Only thing good about this phone is it ' s battery which provides 6 hours of screen on time . Fingerprint sensor is not good , screen goes white most of time during calls . Dimensity 8100 Processor is overhyped not even close to snapdragon 855 . Phone lags most of the time while using . Everything from Speakers & mic to camera & touch are average . MiUi 13 is worst UI . If u are stock Android user then this redmi k50 i is definitely not recommended , lots of ads & bloatware . My 3 years old OnePlus 7 still works way better than redmi k50 i .

I see a lot of experts comment here. They use this platform show their expertise. They compare it with a Nikon DSLR for camera, battery life with a car battery and display with that with a smart tv. Go for any mobile. Just see the features you need. A basic camera, reasonable 4000 to 6000 mAH battery. I have not found any such negativity described here. My mobiles last for more than 2 years irrespective of any brands.####[]

I was able to place a replacement order but the replacement handset also had same problem finally called amazon customer care and raised a return request .

The quality of the power button is very poor . I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023 . When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device ( As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped , hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost . I told them that there was no crack on screen or dent on any other part of the phone and asked them to write in writing that they confirm that the phone was dropped .

Within 2 days , none of them is ready to provide support for replacement with other brand or return of money . For them there is no technical defect so will not support . How can anyone know before buying that the mentiones quality is not upto the mark . WASTE OF MONEY at this cost .

I have used this phone only for 7 days . Both the camera quality is very bad . Front camera pictures are too poor quality . Battery charging is too late , tools more than 2 hours to full charge .

Wifi reception is absolutely poor , infact worst . Apps keeps buffering and loading and you cant use internet over wifi . even whatsapp msg and calls are not working with this .

Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal . Its buttery smooth , no lag what soever , camera is top notch like its top quality . I thought it would take time to get adjust to its OS but for me it was no problem . I thought I would miss many feature from android but tbh most of the androids features are gimmicky and I only ever miss multitasking from android . But then again I am going to a very budget phone so i dont really know the true extent of android flagship phone but then again if you are going to pay premium price for a phone why not a Iphone####[['iphone', 'phenomenal', 'positive'], ['iphone', 'buttery smooth', 'positive'], ['iphone', 'no lag', 'positive'], ['camera', 'top notch', 'positive'], ['camera', 'top quality', 'positive'], ['OS', 'no problem', 'positive'], ['OS', 'miss multitasking', 'negative']]
As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say , iPhone is a good upgrade . I do , however , have some issues with the phone . If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues . As in , the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature . In the case of messages , you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option . Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone . I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls . Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e - sim , no dual tray for both your sim card . I am having issues with screencast / mirroring as well . In short , all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone . Other than that the phone is great . Camera is great with a lot of features ( which I’m still learning ) . Sound is great . No annoying nudges to keep updating apps . It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated . Easy to use once you get the hang of it .####[['iPhone', 'good upgrade', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'some issues', 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'does not have built in call recording feature', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'does not have mark as read option', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'Truecaller absolutely does not work', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'issues with screencast / mirroring', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'great', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'great', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'lot of features', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'great', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'No annoying nudges to keep updating apps', 'positive']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera ( highly impressive video quality ) , battery life ( normal use - more than 10hrs , Gaming - 4 - 5hrs ) , performance ( best ) .

I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately . This phone is perfect for all , whatever you need you can get from this device . Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb . Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7 - 8hrs of backup . Build quality is superb . The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate , Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it , rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate . And guys i love the notch so sorry about it i can ' t comment on this .

It is an amazing phone , the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones , it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6 - 7 hours screen time which is decent ( depending upon how you wanna use your phone , i use mine primarily for work , emailing , googling , watching videos and all ) . The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow , this is my switch from android to ios for the first time , although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great , total value for money ( got it for 62k )####[['phone', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['phone', 'experience is buttery smooth', 'positive'], ['battery', 'slightly let down', 'negative'], ['battery', 'decent', 'positive'], ['camera', 'actually great', 'positive'], ['camera', 'video quality is wow', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'few restrictions in terms of customisation', 'negative'], ['phone', 'great', 'positive'], ['phone', 'total value for money', 'positive']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos , just go for it .

I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed . Literally my decision from shifting android to iPhone was bit worse . I suggest to stick with android only .####[['iPhone', 'almost good', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'bit worst', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'not get a proper internet connection', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'u will get disappointed', 'negative']]
Camera quality is good , front camera quality is very bad ! battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long , but games runs so smoothly ! Screen size is small , face id works perfect , No bugs ! Display quality is best , All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth , but its apple ( we shell not talk about worth of money ) Edited review After using it 2 months - : battery life is good enough I charge it upto 90 % and play on it with wifi and bluetooth connection on it reaches to 30 % after 4 hours so battery is good enough… .

Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement . Android users may find the security annoying . . I did . . . . biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book . Audio ( Stereo ) quality is awesome for a phone . Battery will last 1 day for average users . . . . . jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks ( on Android ) is a bummer . . . . but security is security .

A good phone for which you might need to sell your kidney . Battery life is decent , user interface is same as of Android , camera quality is decent but if I am going to spend 70k on a phone for camera , I better spend it on a DSLR .

I paid 73 , 000 for a phone but they don ' t give a charger ! Thats so cheap about apple . Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste . Good decision . If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger , then why they need to produce new phones in the first place ? To cut down waste and save environment , they can stop producing phone as well , right ? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention .

Thought that at least I phone won’t hang but it’s been only 1 month I bought it and it started hanging already and it’s been 3rd time in a month .

This phone has over 100 megapixel camera 6x zoom and 5000 mah battery but it doesn ' t feel like a OnePlus phone . I used OnePlus Nord for 3 years but the phone never lagged or got stuck even once .

Haven ' t got any complaints overall , good built quality , display is vibrant enough and bright , battery life is on the better side , lasts a while .

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given .

Power and performance wise the device is a beast . However , I noticed very late that phone has light bleeding issue . In dark environment , the bleeding is clearly visible on black wallpaper .

Writing this review after 6 months of purchase . I dropped in water for less than a second . It turned off after that . Now it ' s repair cost is more than it ' s original cost - not covered by warranty . I have had other brands phones which got wet more than once but never got any problem . This was my worst experience . My 28k down to zero just in one second .####[['warranty', 'not covered', 'negative'], ['warranty', "repair cost is more than it ' s original cost", 'negative'], ['NULL', 'worst experience', 'negative']]

For sure that this device is ' value for money ' . But the specs are not of any use , it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range , but its of no use as graphics , screen refresh rate are not compatible , hence he ram is just kind of waste here . Camera quality is also poor , yes it ' s not upto the mark . You can avail this phone for normal use , but camera needs to be better .

This phone is the most unstable one I have ever seen .

As soon as you start the phone it starts to hang . The HiOS sometimes stops working . The RAM is almost consumed upto 60 % when you start the phone for the first time . The refresh rate is hopeless .

There are lots of negative reviews but this phone is overall a good phone .

But it ' s battery backup was 4 times better When compared with M32 . Camera quality was also average . So i replaced it within 10 days i got same m32 - 6 Gb in 20 days .

This phone is decent enough as per its price point , it can be the best mean device for normal usage and for those who don ' t have anything much to do with high fi features .

The phone in itself is very well designed with a proper 3 - slot sim card tray and 4 cameras but the 2 mp macro lens does not produce good photos . The battery life is good and the screen is also quite good . Brightness is adequate and the charging for the phone is also fast . The phone can run cod at ultra but now the limit has been reduced .

Battery drains very fast even Im not a rough user . Camera quality feels much better . Maybe because my previous phone had less camera specs than this one .

The battery life is disappointing . Even with moderate usage , the battery drains quickly and needs to be charged frequently . This can be a major inconvenience for anyone who relies on their phone for work or personal use . The build quality is not as good as previous models . The phone feels flimsy and fragile , and the back cover scratches easily . The fingerprint sensor is also unreliable and often fails to recognize my fingerprint .

Bought it solely because I needed a phone that charges fast and oh boy this phones charges in a flash . The best part they give you the charger .

All the features are average but the battery is the worst , it diffuses on such a pace that it ' s difficult for you to keep this mobile while you are traveling . All though it gets charged instantly that is one of the fastest i have seen till now . But it ' s reversely proportional . The camera quality is average for this price , as you can get better quality in Realme smartphones as well at half the price . Overall i would say i made a mistake purchasing this mobile .####[['mobile', 'All the features are average', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'worst', 'negative'], ['battery', "diffuses on such a pace that it ' s difficult for you to keep this mobile while you are traveling", 'negative'], ['battery', 'gets charged instantly that is one of the fastest i have seen till now', 'positive'], ['camera', 'quality is average for this price', 'neutral'], ['mobile', 'made a mistake purchasing', 'negative']]
Do not buy , I am facing issue , screen automatically turns on during call which effects call in many ways , like phone call button may click automatically due to touch of cheek during call .

Believe me the cameras are useless ! Don’t get biased by seeing many reviews here ( I think most are paid ) . Me myself ordered this phone and had to return this at any cost . I may not take this phone even this costs at 20k .  About speaker quality , let me explain , thankgod I found an issue , and the item got returned . DONT MAKE MISTAKE ! Speakers sounds good and loud too BUT , when you increase the volume , the back of the phone tremendously vibrates and you start feel irritating .  So , If anyone buying this and has a requirement of camera and speaker , you shouldn’t opt this ! Believe me , It won’t solve your minor requirement too ! !####[['cameras', 'useless', 'negative'], ['phone', 'had to return this at any cost', 'negative'], ['speaker quality', 'found an issue', 'negative'], ['Speakers', 'sounds good and loud', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'when you increase the volume , the back of the phone tremendously vibrates', 'negative'], ['phone', 'shouldn’t opt', 'negative'], ['phone', 'won’t solve your minor requirement', 'negative']]
Looks ordinary , feels ordinary , both front and back camera are okayish . I don ' t know why people hyped one plus camera so much . I ' d pay max 12k to 15k for this handset . Plus it ' s huge , feels like you ' ve held a tab in hand . It ' s huge and thick , it has all the thickness for earphone jack but doesn ' t have one . If you ' ve used pixel 4a kinda phones this handset feels like garbage in hand . It is only good to binge Netflix due to good battery back up and huge screen . Not buying one plus ever again .

This phone could have been 10 % cheaper than the current price . However overall a good package to go for where you get all S20 feature in a phone except a space zoom . Which i dont feel as a necessary feature . Also slight heating issue and Charger could have been the one with flash charging . Overall Camera quality . Speed and display are the plus points as well plus the screen size .####[['phone', 'could have been 10 % cheaper than the current price', 'negative'], ['phone', 'overall a good package', 'positive'], ['phone', 'slight heating issue', 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'Charger could have been the one with flash charging', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'quality', 'positive'], ['Speed', 'plus points', 'positive'], ['display', 'plus points', 'positive'], ['screen size', 'plus', 'positive']]
Really nice phone . Value for money . I am writing this review after using it for around 18 months . Camera super . I have used it while swimming under water it ' s a perfect waterproof phone . After using it in water dry the charging port otherwise it will not charge . Only constraint is battery life for heavy users . For light users it will last around 2 days but for heavy users maximum 12 hours .

After 15 days of use , I must say , this one is worth ! Nice speed and great performance ! They have given android 13 and it ' s a Jan 23 make ! Camera quality seems good and switching between the apps is also fast ! The audio jack is absent , but they have not made it slimmer ; hence , I feel , they should have given one . But as it ' s the flagship phone , it lacks the jack by default I guess . . It ' s a proposed water proof phone - so it ' s a good news ! It has wireless power sharing and it works . Battery lasts satisfactorily with a few settings . As of now , it ' s giving me more than 2 days ! Look is good and everything else seems fine .####[['phone', 'worth', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Nice speed', 'positive'], ['phone', 'great performance', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'quality seems good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'switching between the apps is also fast', 'positive'], ['audio jack', 'absent', 'negative'], ['phone', 'not made it slimmer', 'negative'], ['phone', 'lacks the jack by default', 'negative'], ['phone', 'proposed water proof', 'positive'], ['phone', 'wireless power sharing and it works', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'lasts satisfactorily with a few settings', 'positive'], ['phone', 'giving me more than 2 days', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Look is good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'everything else seems fine', 'positive']]
On a scale of 1 to 5 , no matter which aspect you concentrate , a minimum rating of 3 . 8 and up to 5 can be given . Camera is superb . Not for a hard - core gamer but best for a casual gamer , have been getting no lag gameplay for pubg at medium graphics and extreme framerate ( medium graphics are enough for me ) . Been using it for 5 months and no issues so far what so ever . Amoled screen did not disappoint , it has been a great experience . Unexpected surprise was that the speakers are pretty good . Secure folder feature has been good for mirror apps .

A flagship phone by Samsung would never disappoint . Same is the case with S20 FE 5G . Noth me and wife use this model and are happy with the overall performance . I would not compare with either iPhone or Chinese manufacturers as Samsung has it ' s own class .

Good in this price range with this kind of OS nd samsung branding along with a good processor too , bundled with a charger surprisingly , in short I would say a decent phone in this range , even providing many flagship features like wireless charging nd reverse wireless charging , good camera quality in day light , but average display in bright sunlight , hardly 404 nits brightness , 120hz refresh rate is amazing , video quality in uhd 60fps is magic , amazing sound quality with Dolby Atmos , but am missing that headphone jack , great to see ip68 rating in this range .

I was very happy with my purchase and fell so in love with the device that I even plunged into galaxy system eco - system and bought galaxy watch and wireless charger etc .  When all was going good , the phone display stopped working for no reason as I was scrolling thru the gallery images . The phone just blacked out on me . I was then travelling with wife and kid in a different state , and all my documents , tickets , receipt , contacts were saved in digital form in my phone . I was totally clueless what happened and how am I going to revive the display so that I can continue with my tour . Fortunately I forwarded all the tickets and Receipts to my wife ' s mobile and my galaxy watch had all my contact synced .  2 star for the samsung customer care for replacing the display in a day , being a premium customer .####[['display', 'stopped working for no reason', 'negative'], ['phone', 'just blacked out', 'negative'], ['samsung customer care', '2 star', 'positive'], ['samsung customer care', 'replacing the display in a day', 'positive']]
I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one . Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE . Used it for 2 - 3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least : ) . I had my personal data and office apps on it . 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work . had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app , contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it .####[['Samsung Galaxy 20 FE', 'had to suffer a lot', 'negative'], ['display', 'stopped', 'negative']]
Bought in Jun 2022 , delivered on 25th Jun , I find this hardware button to be broken / disassociated on Nov 5 , 2022 . Lucky for me , the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello - tape and sort of fix it ( jugaad ) . However , this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore . The quality is deteriorating . BTW , the phone never fell from my hand , had a protector almost immediately . Now of course , Samsung will claim I ( or my kids , or somebody else ) MUST have dropped it . I have spent too much of time setting this up , and I can ' t give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience .####[['hardware button', 'broken / disassociated', 'negative'], ['Samsung', 'quality is deteriorating', 'negative']]
The product seems to have a very common display Blackout issue requiring the display and battery to be changed . . . luckily for me it happened during warranty . . . then realised after searching for the issue online that for S20 FE it ' s a very common issue apparently for products sold during last great Indian festival sale . . . where in some cases Samsung had issued DOA and provided replacement . . . given that it ' s a known product issue on one of their galaxy series would have expected Samsung to have it resolved rather than causing inconvenience to customers buying their products####[['display', 'very common display Blackout issue', 'negative'], ['battery', 'changed', 'negative'], ['S20 FE', 'very common issue', 'negative']]
I am a big fan of Samsung mobile but this model utterly disappointed me . 1 . Battery life is not acceptable need to charge twice a day and also charging is too slow . I have another Samsung phone having 6000 mah battery it charges faster than this 4500 mah 2 . Signal and connectivity issues are there . I have tested my sim in other make mobile I would easily get 4 to 5 Mbps speed but in Samsung only 900 Kbps was max at that particular location . Being a 5 G phone this is what not expected . 3 .

Very good quality phone . But unfortunately phone started malfunctioning from 3rd of September . Charging port was not working . Eventually gave phone to Samsung service centre on 4th evening .

Why does samsung stick to exynos processors for its flag ship phones beats me . Qualcomm processors perform better , photos are better . finger print scanner sucks badly and even after a update at the samsung center , it doesn ' t work properly . photos are a big let down and night time pics are hopeless and so are the low light pics .

The phone keeps heating up for now reason ! It ' s a brand new phone I received today .

Phone ' s battery was not at all charged when received , so I put it on charging . After charging , phone was switched on and started software updates . Then I noticed that back panel has started coming off . You can in the attached images and videos that phone ' s back panel is coming out , and pasting glue is visible also . This must be due to battery overheating and swallowing . This is an horrible experience . After paying premium price for dated model still getting defective piece is an nightmare . On top of that product is not refundable . I raised return request , Amazon says the engineer will visit to inspect first . God know what will happen .

If you are using your mobile for phone call or just 5 - 10 photos at a time then only go for this mobile . Otherwise the worst mobile available at this price range . Camera quality at good sunlight is excellent . But images taken without sunlight is worst than some other low budget phone . . If you install some applications or watch some videos on internet for 10 mins then you can use mobile to iron box . Battery will drain so fast . But fast charging is okay . It will change fast . It will take around 1 . 30 hr for 60 - 70 % charge . There is not much lagging as if no . . But in my humble opinion never go for this phone . S10 . May be some other variant might be good .####[['mobile', 'worst mobile available at this price range', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'quality at good sunlight is excellent', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'images taken without sunlight is worst than some other low budget phone', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'NULL', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'drain so fast', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'fast charging is okay', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'change fast', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'around 1 . 30 hr for 60 - 70 % charge', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'not much lagging', 'neutral']]

1st couple of months everything was good . Now mobile network is not working good . Phone is heating up quite often . Night photos are almost close to worst .

I ' ve been using only Redmi phones since Redmi Note 3 was released . First dissapoinment was this purchase . Very low media volume . No indicator light for charging or notification .

This is basically a Android Go edition phone which has a bigger screen , and a Decent processor . This is not a phone to expect a gaming experience but still can play games like Subway Surfers .

Phone is good , but not excellent . I bought a low cost phone as i keep breaking phones . Although this says 4gb Ram , 64 GB storage , latest processor etc . This phone lacks lot of options that were available in the phone i had bought 3 years ago . Its probably good for people who dont use phone as their daily necessity to work , compute , record and depend . The battery is 5k MAH , but doesnt last more than a day . no short cuts available for screen shot , flash light , calculator , speed ram , clean up . There is no option for widgets too that i needed badly on my phones . Anyways , as said its a basic phone and the color and screen size is good . People say my pic isnt clear when we do video calling . . . .####[['Phone', 'good , but not excellent', 'neutral'], ['Phone', 'lacks lot of options', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'good for people who dont use phone as their daily necessity to work , compute , record and depend', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'doesnt last more than a day', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'no short cuts available for screen shot , flash light , calculator , speed ram , clean up', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'no option for widgets', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'basic', 'neutral'], ['screen', 'size is good', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'pic isnt clear when we do video calling', 'negative']]

I regret buying this device to be honest . Rear camera is average , front camera is below average ( photos taken with my old Samsung Mobile is way better ) .

Don ' t buy this phone if you ' re looking for gaming . Despite having a powerful processor , it ' s unable to handle most games .

Camera Quality is not good . I took pics of function but it takes the pic as dark faces . Its camera quality is very bad even below Rs . 8000 phones have good quality than this mobile .

Overall Phone performance is good , but there are many MI apps which you can ' t uninstall and those all default apps that used your mobile data quickly . The camera is mentioned 50 megapixels but it captures the photos in daylight very bad and not so clear , and night vision is even worst . seems like 5 - megapixel camera . MIUI is worst even that not allow us to hide apps in the drawer or not allow us to make folder groups of apps .

The quality of the power button is very poor . I purchased the device in Jan 2023 and the mobile started switching off automatically in April 2023 . When I went to the Service Centre they pointed to a scratch on the device ( As I don’t use screen guard and often keep and gave the verdict that the mobile was dropped , hence company warranty was not applicable and the repair was to be made at my own cost . I told them that there was no crack on screen or dent on any other part of the phone and asked them to write in writing that they confirm that the phone was dropped . However the service centre refused warranty claim citing company policies .####[['mobile', 'switching off automatically', 'negative'], ['power button', 'very poor ', 'negative'], ['service centre', 'refused warranty claim', 'negative']]

Coming from android to iphone its just phenomenal . Its buttery smooth , no lag what soever , camera is top notch like its top quality . I thought it would take time to get adjust to its OS but for me it was no problem . I thought I would miss many feature from android but tbh most of the androids features are gimmicky and I only ever miss multitasking from android .

As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say , iPhone is a good upgrade . I do , however , have some issues with the phone . If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues . As in , the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature . In the case of messages , you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option . Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone . I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls . Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e - sim , no dual tray for both your sim card . I am having issues with screencast / mirroring as well . In short , all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone . Other than that the phone is great . Camera is great with a lot of features ( which I’m still learning ) . Sound is great . No annoying nudges to keep updating apps . It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated . Easy to use once you get the hang of it .####[['iPhone', 'great', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'great', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'great', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'No annoying nudges to keep updating apps', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'good upgrade ', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'some issues', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'does not have mark as read option', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'Truecaller absolutely does not work', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'issues with screencast / mirroring', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'ot of features', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'does not have built in call recording', 'negative']]
Everything is good with this phone like camera ( highly impressive video quality ) , battery life ( normal use - more than 10hrs , Gaming - 4 - 5hrs ) , performance ( best ) .

I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately . This phone is perfect for all , whatever you need you can get from this device . Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb . Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7 - 8hrs of backup . Build quality is superb . The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate , Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it , rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate .

It is an amazing phone , the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones , it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6 - 7 hours screen time which is decent ( depending upon how you wanna use your phone , i use mine primarily for work , emailing , googling , watching videos and all ) . The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow , this is my switch from android to ios for the first time , although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great , total value for money ( got it for 62k )####[['phone', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['phone', 'experience is buttery smooth', 'positive'], ['battery', 'slightly let down', 'positive'], ['camera', 'actually great', 'positive'], ['battery', 'decent', 'positive'], ['camera', 'video quality is wow', 'positive'], ['phone', 'total value for money', 'positive'], ['phone', 'great', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'few restrictions in terms of customisation', 'negative'], ['battery life', '6 - 7 hours screen time', 'positive']]
The Picture Quality is amazing you don’t need to think twice about buying this for photos , just go for it .

I took this phone in Feb , after using it for a month , it’s almost good but when it comes to camera , it’s bit worst compared to android , not up to the mark and even if u have full network u will not get a proper internet connection , every time the network gets up and down and literally u will get disappointed .

Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement . Android users may find the security annoying . .

I paid 73 , 000 for a phone but they don ' t give a charger ! Thats so cheap about apple . Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste . Good decision . If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger , then why they need to produce new phones in the first place ?

I bought this phone keeping in mind that apple phone has very powerful processor , but it looks like at this price I could have bought a better android phone .

I have a very low opinion on Indian products due to the quality standards but this phone beats my opinion . Looks very premium and slim .

Let me start this review by talking about the battery , which is the main aspect of this device . Despite taking a bit longer than usual to charge , this monstrous 5000 - mah battery proves that it is a Nokia in disguise . The camera quality is good in UHD mode , the only mode I recommend . When it comes to performance , being awestruck is inevitable , as this is the epitome of software optimization . But too much multitasking slows down the device , which is normal for a device that boasts only 6GB of RAM . This device ' s HD + IPS display and an impressive speaker will let us zone out of our surroundings and plunge into the world of never - ending bliss . The benefits we get from this device are unbelievable for the price we are paying . You will never regret this purchase unless you are in the chase for the posh .####[['battery', 'taking a bit longer than usual to charge', 'negative'], ['camera', 'quality is good in UHD mode', 'positive'], ['performance', 'being awestruck is inevitable', 'positive'], ['software', 'too much multitasking slows down the device', 'negative'], ['display', 'HD + IPS', 'positive'], ['speaker', 'impressive', 'positive'], ['device', 'unbelievable for the price we are paying', 'positive']]

A fair price would be 6k or 7k for this quality . 2 . I liked the idea of Clean Android ( No Bloatware ) , but I was surprised that there was no gallery app . I could only view my photos and videos in google photos , which I did not like . The camera quality was also poor . 3 . The refresh rate is unsatisfactory . It leads to jerky and sluggish movement when I browse or slide .  Disappoint with the Indian phone . Hope they get better or if they want to continue , please sell it at lesser price .####[['LAVA phone', 'overpriced for its quality', 'negative'], ['Android', 'Clean', 'positive'], ['Android', 'No Bloatware', 'positive'], ['Android', 'no gallery app', 'negative'], ['camera', 'quality was also poor', 'negative'], ['refresh rate', 'unsatisfactory', 'negative'], ['LAVA phone', 'Disappoint', 'negative'], ['refresh rate', 'jerky and sluggish movement', 'negative']]

इसके जैसा घटिया फोन मैंने पूरे जीवन में नहीं देखा। ये सोचके फोन लिया कि भारतीय कंपनी है और इतनी कम कीमत में कुछ अच्छा ही दिया होगा लेकिन पैसे बर्बाद। इसमें इंटरनेट की स्पीड ना के बराबर है। कुछ भी प्ले करो वो बीच में ही बंद हो जाता है। ना तो डाउनलोड होता है ना ही कोई गाना या स्टोरी सुन पाता हूं परेशान हो गया हूं। बाकी चीजें ठीक हैं लेकिन यदि नेट ही सही से ना चले तो बाकी फीचर का क्या अचार डालूंगा। बिना नेट के तो मोबाइल कचरा ही होता है।####[['फोन', 'घटिया', 'negative'], ['फोन', 'पैसे बर्बाद', 'negative'], ['फोन', 'इंटरनेट की स्पीड ना के बराबर', 'negative'], ['फोन', 'बीच में ही बंद हो जाता', 'negative'], ['फोन', 'नेट ही सही से ना चले', 'negative']]

Light weight , sleek awesome samsung galaxy note . Awesome display , outstanding camera , s pen with sleek handset is very and unique and probably this is the last phone released which is both light weighted as well as s - pen note features .

Samsung Note 10 is epic device offering premium experience . However , necessary accessories to upgrade the phone to that feel are to be purchased additionally which come at a steep premium . For example , the clear back cover bundled with phone once replaced with LED flip case or Clear Display flip cover transforms the handling experience . Absence of 3 . 5 mm audio port is disappointing . It appears to be a strategic move from manufacturers to lure users buy additional gadgets like wireless earbuds ! Many of useful accessories are still not available in India . USB type - C to 3 . 5 mm audio port adapter is yet to be released . 45W Fast Charger is not bundled in phone box and still not available in markets even after three months of launch of Note 10 series . Wireless charger / power bank purchased separately from Samsung is also disappointing as it heats up while charging and drains in no time . Apart from few of these accessories related cons , Note 10 experience is super fantastic and hopefully will last long .####[['Samsung Note 10', 'premium experience', 'positive'], ['3 . 5 mm audio port', 'Absence', 'negative'], ['3 . 5 mm audio port', 'disappointing', 'negative'], ['accessories', 'not available in India', 'negative'], ['USB type - C', 'yet to be released', 'negative'], ['3 . 5 mm audio port adapter', 'yet to be released', 'negative'], ['45W Fast Charger', 'not bundled in phone box', 'negative'], ['45W Fast Charger', 'still not available in markets', 'negative'], ['Samsung Note 10', 'super fantastic', 'positive'], ['Samsung Note 10', 'heats up while charging', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'drains in no time', 'negative']]

I got this phone from Amazon for 50 k in Dec 2020 . . If i bought it at its original price , seriously this would have been a downer for me . . This phone is good ( despite lower screen size ) preferred this one of 10 + series . The best feature is its form factor and display . But if I do a comparison with my sister ' s phone ( one plus 7T pro ) , the battery is an area samsung seriously need to look at . The screen display is awesome and hence would need a minimum 4000 mah and this is really irritating since even without much use , my phone needs charging in 5 hours . Moreover given its refresh speed rate , I expect issues of lag in the future .

I have been using this phone for two months . According to the price range , the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good . According to this range , the camera is also fine . If we look at the performance , then it is not useless at all , but it is okay . I did not face any problem in calling . The phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps . If I give my opinion then this phone is good for parents . . . .

I bought this for office use . Has good battery life . And basic features of android work fine . However , I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition . I don ' t mind using it .

Writing this review after 24 hours of rigorous usage . Got the phone delivered yesterday . Phone is good for a low end use . You can definitely purchase it in case you want to use it as a backup phone . To be honest , I have purchased for the same reason . Phone is over all good . Yeah , it lags a little . Also , the video quality is not that good , but definitely you can use it for a temporary watching . Overall picture quality is satisfactory . The only major issue that I have faced is that while making any of the WhatsApp , Viber calls , the voice comes from the top speakers instead of the earpiece so it might be an issue in case if you want to talk something personal in a public place .####[['Phone', 'good for a low end use', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'over all good', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'ags a little', 'negative'], ['video', 'quality is not that good', 'negative'], ['picture', 'quality is satisfactory', 'negative'], ['earpiece', 'WhatsApp , Viber calls , the voice comes from the top speakers', 'negative']]
This device is good for them who are looking for a cheap secondary device .

I ordered it as I am a light user . I only use Chrome , YT , WhatsApp , Zee5 . For these apps 2GB Ram is enough . I have been using those apps in Samsung On5 1 . 5 GB Ram since 2016 , that too smoothly . But this phone may have some manufacturing issues I guess . This phone seems slow even in normal usage , forget the heavy usage , time lag in every action you do . Tap on any app icon , be it Chrome or YT , never opened immediately . Bit problem with Haptic feedback too . Moreover , you can ' t install full version Amazon app in in this phone , only a light version is supported which is less than 1 MB runs through Chrome .

I wanted a cheap phone as temporary basic , im not Android user for long and so did not like a lot of thing .

The battery is said to be 5000mah , however it must be of such a poor quality that it starts degenerating exponentially after the first use . RAM is much lesser than what is promised in the description which causes the mobile phone to glitch consistently . Image / photo quality is extremely poor .

I was skeptical about the phone would perform as SD 888 has its own share of heating issues and all , but for 28k , this is one of the best phones in the segment .  I had Pixel 6A and Nothing phone 1 as other options . Although their camera and software might be better in some aspects , the performance , the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible . Also Pixel and Nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it ' s a plus point .  The only issue I faced is when I switch the phone to 60Hz . It starts to act as it lowers to 30 , 40 fps or something . And the battery life is average . It ' s 1 charge in the evening for sure . But decent battery coupled with a fast charger is more than enough . I use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style .

The value for money of this product at a price of 26k is really good .

The Funtouch OS is perfectly optimised with Google . Camera Quality is one of the best both rear and front . There are various modes available to capture pictures . Night Vision is the best thing . It doesn ' t boost images and the AI is much better . Gaming experience is also better . Smoother frames , no excessive heating Battery lasts almost entire day . Around 5 . 5 - 6hrs of screen time if fully charged . Charging is the fastest . Takes around 35 - 40 mins for 0 to100 percent charge .

Idk why people give 1 2 stars complaining the battery life , maybe they dont have life outside mobile . The phone is literally good in all aspects , never expected such a beautiful camera , ordered for performance but the cam was deadly both front and back . Battery life is good too . 4 - 5hrs of PUBG and 8hrs of normal use its good . Like if you are an addict please change the lifestyle , have life outside phone . Everything is good from the OS to foot . And heating issue is that use in room temp or outside conditions its good otherwise it does heat a bit with 888 processor . But if you want both camera and performance its great . No lag in PUBG hotdrop bootcamp with recording . Remove bloatware and customize to your comfort .

So let ' s start with performance I get stable 60 fps on Apex legends and CODm and in fight it drops to 57 - 60fps . The camera is very good at this price segment even better than One plus 9RT . The battery drains a little fast but it with updates it would be fixed most probably . Also the battery performance doesn ' t bother me much . Since I use the phone it drops to 40 and in 20mins it ' s full charged . 0 - 100 takes 35 - 40 minutes .####[['camera', 'very good', 'positive'], ['battery', 'drains a little fast', 'positive'], ['battery', "performance doesn ' t bother", 'positive'], ['battery', '0 - 100 takes 35 - 40 minutes', 'positive']]

I Gifted this phone to myself on my birthday on 15 Aug 2022 . Really awesome phone , Battery drianed fast during installation of apps and restoration of data however was amazed by the charging time , it just took 20 minutes to charge the battery from 0 to 80 % . Touch is working very well , Shifted from Samsung to Iqoo hence you will feel slight difference in brightness . Didn ' t feel heating issue . BGMI is working smooth . Camera quality is good . I was initially in dilemma wheather to buy a Non branded phone or not , but due to flagship features Iqoo is offering at lower price I went ahead and bought it . Really happy with the product . This phone has exceeded my expectations .####[['phone', 'Really awesome', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'drianed fast during installation of apps', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'amazed by the charging time', 'positive'], ['Battery', '20 minutes to charge the battery from 0 to 80 ', 'positive'], ['phone', "Didn ' t feel heating issue", 'positive'], ['phone', 'BGMI is working smooth', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'quality is good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'flagship features', 'positive'], ['phone', 'lower price', 'positive'], ['Touch', 'working very well', 'positive']]
Using this phone for 4 days now and it ' s performance is top notch . Haven ' t faced any heating issues as of now . Not even during game play . It gets slight heated but cool down even faster . Battery could have been a bit better . Not disappointing though . Giving me enough juice for a day . Charging speed is very good which kind of compensates for the battery backup . Camera is decent . Haven ' t tested it to the limit . Design and in hand feel is excellent . Doesn ' t feel heavy . Display is just amazing . Dual stereo speakers could have been louder . But they are decent . If you have a budget of 30 - 35k , go for it .

I bought this phone it ' s an excellent phone but for the gaming experience I would deduct one star , if the company in future make an update of better gaming may be it would be good for gaming but for now it doesn ' t support 90 Fps in bgmi and has heating and frame dropping proplems . .

The phone is good and okay for the price it offers . Rear camera has is okay just as we see in vivo phones and gives pictures with true colour , sometimes the background such as blue sky or light colours tend to appear white If u use AI . Selfies are bit grainy but its okay . The 888 SoC is okay but it is no where near 8 Gen 1 . The games lags at full definition .

Every thing is nice the best phone in the given price bracket but th only problem is battery life . It takes only 6 to 7 hrs to drain if continuous gaming is done . Otherwise it is nice can last upto 1 and a half day . But if you consider the fast charging which actually charges the phone In less than 30 mins it sums up for that given disadvantage . Funtouch os 13 is also very smooth and gives a stock android feel .####[['battery life', 'problem', 'negative'], ['battery life', '6 to 7 hrs to drain if continuous gaming', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'ast upto 1 and a half day', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'charges the phone In less than 30 mins', 'positive'], ['Funtouch os 13', 'very smooth', 'positive'], ['Funtouch os 13', 'gives a stock android feel', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Every thing is nice', 'positive'], ['phone', 'given price bracke', 'positive']]
Before buying this phone , i researched about this phone a lot . Now after a two week of usage of this device , this is a monster for this price range . All the review i read about this phone before buying was heating issue , screen flickering , and battery . I will clarify about this issues . First is screen flickering - we can ' t able to experience any type of flickering issues with normal eyes . It can only see through other cameras . About 70 percent smart phones have flickering in low brightness . And will be fixed with update . Second is heating - no heating at all for me for normal use and heavy usage like just every other phones heating . While charging it will heat up . Its 66W charging ( not 10 W charging . ) . Every phone with high wattage charge will heat up . Third is battery - yes battery draining is there . But with 66W charge you will not able to realise the battery draining . Now a days phones with high wattage charger has battery draining . Thats not an issue . Overall blindly go for this phones at this price segment . Its a worth buying . TRULY ITS A MONSTER####[['phone', 'monster for this price range', 'positive'], ['phone', 'no heating', 'positive'], ['phone', "can ' t able to experience any type of flickering issues", 'positive'], ['battery', 'draining is there', 'negative'], ['battery', 'While charging it will heat up', 'negative'], ['battery', '66W charge', 'positive'], ['phone', 'worth buying', 'positive'], ['phone', 'A MONSTER', 'positive'], ['phone', 'blindly go for this phones at this price segmen', 'positive']]
Its a gaming phone I didn ' t find the camera particularly good many oppo realme phones have almost the same quality . If you want camera in this range then go for the Samsung fe series .

Everything thing is good and it is more than enough for daily operations at this price range . The only problem with this phone is output sound from speakers whoch isnot that good .

I brought iqoo 9 se 12gb varient on 2nd of may at 26000 after exchange and discount . Ad 888 Little heat but good . I dont know why in premium segment 2 mp camera is given . Its of no use . 2nd it has slightly low builed quality if i compare it with other brands in this price range . Within three months i gone for its screen replacement which costs 6800 .

Average rear camera on both night and day time . Good display , brightness is ok , no flickering at all , stereo speakers are ok , front camera is superb , rear camera for just a photo is good , but for videos the setup is worst , jitters and overprocessed looks , call quality is awesome , connectivities are very good , processing is speeding is fast as expected , bloatwares are not so much intimidating , you can uninstall most of them turn off notifications for the rest , battery backup is ok , for a office guy this backup just enough , charging speed is around 40 - 50 min , iam no gamer , so i don ' t know about the gaming experience , overall a good choice for me .

This is the best phone u can get under 30k if you consider performance although it ' s also good In others aspects like media consumption and camera .

I believe it ' s priced a little bit on the higher side but still it ' s better than its competitors . Display is less bright than I hoped , with okayish resolution .

Although most of things about purchase can be considered decent given the price I paid for it but the most unjustifiable problem with the phone was it ' s performance . It ' s hella slow for a phone a with 4gb ram and opens everything too late . The redme 9A sport I bought for a relative has a better performance with only 2gb ram . I first thought it ' s just happening because we ' re setting it up but it persisted and is still quite slow . Also the fingerprint sensor is also not that responsive .

I am posting this review after extensive use of the mobile and I can surely say that this is the one of the best budget 5G mobile which comes with a nice processor and able to handle all day to day task with very smoothly and with ease . But camera quality is the thing which could be improved . However all other things are upto the mark and highly recommend product in this price range . One of the best 5G budget mobile####[['processor', 'nice', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'best budget 5G', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'handle all day to day task with very smoothly', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'with ease', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'could be improved', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'highly recommend product in this price range', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'best 5G budget mobile', 'positive']]
This phone is O . K for me as I am not a heavey gamer or photographer , although i watch a lot of videos on phone . After extensive research , I selected this 5 G phone . First it was cheapest in this range and was providing maximum features . 2nd Dual speakers are really good . 3rd Charger was also with in box , which charges my phone really fast . 4th Camera is also O . K . if you are not shooter . However only drawback is it really sucks in sunlight , screen almost goes black and Unnecessary apps are also annoying . For daily normal usage it is value for money####[['phone', 'cheapest in this range', 'positive'], ['phone', 'providing maximum features', 'positive'], ['Dual speakers', 'really good', 'positive'], ['Charger', 'really fast', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'O .

I had purchased this to gift to my SIS for rakhi . She loved the phone . The camera quailty is good but not execllent and it was quick to lock focus . Battery life is good and she told me that the battery lasted for than 2 days without any issues . REDMI NOTE 11T 5G is value for money . If camera performance is the high priority then it will fall short otherwise very good phone is the budget .####[['REDMI NOTE 11T 5G', 'loved', 'positive'], ['camera', 'quailty is good', 'positive'], ['camera', 'not execllent', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'quick to lock focus', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'good', 'positive'], ['Battery life', 'lasted for than 2 days', 'positive'], ['REDMI NOTE 11T 5G', 'value for money', 'positive'], ['camera performance', 'fall short', 'negative'], ['REDMI NOTE 11T 5G', 'very good phone is the budget', 'positive']]
I bought this phone for Rs . 15 , 300 / - and the phone is nice but there is little lag in Fingerprint sensor placed at the side of the phone otherwise the phone is good in this price range . The phone gets charged in just 45 to 50 minutes from 15 % to 100 % . Battery backup is also good it last for around two days if not used extensively . The company should provide atleast one more rear camera in this price range . Mi phones are best i have been using Redmi note 5 pro before this phone and the previous phone i bought on 15th August 2018 and its still working .

Earlier I was confused about buying note 10 pro or 11t 5g . No doubt note 10 pro ' s camera & display quality is better than 11t but it cannot beat 11t ' s performance and battery . Yeah I also agree 11t ' s camera quality and display could have been better but still I don ' t have any issue . They ' re doing well for me . Its display is quite good and it is not that bad as it is shown in some YT review videos when we ' re outside . Now when comes to the performance and battery , this phone is a beast man . . ! ! It ' s so smooth . You cannot complain here . Thank you .

I like this phone very much it ' s an amazing device , the functionality , the speed , the ease of opening and transitioning from one app to another and opening multiple apps , the sound etc is really good .

The product is a good budget smartphone . Camera Quality is 5 - Star . Display and touch Sensitivity , gestures is good . Fingerprint scanner is slow .

Battery life and performance is good and charging with 33 watt is satisfactory . Could have more little more brightness expected in outdoors . Sound is good and watching media content is pleasing with its thin display edges . Ram management is need to improve , even if it having 6 gb ram plus 2 gb virtual ram features it kills most of apps in the background . Camera is average and need software update along with andriod 12 . Front camera is good as compare to back . No any heating or lag issue in day to day uses . Call quality is good , loud and clear but lacks premium phone like quality . 5g capable with mediatek 810 . Security update is slower than low budget mi phones as now I received may month patch and it ' s already July month . Overall good phone but need improvement through update for sure . If you don ' t want to spend 20k on phone but need powerful and overall good package then you can go for it as all 5g phone under 20 k has lots of compromise but this has very few .####[['Battery', 'life and performance is good', 'positive'], ['Sound', 'good', 'positive'], ['display', 'little more brightness expected in outdoors', 'negative'], ['display', 'watching media content is pleasing', 'positive'], ['Ram management', 'need to improve', 'negative'], ['Ram management', 'kills most of apps in the background', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'average', 'neutral'], ['Front camera', 'good as compare to back', 'positive'], ['phone', 'ag issue in day to day uses', 'positive'], ['phone', 'No any heating', 'positive'], ['Call quality', 'good', 'positive'], ['Call quality', 'loud', 'positive'], ['Call quality', 'clear', 'positive'], ['mediatek 810', '5g capable', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Security update is slower', 'negative'], ['Call quality', 'acks premium phone like quality', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Overall good phone but need improvement through update', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'powerful', 'positive'], ['phone', 'overall good package', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'charging with 33 watt is satisfactory', 'positive']]

The first phone I got had damaged speakers . The replacement is good in all aspects . The Speaker is very loud and doesn ' t crack at high volume . Battery doesn ' t last full day as advertised , maybe yes , if you keep it idle . Phone is performance based and works smoothly . It doesn ' t heat up while working , but it does while charging . Front camera is decent but rear camera is despicable . It ' s not the quality but the contrast level that makes you look ugly by making every crease on your face prominent .####[['NULL', 'replacement is good in all aspects', 'positive'], ['Speaker', 'very loud', 'positive'], ['Speaker', "doesn ' t crack at high volume", 'positive'], ['Battery', "doesn ' t last full day as advertised", 'negative'], ['Phone', 'works smoothly', 'positive'], ['Phone', "doesn ' t heat up while working", 'positive'], ['Front camera', 'decent', 'positive'], ['rear camera', 'despicable', 'negative']]

The cameras photo quality was not bad but the video quality was so bad it just glicthes sometimes like it make some part very dark and the other parts very bright and the back panel is like made up of toy plastic the back panel is so bad that it felt like you can snap it with your fingers it can break if you tap on it with your fingernail a little hard .

Desent phone overall . Battery life is good , charges in less time . Just a few cons - Bad camera quality pictures break into pixels , the brightness is very low even when you raise it to full brightness level , cannot insert sd card if you have 2 sims ( only 2 slots , 1 for sim , other for sim / sd card , only 1 can be inserted ) . There is no bling light like in previous models ( the small led blinking continuously when the screen is asleep for notifications ) , you don ' t know if u have any notifications till u wake the screen . Also the fingerprint sensor sometimes will not unlock the phone ( very rare , but happens ) , so u have to type in the password .####[['phone', 'Desent', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'life is good', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'charges in less time', 'positive'], ['camera quality', 'Bad', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'pictures break into pixels', 'negative'], ['brightness', 'very low even when you raise it to full brightness level', 'negative'], ['phone', 'cannot insert sd card if you have 2 sims', 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'sometimes will not unlock the phone', 'negative']]

The performance of this mobile is not what Mi used to provide in previous phones . Dual speaker is of no use ! The speaker on the top of the phone is barely audible .

Just after 6 months of usage . The phone hangs , it ' s slow after switching to 90htz refresh . It ' s really cumbersome to use , if you wish to do multi - tasking .

Even call recordign doens ' t work as gogle restriction put any way good for beginners only nice feature is fingure gesture screenshot . Photo camera not up to mark . you can notice image quality . Even nokia n72 produces crispy images better than this . Nokia Lumia 800 has better picutre quality . And non removable battery is another setback .

Never buy these tecno smartphones , because in all these tecno phones there is full of bloatware which can be very problematic , in my case it fails to connect to my projector mirrorcast because in the phone root it is programmed only to connect with tv mirrorcast not with other mirrorcast there is lag while watching movies playing games even simple one like subway surfer , very bad ram management , reason is pre installed bloatware wich is the part of phone os neither u can disable nor u can uninstall , one good thing is fhd + display .

Outstanding phone from Techno . See the photographs . Enlarge it . It will not fade out rather the real photograph will come out . I have compared it with Vivo X90 . In photographs facing bright light the picture of Vivo loses the skin tone , if you enlarge . This phone is really gorgeous . I am really fortunate that I choosed it not iPhone 14 plus at this price . This phone is really gorgeous in hand . I am using it throughout the day seeing You Tube but could not finish the Battery . Remember , the Always on Display is Video not photo . A great feel in hand . The fold will not automatically open even if you hang it with one leaf of it . Really great in aesthetics too . If one can afford , this is indeed a great phone to buy . Techno had really came out as a brand . It ' s great . An extraordinary phone .

I didn ' t want to spend 1 . 5 Lakhs on the new fold 4 , so bought the Phantom V Fold after hearing great feedback from the YouTube community . This phone is a massive upgrade to the Samsung Fold 3 which I was previously using . The camera is superb , touch is way better than Samsung , the interface is very good , bigger screen . Over all it feels great to hold the phone . Also the back cover free with the phone makes it very easy to hold it when fully open . This is my best phone buy till date .

This is an amazing phone . Once my son had taken our scooter with him . Not knowing what to do , I said , " Hello Google . Take me to office . " Suprisingly the phone asked me to open it and sit on the screen . When I did so , it transported me within seconds to my office . This phone has the ability to solve all the problems of India ! ! According to me the price of this phone should atleast be 10 lakhs .####[['phone', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['phone', 'ability to solve all the problems', 'positive']]
Man o man , this is my first fold and also my first phone above 30k . Was very skeptical to buy it and even cancelled once then bought it finally . I should tell you that this phone is a beast when it comes to performance , features , security , the fold experience . It has everything one would ask for in a fold and some more . It has the perfect aspect ratio for both screens , has the largest battery life and the UI and tecno has so much more to offer . Within 7 days of purchase got 2 system updates and improvements . The camera is not the most perfect but I am nt a camera guy so didnt bother me . Overall very happy with the purchase and worth the price .

If phantom will be able to reconstruct it ' s software properly this phone is marvelous . There is sometimes network issue , heating problem this can be fix by software update .

I see too many 5 star reviews for this phone . I also saw lot of videos on you tube and all spoke highly about the phone and I decided to buy the phone . Else than a gold phone there is nothing else you will get for this cost . The phone is so heavy that you need both hands to operate which is very frustrating when you are on the move or is busy with something and just want to check the phone . Attending calls on speaker is a nightmare , volume is too low and hard to communicate on speaker mode . Battery is a disaster , I charged the phone to 100 percent and by afternoon 1 pm , battery is just 35 percent left and I didn ' t even use the fold open mode much , I didn ' t watch any video etc . I didn ' t play any game . Overall just a gold phone .

This is the best one for gaming , best phone under 12000 . But the camera filter is not so good , but also I ' m happy with this because this phone gives smooth lag free performance after installing bgmi , gta , critical strike and many games at a time , and also give long battery backup up to 6 to 7 hours of gameplay .

Its really a good find for me TECNO POVA 4 in 12k budget . After a complete 4 day use I must say that this a phone which I was looking for months .

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device . Wish i had gone with poco , the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues . And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates .

First of all I used this device for business purposes , Battery is best part of it almost 3 days still 8 % remaining , I use whatsapp , youtube , Google Chrome , calls and sometimes camera . All this work like a charm . Look and Display are very nice , Display is big enough for your daily work and to keep in your pocket . camera is batter then other Chinese variants , it has gorilla Glass protection and no IP protection means you need to protect it from water splash . Battery In whole night only use 2 % , no bloatware , clean os , not any false battery draining . I used Jio 5G works like butter in Mumbai . Used this phone for 7 days there is no lag I found in any software , software opening is fast . Overall it ' s best phone for day to day life work and business purposes . I have 6 GB variant .

Good phone in its category in budget segment . Special highlight is it ' s monster battery + Above average camera and ok type performance . This phone is not for a gamer / photographer because it can provide you everything in its limit . Never compare it with Galaxy S23 Ultra or iPhone 14 like performance and feature . It is just like comparing Alto with BMW or Ferrari . Where Alto is best known for its mileage this phone is best for its battery endurance .

Ordered it for my Dad . Samsung never disappoints . Decent screen and camera quality . Performance wise its so good , did not face any issue till now . Seen other bad reviews , probably they are using it with other unwanted apps , bloatwares and expecting very high end gaming performance . Even I bought only 4GB RAM version and it works like a charm without any hiccups , 4G carrier aggregation , 5G reception and speed everything works fine .

I purchased this phone on the day it was launched and I found defects on the display and the phone was defective . Defective because the portion below the sim slot on the left hand side made clicking sound when pressed which means the case is little bigger than the phone . I returned the phone and the new phone also came with the same defect but now on the right hand side below the fingerprint sensor . I m returning it again . Only good thing is the battery but if it comes with a defect then what ' s the point ? Also when you are spending 1000 more for the charger .

It ' s an utter disgrace that it comes with no charger and fast charging is not compatible with other brand chargers . Apart from that , it just randomly switches to 4g from 5g with no option to revert back to 5g .

I like the specifications of the phone which are mid - range specifications of under rs20 , 000 . . . the battery is so huge can easily operate whole day once charged full , the fingerprint and face lock are really fast , like mid - range smartphone , camara is perfect for under 10 , 000 , also one thing I like it it has Bokeh mode in videography . .

Recommended for everyone whose budget is under 10K . Budgetwise camera and mobile is out of the world . Amazing . Bought it at 9K . Provides more features than other phones in this range . Camera quality is superb . More than expected I would say . Recommended to everyone if their budget is below 10K . Bloatwares can be easily uninstalled .

Honestly speaking I was looking for a phone which contains a good battery , fast charging , 4gb ram and super performance with a good display quality . And this phone literally fulfilled each and every aspects except camera , and it was never my concern . But in this price range I can assure you it has more than average camera . So if you are looking for a phone under 10000 , you should go for it . It is the best option for sure .####[['battery', 'good', 'positive'], ['battery', 'fast charging', 'positive'], ['display quality', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'super performance', 'positive'], ['phone', 'literally fulfilled each and every aspects', 'positive'], ['camera', 'more than average', 'positive'], ['phone', 'under 10000 , you should go for it', 'positive'], ['phone', 'best option for sure', 'positive']]

This was the first time I put temper screen by myself. Since im a novice, there was bubbles after applying but not many. I applied the whole glue and shown in UV light they have given along with it. I brought down my mobile so many times in low distance I have some cracks but that scratches not visible as we put temper glass in regular mobile stores, it was very lite. One should keenly watch my mobile to find out whether it has crack or not. Though price is high, I have put temper glass for same price outside but that was not last even for 3 months. This is worth for money. Original temper glass I think not cheap quality.####[]

I got completely messed up when went to dress shopping and wanted to get suggestions from someone over the phone .

As always , Nokia has yet again amazed us with a new powerful budget smartphone ! There’s nothing to not love about this device - the large HD + screen ( though FHD could have been provided at this price range ) with 90Hz refresh rate ; fast , responsive Fingerprint Sensor ; the camera is so much better with AI imaging ! And as always , Stock Android and Nokia’s Optimised Performance combined offer a long battery life of at - least 2 days ! The back panel has a textured finish , I personally love the design ! The device came with pre - applied Screen Protector , but you’d want to get a new edge - to - edge screen protector applied as the one that it came with wouldn’t withstand scratches or falls from heights . All in all , definitely a smart buy !####[['Nokia', 'amazed us with a new powerful budget', 'positive'], ['smartphone', 'amazed us with a new powerful budget', 'positive'], ['screen', 'large HD', 'positive'], ['camera', 'so much better with AI imaging', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint Sensor', 'fast', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint Sensor', 'responsive', 'positive'], ['Stock Android', 'Optimised Performance', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'long', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'at - least 2 days', 'positive'], ['back panel', 'love the design', 'positive'], ['smartphone', 'definitely a smart buy', 'positive'], ['Screen Protector', 'pre - applied', 'positive']]

The phone offers stock Android and 2 guaranteed Android updates which makes it a good choice in the price segment .

The mobile is working nice and battery backup is good . I like the battery backup and touch screen . The cell is so nice and look wise it ' s great . But it ' s best mobile at this price . The drawback of the mobile is camera clarity and screen resolution . Eventjough its mentioned that it has 50MP resolution , it does give pictures of that quality .

I recently purchased the Nokia G11 Plus mobile phone , and unfortunately , my experience with this phone has not been great . It has some significant issues that make it difficult to use . One of the most frustrating issues with this phone is that it hangs too much , making it hard to complete even simple tasks . Additionally , the phone has a tendency to switch off randomly , which can be quite inconvenient , especially when I ' m in the middle of something important .  The battery life on this phone is also a major concern . The battery drains very rapidly , even when the phone is not in use , which means that I have to charge it frequently throughout the day .####[['Nokia G11 Plus', 'has not been great', 'negative'], ['Nokia G11 Plus', 'difficult to use', 'negative'], ['Nokia G11 Plus', 'hangs too much', 'negative'], ['Nokia G11 Plus', 'hard to complete even simple tasks', 'negative'], ['Nokia G11 Plus', 'has a tendency to switch off randomly', 'negative'], ['Nokia G11 Plus', 'quite inconvenient', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'major concern', 'negative'], ['battery', 'drains very rapidly', 'negative'], ['battery', 'have to charge it frequently', 'negative']]

I brought this phone primarily hoping that it would have a long battery life and I would be able to just use it to send and receive phone calls .

नोकिया इस कंपनी का मोबाइल मैं 2009 से इस्तेमाल कर रहा हूं और हर बार कुछ बेहतर होता है इस बार भी कंपनी अपने मेरे विश्वास पर खरी उतरी है, जहां तक नोकिया जी21 की बात करें तो सबसे अच्छा इसका बैटरी लाइफ है जो की लगातार इस्तेमाल करने पर करीब 36 घंटे का बैकअप है कैमरा बहुत अच्छा है एंड्रॉयड 11 पर आता है पर एक हफ्ते बाद Android 12 अपडेट का ऑप्शन आ गया मोबाइल के पीछे ग्रिप बनी है जो की हाथो में पकड़ती है सब मिलकर इस बजट में बहुत ही अच्छा फोन है धन्यवाद नोकिया एंड अमेजन####[]
I purposely chose Nokia over other brands in this value segment because it is a brand that I innately trust . Also , it isn ' t just emotions at work here , this is a device that runs on stock android , has a good screen size , is light and not bulky , and comes at a price that doesn ' t hurt the wallet . Personally , I ' m a OnePlus 7Pro user . However , should that ever get damaged or stolen and I should need a back - up phone for long - term usage as a follower of minimalism , I ' ll opt for this in a heartbeat . The delivery occurred on time , the price was good courtesy the Amazon cashback offers , and the phone makes the person who received it as a gift happy , so all in all , a good purchase !####[['Nokia', 'innately trust', 'positive'], ['stock android', 'runs', 'positive'], ['screen size', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'light', 'positive'], ['phone', 'not bulky ', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'cashback offers', 'positive'], ['phone', 'a good purchase', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'delivery occurred on time', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'price was good courtesy', 'positive'], ['Nokia', "price that doesn ' t hurt the wallet", 'positive']]
I ' ve bought Nokia G21 after using Nokia 8 . 1 for three years . The previous experiences of Nokia has always been pleasant . With Nokia G21 , my experience has only been elevated . At the outset , the feel of the phone is fabulous . The added new features of Android 12 gives a smooth experiences , coupled with a power pack battery life . Regular security updates and OS upgradation surely makes Nokia G21 , a class apart with other competitors in the market . The AI 50 MP camera gives a superb quality to the photographs . The build quality is smooth and gives a premium feel and look . The phone is fully featured loaded just as it is expected . The best part of Nokia has always been a bloat free apps in the phone . Overall a very nice phone .

I am impressed by the Nokia series of phones ; I got this one for my dad and so far he has been extremely satisfied with the phone . The device feels and looks sturdy and despite the low price compared to other brands , it is pretty responsive and does not display any lag . Plus , the absence of any manufacturer ' s own bloatware makes it a very " light " phone to use , and not confusing the elders like him . I am not very gung ho about its camera though , and hence I have not gone ahead and given 5 stars . And its not like my dad is into professional photography so not an issue at all . In a nutshell , I am impressed by the Nokia series , given the features and its price point and I have gone ahead and got the C21 Plus for my teenager two days back .

I presented this phone to my Father in - law and mother in - law recently . They were never familiar with Android phone and had been using the old nokia handsets forever . Initially they were a bit hesitant to use it but as we started teaching them , they found the simplicity of this model and were soon excited to use them ! It ' s been a week since they have been using the Nokia G21 and they ' re really happy with it . The audio quality of the phone is excellent . They are super excited about the camera since they never clicked photos of their own . My father in - law watches cricket on YouTube and the wide screen of the phone does justice to his cricket cravings . The UI of the phone is user friendly , security measures are on power and the 50MP camera helps my mom in - law take amazing photos of her beautiful garden !

Fingerprint reader is snappy , battery life is huge - can last upto 3 days without charging if used for basic purpose like calling and wifi on full time , and moderate internet usage and apps , calls , etc . Camera quality is okay in this range considering price . Body looks good . Performance is also good , at the beginning it was snappy , but now a little less reponsive after about 15 days of usage - still good .

Phone is ok for general usage , but my struggles with Nokia continue . The place where I live has no proper mobile reception , I ' m heavily dependent on Vo Wifi calling . i had absolutely no issues with my previous Samsung phone , but Nokia G21 frequently disconnects in the middle of a call . I tried reaching out to customer service but was not helpful . Advertisements are promising but I don ' t find it living up to it . Camera is not great either . Promise of 2year updates is another disappointment . There is Android 13 available and my G21 still runs on Android 11 . At this rate , they can promise 4 years of updates also but it does not help customers .  I always knew Nokia is bit expensive at this range compared to others . Only because my affinity towards Nokia I still bought this one , though I didn ' t have a great experience with Nokia 6 either .

Overall experience is better , no lagging , best usage in office use and general purposes , I would suggest though , go with the 6gb RAM and 128gb Internal Storage expandable memory upto 512gb varient . camera quality is decent but the most noticeable is the battery backup which is phenomenal . But there is a reason to giving it 3 stars . Whenever you buy , there will be a sticker attach to the package saying that you have to give 5 stars and write a great review in amazon and take a screen shot and post it to Nokia ' s official site to get Brand new Nokia Earphones ( Which is a gimmick ) . It is a total mar letting strategy . And I would like to add that it ' s speaker sound is not going to be satisfying .

product packing was bad , it looked as though I got an already opened product , the fingerprint reader is not reading all the time , I have to depend on face unlock , and battery life is down in a day and half and does not stay for 2 even with only calls and WhatsApp usage with 60 Hz screen rate instead of higher . sometimes browser hangs . The phone looks good and feels sturdy for the price , I use only the charger shipped with the box , and the phone charges in about 2 hours or a little over .####[['NULL', 'product packing was bad', 'negative'], ['fingerprint reader', 'not reading all the time', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'down in a day and half', 'neutral'], ['battery life', 'does not stay for 2 even with only calls', 'negative'], ['phone', 'sometimes browser hangs', 'negative'], ['phone', 'looks good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'feels sturdy for the price', 'positive'], ['charger', 'charges in about 2 hours or a little over', 'negative']]
Though the mobile offers 3 day backup , I would say that it gives me only 2 day backup . I would like to add that I use this phone only for basic purposes like texting , calling etc and not into any kind of gaming .

The fingerprint sensor and camera is just average .####[['camera', 'ust average', 'neutral'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'ust average', 'neutral'], ['backup', 'only 2 day backup', 'negative']]
Experience of 70 days. During delete, select all menu , in the App of contacts , sms, is not given, its a problem. During night, only 5% battery drains , Camara quality is not like Samsung 50 mp. Zooming creates blurring. Battery performance is the best during use but non use drais 100% in 36 hours. 120 m takes to charge 100%. Touch is like Samsung. Numbers of Calculator is too Big. Front camera n Speaker are the best. Price is affordable. Automatic battery saver mode is given. At all Nokia is brand . Out look of mobile is the best####[]
After using it for almost a month , did not find it upto mark On multitasking the phone hangs everytime on the app you are working on , not at all satisfied This was not expected atleast from Nokia , I never used Nokia before so decided to use it but it dissappointed me extremely , no way to recommend this brand to anyone .

I have been using Nokia 3 for the past 4 and a half years . I wished to upgrade it as the software was old and my phone hardware began to show issues too . Chose Nokia g21 as it was a budget phone . Camera and other superb performances were not important for me . But it disappointed me as the phone fails to connect to the saved wifi networks automatically . I tried out all the possible solutions shown in the youtube videos available ( restarting phone , resetting network settings , re - saving wifi and even static ip was given ) but everything failed . My old phone was a good and dear companion for me but this one is literally a pain ! ! !####[['networks', 'fails to connect to the saved wifi', 'negative'], ['networks', 'everything failed', 'negative'], ['Nokia g21', 'literally a pain', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'superb', 'positive'], ['performances', 'superb', 'positive'], ['networks', 'disappointed', 'negative']]
The phone ' s battery is experiencing excessive heat , which is concerning . I had Nokia mobile phones long back . I used to always trust this brand . But in the middle as it was not having Android phone , So for last couple of years , I have used either Iphone or Samsung . However , upon discovering that Nokia now offers Android phones , I decided to purchase it . I stay in USA and bought it for my Father in India from Amazon . I was thrilled to be able to gift him a brand that we both had faith in . Unfortunately , the phone has not lived up to our expectations . It lacks the durability and reliability that we associated with the Nokia brand , which I had even boasted about in stories of my old Nokia phone still functioning today . The battery overheating issue has rendered the phone unusable , causing me to lose faith in the brand that I had once trusted so deeply . It is a total loss buying this . It is disheartening to have paid the price for my past trust in Nokia without realizing that this new Nokia not the same .####[['battery', 'experiencing excessive heat', 'negative'], ['phone', 'not lived up to our expectations', 'negative'], ['phone', 'acks the durability and reliability', 'negative'], ['phone', 'overheating issue has rendered the phone unusable', 'negative'], ['battery', 'overheating issue has rendered the phone unusable', 'negative'], ['phone', 'total loss buying', 'negative'], ['phone', 'disheartening to have paid the price', 'negative'], ['Nokia', 'lose faith in the brand', 'negative']]
Please do not buy this phone . This phone got blasted while it was on charging .

I had the worst experience with this phone ! I use my phone for online counseling sessions , and this phone has a terrible echo problem when put on speaker , and the person on the other end can ' t even have a proper conversation because they can constantly hear their own voice ! I got a replacement handset but still had the same problem . I tried to get technicians to visit , but none of them did ! The camera was good , and so was the battery life , but the user interface is weird and very confusing . Also , the OS kept asking me to reformat my memory card so I kept losing all my data ! ! Not sure why this phone is getting such high reviews . I believe it ' s probably because the phone box says you ' ll get a free set of earphones if you write a good review ! Eventually , I tried to return it and that too was a horrendous ordeal because I didn ' t get the refund despite giving the phone back , for over two weeks after multiple follow ups !

This phone is just awesome for this budget . Not for fans of high end mobiles nor for high setting gamers . Its not cheap plastic as mentioned on youtube by some youtubers . This is a budget phone with very good specification and in reality as well . I am a moderate user and this phone fulfils all my needs . Its truely an allrounder and lets not compare it with higher budget phones . Display is quite good and soothing but not too bright and punchi as its just hd , but it does not look like . Its preety up and down compared to its competators and then its you to decide and your trust on the brand . It looks fabulous and especially the lunar red one and is in no way inferior . Much premium in hand feeling and quite light in weight . Its preety flat at the back . I think xiomi has done a great job on this phone and at this budget . Perfect phone for medium users . I definately recommened this phone .

This phone falls under beginner level smart phone . This handset is very much suitable for average users who spend time on YouTube and whatsapp or you can say moderate user . If u expect good gaming experience this phone is big NO . Battery performance is very impressive . Display is very nice indoors bit in outdoor u need to switch to 100 % brightness level . Camera is decent in that price range . Finger print scanner is fast enough . Without cover handset is slippery . Provided cover barely gives any protection to it ' s camera lens .

I cant stare to phone there after . I have other smart phone also and i used to see videos for hours . Working on laptop but never experienced before . I tried to replace but amazon refused by saying that is not a valid reason without giving any technical assistance . Please give my feedback to them and assist me as a good vendor .

I've used both realme c2 and redmi 7 for 2 weeks now and here's my review - redmi has better cameras, lil fast charging, back cover, better processor. Whereas realme has better shape & feels really good in hand redmi is kinda thick and requires two hands, better looking notch, doesn't get dirty easily like redmi, pre applied scratch guard so choose what you want from a phone. None of em lags in normal day to day tasks, both can be rooted, oem unlocking is supoorted in c2 too, both have google camera ports too but redmi clicks a lot better pics.####[]
Phone is lagging . Camera lagging . During pubg server didn ' t connect error for many times . so you can ' t play pubg in it . There is no eis in it hence it is not suitable for videography . Battery is huge & easily provide a backup for atleast 2 days ( standard usage ) . Battery takes atleast 2 . 30 hour to charge fully . This device doesn ' t support fast charging . Conclusion : 2GB ram is not enough for smooth experience . Though camera is lagging but the camera output is outstanding specially when we consider the price .

Camera is good . U can charge phone in 2 hours . And those who r saying the display quality is bad the camera is not good they should buy apple phone .

Phone looks and build quality is good . Screen resolution is not FHD . Elements and text looks big and zoomed . In a 6 inch + screen size it does not feel good . More over I think this model has some touch issues . I have to touch harder or multiple times to click an element . Hope Redmi fixes that via software update in future . Camera is average . Photos are good in sufficient lighting condition . Low light photos are not up to the mark . Battery seems ok . With my daily usage I am getting almost 2 days of battery life .

The call quality is terrible and the phone is already lagging very badly after 3 months . The user interface is something I personally hate as well .

The phone is very slow . I had used redmi products earlier and never expected this to be so slow . If possible would like to exchange it with a faster one by paying the difference amount .

I was looking for a slim and ligh 5G phone and it ' s more than my expections . Everything is superb . Battery back up is also good as it ' s 4250 MAH . It ' s fast recharge with 33wt is very good and I feel it ' s more than enough for anyone . I find this device , complete in all aspects . It ' s a superb 5G phone with HDR and 4K recording with 12 bands , it ' s with NFC too ( if u feel NFC feature would be helpful for you now and in future ) And dual speakers with dolby sound , what I was seaching badly in a slim light weight phone . Sound is also loud n clear . This is the only n only 5G mobile available in the market with all above features at this price . There is not any other in competition but inspite of that it ' s perfect . I ' m totally happy n satisfied and not find any cons till now since using last week . Highly recommended whose requirements are similar to mine . This is the only phone in this segment . For me it ' s a wow ! Amazing product at Amazon . Thanks . Superb , awesome phone , highly recommended for those whose requirements are as mine .

I got it for 18k and have no regrets , form factor build and software experience is pretty good .  First couple of days were a mess as I used to get a lot of ads in the mobile itself but after Miui update 13 all the ads gone away . It ' s like a clean slate as there are no junk apps now .  Display is crip and delight to watch , however in dark background scene you might notice some smudging of black which fine by me .  Best part is on performance it ' s top notch no lag or jitters at all and the device remains extremely cool I use it for hours while gaming and couldn ' t notice any warmth . . .  Battery is little less as compared to others but believe me even a 10 min charge can give you 40 % life so you don ' t feel the need for bigger one . You can easily get screen on time of more than 7 hours on balanced mode and 90hz####[['software', 'experience is pretty good', 'positive'], ['Miui update 13', 'all the ads gone away', 'positive'], ['Miui update 13', 'clean slate as there are no junk apps now', 'positive'], ['Display', 'crip', 'positive'], ['Display', 'delight to watch', 'positive'], ['Display', 'in dark background scene you might notice some smudging of black', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'little less', 'negative'], ['Battery', '10 min charge can give you 40 % life', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'got it for 18k and have no regrets', 'positive'], ['mobile', "performance it ' s top notch no lag", 'positive'], ['mobile', 'remains extremely cool', 'positive'], ['mobile', "use it for hours while gaming and couldn ' t notice any warmth", 'positive']]
Hello guys , I am using xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g from 1 week on wards my experience about this mobile in simple words this mobile fantastic to me . Actual I use this mobile browsing , watching YouTube movies , playing games small such as Cand crush , temple run . I suggest the guys who want to purchase this mobile better to use like professional purpose , because it ' s light weight phone and slim to . It gives better performance . It can also use as daily lifestyle mobile , coming to the battery performance right now for me it ' s perfect , Because I use this mobile as professional use . But I think if you ' re the player in the games such as big games like " PUBG " . I better suggest you choose bigger battery mobile . Thank you : )####[['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'fantastic', 'positive'], ['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'better to use like professional purpose', 'positive'], ['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'light weight', 'positive'], ['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'slim', 'positive'], ['xiaomi 11 lite ne 5g', 'better performance', 'positive'], ['battery performance', 'perfect', 'positive']]
This phone from Xiaomi 5G series is a excellent choice in terms of powerful performance . As the name suggests Xiaomi Lite NE 5G is solid in terms of design and features . The 64MP camera quality is simply stunning and exceptional .  The slimmest phone does the grand work when it comes to producing Dolby vision out of videos . The pictures seem larger than life in HD and add pure magic to absorb the visual elegance . All in all this phone provides all the pleasure in perfect ways to ride the experience of performance in cool avatar .####[['Xiaomi Lite NE 5G', 'excellent choice in terms of powerful performance', 'positive'], ['Xiaomi Lite NE 5G', 'solid in terms of design and features', 'positive'], ['64MP camera', 'quality is simply stunning and exceptional', 'positive'], ['Xiaomi Lite NE 5G', 'slimmest', 'positive'], ['Xiaomi Lite NE 5G', 'perfect ways to ride the experience of performance', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'Dolby vision out of videos', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'pictures seem larger than life in HD', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'pure magic to absorb the visual elegance', 'positive']]
1 . Great value for value 2 . Excellent phone slim and trim 3 . Rear camera is good in day light but in night camera doesn ' t perform well 4 . I don ' t like it ' s front camera it gives yellowish tint on my face . I have heard of gcam so I downloaded and installed it . The quality of image for selfies are far better than stock camera , I will recommend to use gcam for selfie . 5 . Battery backup is decent but this phone charges very quickly . 6 . Many people doesn ' t like miui interface but in my experience it is to good there are to many added features because of miui , yes it sometimes lags because of that but i am ok with it . 7 . Display quality is like of flagship phone . Beast in the industry . Only missing feature is on 120hz refresh rate . 8 .

Slim and weightless compared to all phone available . 90hz refresh rate is more than enough for those who are not in to heavy graphics games . And who are all not in games , this is an excellent choice which is a great value for money . One glitch for people who connect their phone to car Audio system for Android Auto or just thru USB , once you connect the phone to USB , the USB CONFIGERATION message would keep on flickering in the phone screen which will not allow to do anything untill you pull the USB off . After lot of googling , the only solution i could find is to use a less costly USB cable which does not supports quick charge . Understood XIAOMI doesn ' t care to sort this issue even lot of complaints to them . And so , if you are not in to connecting to Android Auto , music thru USB connection , this phone is an excellent choice with a luxurious look . Else , you will get irritated when u could not connect to your CAR music system .

Better not to choose it just for display . It really has a Black Crush Issue . But everything else is good especially its Design . Battery back is better than expected for 4250mah .

I am doctor . I required phone having good performance means reading books by pdf , hassle free internet access and to attend online meeting and class and having good camera quality .

I am writing this review after using phone for around six months . In terms of looks and design , phone looks great . Using this phone has exposed the reality of hypes created by xiaomi to buy its somewhat useless product . Xiaomi advertised as 10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision support for Netflix but these are either not usable or not existing at all . Being a phone with Amoled Display , I was expecting it to be True ALWAYS ON DISPLAY as shown in other Amoled phones of brands such as Samsung , Oneplus , Realme but here again Xiaomi cheated us and it can remain only for 10 seconds . Moreover , Xiaomi boasts of several long exposure modes but modes such as Light painting , Starry sky , Star trails etc cannot be used without a tripod . Xiaomi should have clearly written this in the product description rather than highlighting these modes to make people buy the product . After all this experience , I am not going to buy this THIRD CLASS Chinese brand phone ever again .####[['phone', 'looks great', 'positive'], ['xiaomi', 'useless product', 'negative'], ['10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision', 'not usable', 'negative'], ['10 bit Amoled and Dolby Vision', 'not existing at all', 'negative'], ['phone', 'THIRD CLASS', 'negative']]
There are white lines all over the display , when i am trying to put dark wallpaper , in contact app , phone dialer , basically anywhere there is grey or black background , so i have replaced the device i am hoping that this issue is only with my unit , this issue is very significant and visible , i have my finger crossed and hoping the new unit wont have this issue , rest the colors are very vibrant and display is very good in other cases , speakers are definitely great , battery is okay , works fine for a day , rest it would have been great if it was 4500mah battery , the design is really great , loved the back glass and texture , performance in day to day task is great but definitely not for gaming and i am kinda disappointed with it , cant even play genshin impact and this is not a budget device , so performance should have been better , pubg runs okay but frame drops , the phone is definitely not for gaming , but for a person who wants to consume media and day to day life it ' s great ! Finger print is good , and placement is also fine , dont have much complaints with the device but the issues i have mentioned are really problematic .####[['display', 'very good', 'positive'], ['speakers', 'definitely great', 'positive'], ['battery', 'okay', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'works fine for a day', 'positive'], ['phone', 'design is really great', 'positive'], ['phone', 'loved the back glass and texture', 'positive'], ['performance', 'day to day task is great but definitely not for gaming', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'not a budget device', 'negative'], ['performance', 'should have been bette', 'negative'], ['phone', 'definitely not for gaming', 'negative'], ['display', 'pubg runs okay but frame drops', 'negative'], ['Finger print', 'good', 'positive'], ['Finger print', 'placement is also fine', 'positive'], ['phone', 'really problematic', 'negative']]
This phone is great in terms of exchange value , sound quality through bluetooth and jack . physical aspect of slim phone and light weight frels great . However the displan has some bugs where black sesms greyish and dim black things in video are having no nights and it shows seprately . Its also called black crush issue .

After lot of search and reviews i purchased this mobile . Since I am using this mobile only for 3 days , i cannot put my full experience now . As of now camera performance is just ok and not as expected . Hope that camera performance will be improved by software updates by xioami . In my 3 days usage battery last for one day only on very moderate usage . Under heavy usage like shooting photos , videos , video streaming , little gaming , battery last for 4 to 5 hours only . Battery performance needs more optimization . Sound from speakers good . I felt little heating issues while charging , using cameras and sometimes playing videos . Only after a month of usage full pros and cons can be updated . At present only 3 star rating .####[['camera', 'performance is just ok', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'last for one day only on very moderate usage', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'last for 4 to 5 hours only', 'negative'], ['battery', 'performance needs more optimization', 'negative'], ['speakers', 'good', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'little heating issues', 'negative']]

Camera is good , it could be more better . Battery is only 4250 mah which is not running for a day also . In dark mode , mobile data is getting freeze , after talking to customer care , he told to reset or go to service center .

This review is after using it for 6 months . The worst product on Amazon and probably Xiaomi is aware of this failure . All 4 stars and 5 stars on Amazon are not at all genuine and so are the paid reviews on you tube . Major pixellation and black crush issue is seen when streaming videos on Netflix or you tube or any other OTT platform . Camera is below par . This is biggest let down . Very unstable , just good looks otherwise pure dabba phone not worth even 15k . Please dont waste your hard earned money on this product . I have sold this dabba phone from Xiaomi and will never buy any xioami phone again . Indians are not to be fooled .

The phone is beautiful and great to hold , especially with the thin profile . The screen is also decent and the cameras in the right lighting do take decent shots . But the core issue with this phone is the network issues , this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently . Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength , signal quality and signal type . I have tried Jio , Airtel & Vodafone in the last 9 months , all with similar issues but especially so with Jio . Being a phone , if it can ' t make calls reliably it ' s an abject failure . So I would rate ZERO but doing the least I can at one .####[['phone', 'beautiful', 'positive'], ['phone', 'great to hold', 'positive'], ['screen', 'decent', 'positive'], ['cameras', 'right lighting do take decent shots', 'positive'], ['phone', 'keep fluctuating with their signal strength', 'negative'], ['phone', 'network issues', 'negative'], ['phone', 'not able to sustain any network consistently', 'negative']]
Display is poor and text is not clear . Phone just hangs even if you ' re just minimising an app by pressing the home button . 6GB RAM ( and RAM expansion ) is a joke as it only hangs and the moment you switch to an app it always reloads the data / page . Imagine trying to copy the OTP from a msg and when you go back to the page to enter it , it reloads ! Haven ' t seen a worse phone than this . Extremely poor RAM management . Typing / Keyboard isn ' t smooth , camera hangs everytime you open the camera app plus camera quality is poor , battery drains extremely fast , calling problems . My old phone works better than this . Their Customer Care is a joke , so good luck trying to get this faulty device exchanged . Final verdict - Avoid buying this .

It ' s almost 1 year and 8 months and the smartphone is working average . I do experience some crashes but ig I can bear that much in exchange of AMOLED screen and better camera + fast charging . I am using this smartphone for AMV and the softwares I use are Node Video and Alight motion which are sometimes the heaviest apps in my smartphone but I can get 1080p so it ' s ok .

Perfect phone for its price . Saw some bad reviews , but may I know do they expect a phone quality in this price range ? ? For the price it ' s a good phone with g95 processor and getting to play BGMI with extreme settings . I haven ' t got any sort of issue till now . Not that much of heating , but while gaming there will be heating obviously . . . Camera is good as we get till 4k 30fps video recording and a 64 mp camera . What else should we get in this price .

I purchased this phone for my father and he is very happy with it . He has motibindu the amoled display is great for it plus it has ip57 rating 5000mh battery it easy last 2 and half day so you know his usage . And 33w charger is excellent in an hour it full charges . Camera is great but he rarely takes photos he uses ultra wide only . MIUI is fine I have disable all the ads and finally no bloatware in the phone out of the box so it is great news . Only issue is software update if redmi fix it then I have no problem with MIUI . I wanted to switch him to samsung but he is used to MIUI . But it was difficult to adjust for it so I made decision to stick with MIUI .####[['5000mh battery', 'easy last 2 and half day', 'positive'], ['amoled display', 'great for it plus it has ip57 rating', 'positive'], ['33w charger', 'excellent in an hour it full charges', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'great', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'fine', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'disable all the ads and finally no bloatware', 'positive'], ['MIUI', 'Only issue is software update', 'negative']]
Battery on stand by with minimal usage lasts quite long . I would charge it in the morning at 90 % , and after 12 hours it would come down only to 80 - 85 % . But if I use it heavily on phone calls , Netflix , Brave , Youtube , etc . then I may have to charge it after a few hours since the battery would come down to 20 - 30 % . This is compensated by Fast charging which is really great . I would charge my phone for give or take 30 - 40 minutes and it would be fully charged from 10 - 20 % to 90 - 100 . Fingerprint scanner works quite well . Saved me a lot from embarrassing pocket dialing people . Sound quality of the stereo is really good . Quite loud and doesn ' t crack on full volume . The earphone jack is on the bottom of the phone near the charging point . I find it quite impractical if I want to put the phone vertically but I also find it convenient if I have to charge my phone and use it at the same time with the headphones connected . It is also quite convenient for me to just slide the phone " head " first in and out of my pocket when listening to music .####[['Battery', 'minimal usage lasts quite long', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'Fast charging which is really great', 'positive'], ['Fingerprint scanner', 'works quite well', 'positive'], ['Sound quality', 'really good', 'positive'], ['stereo', 'Quite loud', 'positive'], ['stereo', "doesn ' t crack on full volume", 'positive'], ['earphone jack', 'quite impractical', 'positive']]
Good phone at this price range . If you need a smart phone for its smart features for using it for studies or communication or professional / personal communication . This is a great one . The location of the fingerprint scanner ( on the power button ) is not ideal if you are a left handed person or if the phone is fixed on a mobile stand or a car phone holder . Not a negative but point to remember that there is no NFC or wireless charging feature####[['smart phone', 'Good phone at this price range', 'positive'], ['smart phone', 'smart features', 'positive'], ['smart phone', 'great one', 'positive'], ['fingerprint scanner', 'on the power button ) is not ideal', 'negative']]
The phone is really good and great value for money , easy to use and quite legible . Performance is not really a ask for me as it is an gift to my mom . She does a lot of binge watching of soaps and TV Shows , the screen looks big and phone looks very premium . Good build quality and the finger print sensor works well . The only issue is the speakers , they could have been louder . Considering my mom watches lot of video on this , the audio is not so great and i need to have add on software to blare the music , I am sure that is not good for the speaker . Eventually had to buy a good quality headphone . Cameras are decent but need a little experienced hand to get good pics , not something that my mom can use to take good quality pics .####[['phone', 'really good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'great value for money', 'positive'], ['phone', 'easy to use', 'positive'], ['phone', 'quite legible', 'positive'], ['screen', 'looks big', 'positive'], ['phone', 'looks very premium', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Good build quality', 'positive'], ['finger print sensor', 'works well', 'positive'], ['speakers', 'audio is not so great', 'negative'], ['Cameras', 'decent', 'positive']]
I initially felt bad about you the product looking at the negative reviews . However took a decision to buy and try . Phone is worthy every penny . I got it around 13k . Great battery , works atleast 2 days for normal usage with internet all day . Didn ' t try gaming . Decent 64mp camera and great audio with dual speakers . Refresh rate is also good . No lags . I m using this smartphone from almost 5 months and have not seen any issues . Best budget phone . All mobiles with similar specs will cost you minimum of 14 to 15k . General users can simply go for it . I suggest buy this phone in offers or sales which would give you some additional discount .####[['Phone', 'worthy every penny', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Great', 'positive'], ['battery', 'works atleast 2 days for normal usage', 'positive'], ['64mp camera', 'Decent', 'positive'], ['dual speakers', 'great audio', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'Best budget', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'General users can simply go for it', 'positive'], ['Refresh rate', 'good', 'positive'], ['Refresh rate', 'No lags', 'positive']]
The phone was hyped so much during launch . It is similar to ordinary mi phones . If you are searching a gaming phone , don ' t go for this . . After heavy gaming uses the phone will start lagging in normal operations also . The phone us having issues during software updates . My phone started rebooting during software update and i had to wipe all data to make the phone working . Lost all my data . . The camera is normal similar to other phone camera .

I bought it in 14999 / but in offline stores , it is easily available in 14000 . Never buy android 11 phones if you need to record calls . Android 11 is as worst as first release of windows 11 . Camera of this phone is below average , as usual in case of Xiomi . If you ' re purchasing it for camera or for battery or for looks , simple go for samsung . Even vivo cameras are worst nowadays ( xiomi was never in the race ) . It may look like less in weight but don ' t go with the sight it is heavy af . Only good thing about this phone is fast charging . If you want to buy a fast charger in 15 thousands then go for this phone . I repeat never buy fkn Redmi , it freezes worst then the water in refrigerator after 2 years .####[['Android 11', 'worst', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'below average', 'negative'], ['Xiomi', 'as usual in case', 'negative'], ['Xiomi', 'never in the race', 'negative'], ['phone', 'heavy', 'negative'], ['charging', 'fast', 'positive'], ['phone', 'freezes worst', 'negative'], ['Xiomi', 'repeat never buy', 'negative']]
Firstly , the phone is in this price range is awesome with sAmoled display . Display quality is very good but less brighter than Samsung ' s amoled panels . I can ' t recommend you this phone for Pubg , COD gaming because after 15 min this phone was heating like an iron with remarkable frame drops but day to day use and it would be okay to use . I ' m not going to tell about bugs because it ' s MIUI ' s issue and will be solve with update . But battery is not like 5000 mAh , its display and android system is consuming too much brightness . Camera is good but sometimes colour is gone fade but you can use google camera for good portraits and to taking natural colour images ( here some clicks I have taken ) . By the way , its my honest review after using 8 days . You must buy this according to your criteria . But Xiaomi should cake immediate steps to solve these problems especially bettery , bugs , lagging and heating issues .

Got this phone bacause of 2 main reasons over narzo 30 5g , one is good design , looks and display , second is IP53 rating . . . Almost satisfied except battery life and software issues . . . Battery draining very fast , and google chrome is not working well , crashing ever time I use google search , heavy notifications from miui . . Disappointed for these . . . Overall if you are concerned about 5g future ready , fastness in processor just avoid it . . Else ok to buy and install other browsers and bear with notifications , I m not talking about camera . . For this price range in any phone we won ' t get good camera , for 10s also it is not good , but I don ' t use camera often and not concerned about it . .####[['phone', 'good design', 'positive'], ['phone', 'looks', 'positive'], ['phone', 'IP53 rating', 'positive'], ['display', 'Almost satisfied', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'draining very fast ', 'negative'], ['software', 'google chrome is not working well ', 'negative'], ['software', 'crashing ever time', 'negative'], ['software', 'Disappointed', 'negative'], ['phone', 'concerned about 5g future ready', 'negative'], ['phone', 'fastness in processor just avoid', 'negative']]
I don ' t understand why it was so hyped I bought it by reading the reviews but it turned out to be a waste of money it ' s not at all good phone selfie camera is the worst one and back camera I didn ' t expect this from this phone . . Or may be i have received a defective or refurbished product I don ' t know that but i felt cheated on this particular phone from amazone . Earlier I bought realme from flipkart which has better quality picture although the camera pixel were not like this phone . . 64 mp . .

If anyone want to buy this phone , let me clearly tell you that camera quality is worst . I bought and cant even comparing camera quality to any other same range smartphone . Look wise its ok , battery life is also 18 hour if use continue . Screen is good , sometime hang issue occurs . In terms of other features , its average phone . But if anyone wants to take good quality photo or video , then its not worth to invest in this phone .####[['camera quality', 'worst', 'negative'], ['battery life', '18 hour if use continue', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Look wise its ok', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'sometime hang issue occurs', 'negative'], ['phone', 'average', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'not worth to invest in this', 'negative']]
Phone is slow to read memory card and also to access camera . While open the camera , you may ashamed off infront of a group of people bcz of slow . I won ' t suggest to my friends . Display and main camera are good . Front protection glass is poor quality . Battery ok . Macro not good as expected . Compared to my 6years old Lenovo k4note ( dual Dolby speakers ) sound quality and speed also NOT impressed me . I hope a 1gb ram sufficient for our daily use except game , but this 4gb struggle to do our needs bcz of third party Mi User Interface disturbance .

Writing this review almost after 1 . 5 year of buying this phone . Becauss This is the worst mobile experience I ever had , it hangs toooo toooo much . It is hanging right from day one , It hangs even while receiving a call , opening any application or doing anything , I don ' t know why this is happened but I bought this phone because earlier I had good experience of using redmi phones .

I bought this product thinking so that it will sum up all the things the display is very much clear and pleasant you can get all the colours even in sunlight but the thing here I was the disappointed with the camera the cameras are not very cool the front camera is specially it ' s not of worthy even when you take a selfie the sky colour is blue it will make it as a white colour where is in the rear camera the bokeh effect ( potrait ) can ' t be seen , if two persons are standing near by it will make only first person cleared the rest of other unclear the battry was quite good and the phone heating problem was not an issue design is elegant phone look premium 1 , but the only thing which should all be looking to it ' s the camera quality the can give to camera in note 10 but they can ' t give a good camera in note 10s this is one of the cons which are not understood and I return this product and one more thing which I like to tell is that it ' s as refresh rate 60 hz but it ' s not performing as same so there is a jitteriness falling in the the screen .####[['display', 'very much clear', 'positive'], ['display', 'get all the colours even in sunlight', 'positive'], ['camera', 'disappointed', 'negative'], ['camera', 'not very cool', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'not of worthy', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'a selfie the sky colour is blue it will make it as a white colour', 'negative'], ['rear camera', "bokeh effect ( potrait ) can ' t be seen", 'negative'], ['battry', 'quite good', 'positive'], ['note 10s', 'design is elegant', 'positive'], ['note 10s', 'look premium', 'positive'], ['note 10s', 'heating problem was not an issue', 'positive'], ['camera quality', "can ' t give a good", 'negative'], ['note 10s', 'return this product', 'negative'], ['display', "refresh rate 60 hz but it ' s not performing", 'negative'], ['display', 'jitteriness falling', 'negative']]

I bought the 6 / 128 GB version . It ' s working quite well . I ' ve too many apps installed , up and running , but it ' s still performing smooth . The primary camera also takes some good pictures .

It served the purpose for which I purchased this phone . I was looking for a phone that is 5G ready , and after a few searches , I got a recommendation for this product .

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device .

When this is a camera highlighted phone , the camera should have been far better . The camera does not capture good shot at all , in the case of moving objects it can not get much worse than this phone . The back of the orange one is getting heavily dirtier . Because of accidental touch sensibility the screen gets awake which is very much disturbing .

Let me start with positive . The only thing you will like in this phone is memory and that ' s it . Camera picture quality is average . Touch is average . Now , negative . Battery backup is poor . Even when you put single jio sim battery lasts for couple of hours . If you use social media apps it will drain within hour . OS is slow . Screen size is small in this prize range . Overall its not worth it . I believe I did mistake buying it .

This is really worst phone that I have a boy but due to respect and frame of jio I buy this phone but this really didn ' t match my expectations and its really battery life is really worst than ever expected even a feature phone could have a better battery life and it ' s having a problem in my unit if I say in my device it ' s automatically get switch off and restarts it ' s own whether I am using a call or using a social media####[['phone', 'really worst', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'really worst', 'negative'], ['phone', "automatically get switch off and restarts it ' s own", 'negative']]
I am a traveller and often go on long treks and hence wanted a durable phone that also had long lasting battery life . I was going on a trek and the C11 is the only phone i took with me and i have to say i was very very impressed especially with the battery life . Generally during trek we don ' t get much access to plug ports hence i wanted a long battery life and the phone gave me just that , and when i turned on power saving mode was the best , this one week , i ran the phone without charging for 4 days .####[['battery life', 'very very impressed', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'long', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'without charging for 4 days', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'power saving mode was the best', 'positive']]
Have been looking for a phone to start online classes for my children , was looking for something afforable but also something that can do daily work very well and can play some games also . The C11 was a complete surprise , because i have been looking for some time and couldn ' t quite find a good fit , but after i saw the C11 2021 , i thought it would be great and after using for about 2 weeks , my children are very happy with it . And due to the low cost i was able to buy two for an affordable price and still get good performance .####[['C11', 'complete surprise', 'positive'], ['C11', 'great', 'positive'], ['C11', 'low cost', 'positive'], ['C11', 'affordable price', 'positive'], ['C11', 'good performance', 'positive']]
Have been looking for a phone for my parents and my aunt at my hometown and wanted an affordable and good option . The features that i got with this phone i was not expecting to see , in fact i saw some Samsung phones before and Redmi but the features did not match or maybe display was too small . This phone has a big display and good performance with decent camera performance and for this price I don ' t think i could ' ve asked for anything more .####[['display', 'big', 'positive'], ['phone', 'good performance', 'positive'], ['camera performance', 'decent', 'positive'], ['price', "could ' ve asked for anything more", 'positive']]
realme with android software on this is very smooth , I was mainly buying it for my father , but the software is surprisingly good and fast in use .

Its been almost 1month , and I use this for daily purpose . Sometimes feels lag , and does not shutdown or restart properly , gets hanged in the middle of important task .

All smartphone features working as per the budget . Can be a good first smart phone for elderly switching from basic mobile to smart phone . For sure features are not as good as 12 - 13k phone but for this budget good enough . So if budget permits go for 12k + phone with same features but better performance . Missing finger print scanner is the feature I feel would have made this more worthy as face scan works less than 50 % of the time . Battery lasts more than a day with moderate use .

If someone is calling to my number on the phone it used to rejected automatically , Initially , i thought it was my network issue , i tried with some other SIM and found this is mobile problem .

Although this product I buied from outside retailer on urgent need , the phone is quality worst at such price , instead redmi offers best quality phone at same price , and I am using redmi phone since 2 years , No network speed indicator , camera quality is very poor for selfi and long shots and no beauty mode , pictures pixels gets muddy effects no pre installed gallery , no private mode , battery is not so good .

I ordered this phone and after 5 - 6 days it started lagging . The camera quality is also not so good as well as I can ' t do many things in this phone because it ' s not meant for all the AI and other functions too .

I just got the phone today and experienced an unexpected event today . The phone was fine , nothing special about it .

Best iPhone from Apple . Display , camera , video quality is top notch . Any other mobile can’t match up to iPhone 14 pro max .

Worth is subjective and differs from person to person . I’m not sure why everyone keeps comparing this to previous year iPhone as normal people usually upgrade from 2 or 3 generations .

As always , samsung disappointed me again , i purchased this phone because of the new processor which had scored 4 lakh + in antutu . But it doesnt work well , camera is very bad , bezzels are really big , and due to its thickness if i put back cover on it becomes really bulky . I wont suggest anyone to buy this .

Don ' t take this mobile if you intend to use the hotspot feature . The other devices you connect to it will lose connection so often that it is frustrating .

Hello all , I ' ve been using this phone for past couple of days . It ' s an excellent phone to use with . Performance is fantastic followed by the battery life . I ' m not a core gamer , I am getting battery life of 48 hours . User interface is excellent , the processor is super fine . The camera isn ' t splendid , however does the job . Overall it ' s a very good performance driven phone , which fulfils the daily need . Kudos to the 160 W charger , it charges the phone in 15 minutes . I ' m enjoying it .

I have been a royal one plus customer , started with One plus 3T . My last phone was One plus 8T , though I missed the alert slider for 2 days . . . now i got used to it so it was not a big con for me . The major uplift from 8T was charging time 100percent in 20mins . . . was mindblown and then a good level up in the camera segment too . Was little hesitant about the phone back panel , but in hand it looks gorgeous with curved camera segment and a premium finish . Was impressed when One plus gave me a 160W charger in box unlike IPhone ( Pun intended ) , and also a jade green silicone back cover which I ' m currently using due to unavailability of cover due to new model release . Applications are opening blazing fast and no heating issues when I played Asphalt and PUBG mobile .

Everything is but bgmi game lacks in frame drops in this device maybe it ' s due to its ban in India as of my thoughts and I have noticed that like all the flagship this mobile is getting some what heat after using for continuously for even 30mins but compared to all flagship mobile brands it is heating 50 % less over all a performance beast with a superb charger Main Camera sensor is at its best regarding that two other cams were not up to the mark and Stereo Speakers were best but not as best as Harmon kardon speakers of Xiamoi mobile .####[['Stereo Speakers', 'best', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'bgmi game lacks in frame drops', 'negative'], ['mobile', 'heating 50 % less', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'performance beast', 'positive'], ['charger', 'superb', 'positive']]
A rare combination of high - end specs delivering a stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS . I was not expecting such a blistering performance from an Android device . Although there are few compromises on the hardware front such as removal of alert slider button , it ' s certainly not a deal breaker . The design of the phone is not pathbreaking , but actually could differentiate from other me - too phones . The unique camera setup helps to differentiate this phone with others . It ' s a kind of proprietary design for One Plus 10 series . The photos come good if not excellent . I could buy it at 36k with ICICI bank CC offer , combined with an exchange . At 36k it ' s a steal for sure . If you are looking for a real fast phone , has a decent 6 . 7 inch - 120 Hz screen , a unique look to flaunt , One Plus 10T presents itself as a worthy option to consider .####[['One Plus 10T', 'rare combination of high - end specs', 'positive'], ['One Plus 10T', 'stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS', 'positive'], ['One Plus 10T', 'blistering performance', 'positive'], ['hardware', 'removal of alert slider button', 'negative'], ['hardware', 'few compromises', 'negative'], ['One Plus 10T', 'design of the phone is not pathbreaking', 'neutral'], ['camera setup', 'unique', 'positive'], ['photos', 'come good if not excellent', 'neutral'], ['One Plus 10T', "36k it ' s a steal for sure", 'positive'], ['One Plus 10T', 'real fast', 'positive'], ['screen', 'decent 6 . 7 inch - 120 Hz', 'positive'], ['One Plus 10T', 'unique look to flaunt', 'positive'], ['One Plus 10T', 'worthy option to consider', 'positive']]
It is a decent phone . Battery discharge quickly and you have to charge it . it takes just 10 to 15 mins to charge . Thanks to super voc 150w adapter .

didn ' t expect this from one plus . After one month of use the phone started showing some issues mostly in network issue and always having a issue while the time of attending phone calls .

Upgraded from my Mi4i to Note 4 , and so it was familiar terrain ! As always , with the 4GB RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage , it was huge leap forwards in online actions and applications . The touch sensitivity is excellent and the camera remains a strong feature for me . The only negatives I felt were an element of heating on continuous use and longer battery charging time . Overall , for me , a total value for money piece , considering that it was combined with an exchange offer plus cash discount on card - truly " Price Less " ! !####[['touch', 'sensitivity is excellent', 'positive'], ['camera', 'strong feature', 'positive'], ['Note 4', 'element of heating on continuous use', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'battery charging time', 'positive'], ['Note 4', 'total value for money piece', 'positive']]
Redmi Note 4 remains a very popular obile phone and was the most popular in 2017 . However with the passage of time the front camera need update and the software becomes slow . The primary problem with such Chinese origin phones is their reluctance to learn from Apple . The hardware remains an issue and these phones are primarily targetting the Lower Middle Class segment who constitute the bulk of Mobile set consumers in India at present . Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi must develop in this aspect .####[['Redmi Note 4', 'very popular', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'need update', 'negative'], ['software', 'becomes slow', 'negative'], ['hardware', 'remains an issue', 'negative']]

Only go for this device if you want a budget gaming phone and cant extend your budget beyond 12k . I am happy with overall performance but i dont like hios . if you have used miui or any other with great customization then you will be disappointed with hios . hios doesnt even provide some basic customiztion of change your app drawer look . And if you r thinking of installing custom rom after warrenty expires then also you will be disappointed as tecno device dont have any custom rom support . Now I am not happy with this device . Wish i had gone with poco , the only reason i didnt go for poco is their poor updates and mothorboard issues . And sames goes for this phone not sure whether it will receive any updates .

1 . Dual speakers are not giving overall good quality sound . Only one speaker is working properly , the other one is having very low sound as compared with first one . 2 .

Using this from 7 days now ( 8gb 128gb variant , black ) Like : good refresh rate , display is nice , camera is average , ram 8gb plus booster 3gb available , charges quickly around 40mins full charge , no heating issues . Dislike : the phone sound system is extremely low , it ' s speaker seems so less in volume . My redmi note 7 pro has got better speaker than this . Despite giving full volume I can hardly hear the ringtone a room apart , if I place this phone in full volume in my bag I cannot hear the ring even a bit , same is the case with alarm tone , speaker during the call .

The product comes with lots of promises . While it certainly has good functional features , in terms of camera and battery life , the manufacturer have compromised a lot in terms of durability . Its highly fragile and comes with high risk of screen damage with slightest of shock or fall . Worst part , since its a new model , the service team does not even have spare parts to fix the same . I am having horrible experience in getting the screen replaced which is already delayed by a week now which has never been the case with Samsung .

Very pathetic camera . Over heating outdoor in the normal Indian temperature . I have captured the video with my another phone outside the service centre . After they gave me an advice that i must use the phone inside the house when AC is on . As well as keep the Wi - Fi , and other options off while using the phone camera . Service center will not solve your problem . I got it back . I shoot the video in front of the service centre . It was about 11 o ' clock morning , normal temperature around 35 degrees .  It ' s completely waste of money . My old Motorola working fine . No such issues . But this one is garbage . I won ' t recommend anyone to by this phone .

If you need an iOS device at low price , go for it . For camera freaks not recommended if you are into telephoto clicks because it doesn ' t have a telephoto lens . But best in its class . I do remember it had the best camera after after pixel 2 xl and huawei p30 pro . Good battery life . Gets you through the day with moderate use but do buy a 20 w charger . Ahead of times processor , no question about that . Screen goes upto 1080p 60hz , not recommended if you use a 120 / 90hz device already , you will get stuck at slow motion . nice speakers if you still listen to music on speaker . . . it has that iconic punch of a little base that every iPhone has . But I do recommend to go for the higher variants if not necessarily an emergency to have an iOS device .

जब आप अपने हाथ में iPhone पकड़ते हैं तो यह वास्तव में एक प्रीमियम अहसास होता है और मुझे यह पसंद है। कैमरा एकमात्र निराशा है कुल मिलाकर कम बैटरी क्षमता, यदि आप एक Android उपयोगकर्ता हैं और iPhone से iPhone 11 पर स्विच कर रहे हैं, तो आपको चिप A13 बायोनिक में नाइट मोड और डुअल कैमरा शक्तिशाली मिलेगा। यदि आपसे पूछा जाए कि क्या iPhone 11 2022 में उपयोगी है तो मेरा उत्तर बहुत उपयोगी है क्योंकि भारत में इस साल 5G नहीं आ रहा है और यदि आपका बजट ज्यादा समस्या नहीं है तो आपको iPhone 4G खरीदने के लिए लंबा इंतजार करना होगा। iphone 12 के लिए जाएं क्योंकि iphone 12 2022 में पैसे के लिए सबसे अच्छा मूल्य प्रदान करता है। यह मेरी राय है धन्यवाद####[]
I have used iPhone 11 since 3month It gives me a smooth experience with beautiful premium feel and good Camera quality . iPhone 11 runs one day very easily ( I’m a medium to moderate user ) .

As for now It is a best value for money iPhone . If you want to experience iphone with a modern looks you should go for this . If camera is not your number one priority then it will be a good choice for you . Dont get me wrong . Camera of iPhone xr is good enough but you will not get wide angle shots so if potrait and wide angle shots are your priority then go for iPhone 11 instead .

This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get ( Bought in amazon sale ) for this price . I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving . Think twice if you’re making switch from android , coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations . Man you’ll feel android is cheap ( except oxygen and pure android ) , that fluidity , damn the haptic motor ( sucks in most of androids ) . Here comes the big surprise for me , the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except . It gives you 1 and half to two days of normal usage . It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast .

iPhones are the most premium mobile devices money can buy . If u have a budget just go for it , You won’t regret it . Coming to iPhone 11 it’s the most affordable of the lot and feels really premium . Though it’s not 5G but it doesn’t matter 5G won’t be coming anytime soon and even if it comes it would be very expensive so one can easily go for it . Coming to the lcd screen trust me won’t notice any difference it’s Apple quality LCD and the company would not compromise on quality . Camera is best especially in the low light performance is really impressive . And coming to the battery life it’s really impressive on moderate uses u can easily get 8 + hours of screen on time .####[['iPhone 11', 'most premium', 'positive'], ['iPhone 11', 'most affordable of the lot', 'positive'], ['iPhone 11', 'feels really premium', 'positive'], ['lcd screen', 'won’t notice any difference', 'positive'], ['Apple', 'company would not compromise on quality', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'best especially in the low light performance is really impressive', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'really impressive on moderate uses', 'positive']]
Amazing phone but as the other reviews say , yes it has heating issues but you won’t get to know if you have a thick back cover . Battery life is average , not too good not too bad .

Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed . . its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick , camera quality is top notch , battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet####[['NULL', 'delivery was quick', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'box was a little discoloured', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'otherwise everything was fine and sealed', 'positive'], ['camera', 'quality is top notch', 'positive'], ['battery', 'lasts for a whole day for heavy user', 'positive'], ['mobile', 'haven’t face any issues yet', 'positive']]
Bought the iPhone few days . Actually after seeing the white colour I felt had to order different colour though , but it’s fine as long as ur using cover it doesn’t matter . Coming to looks it’s average as described earlier and battery back up is really good . Camera quality is just good no doubt in that . Very crisp , sharp and colours are defined well .

This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone . The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android . And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is . It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone . Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience , you can’t beat the iPhone . I say go for this phone without any hesitation .####[['NULL', 'experience of ios is so rich', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'how easy and intuitive it', 'positive'], ['phone', 'enjoying every moment using this', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'go for this phone without any hesitation', 'positive']]
Charging cable quality v poor . Battery is good but not for a whole busy day with all its features . Its terrible thing is , some heating issues while fast charging and heavy using but this could be managed .

Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this .

I bought this phone for my brother . He said that this product is getting heated a lot . He checked the serial number in Apple site and the product is genuine . I am using iPhone from iphone 3g almost 11 years . No issues like heat or anything else . I bought those phones from directly Apple US . He will check with Apple . Another guy is using 11 and no heat issue for him . I am not sure if this lot has issue .

Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8 .

I don’t think the quality of phone is good . Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store . The phone hangs few times everyday . Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well .

This is amazing phone under 60k . Good display . And usage u won ' t get any lag . Funtouch os is good but need small improvements . Camera department is awesome . Selfie camera is good . I attached one file with back camera . Battery is good . Last 1 day for an moderate user . But for heavy users need to charge again in the evening . It becomes hot while charging and it takes 25 mins for full charge .  Overall it is agood phone under 60k with all flagship features . Better than high range samsung and iPhone in value for money .

The display is really good and the charging speed is also as advertised but the battery seems to be discharging quickly than expected . I charged it at 85 % and it discharged to 70 % by the end of the day on standby . The battery optimization could have been better .

Previously i had oppo find X2 which was 10x better than this . Battery lasts for long but can ' t use for long continuous .

I won ' t suggest anyone to buy this phone . I had seen many reviews before buying this but the price and performance didn ' t turnout to be reasonable .

I upgraded from iphone xs and I am pretty happy with it . The feature it provide are only present in iPhone pro models which are above 1 . 2 lakhs currently . The best thing is battery charging speed around 25 min for full charge and it can stay for 1 day normally . The screen resolution and adaptive refresh rate is also a plus . I am not a camera fan but it captures great night shots . With 4 years OS update and 5 years security update and wifi 7 update are the best things the company is offering . In Love with this mobile .

xcellent device for the price . I ' m writing this stubby review and will use it as a running log to report the good and bad about the device . Until now , the phone feels great ! Definitely feels like the old OnePlus of yore , and the good part , thankfully .  The handfeel is very good , it masks the weight and size of the device , designed quite well .  It ' s a joy to type on ( fabulous haptics ! ) .  The screen is really good .  The battery life seems to be holding up well ( using on qHD + 120hz ) .  It did heat up during the initial setup but calmed right down after a while . Not heatup up during normal usage .

Apart from a couple of bugs that I noticed in my daily usage , this seems like an outstanding phone . Nothing that cannot go away with an OTA update or two . Charging speed is insane and battery life won ' t let you down . Camera is decent enough for clicking pictures . I am not into vlogging so I don ' t really bother about the front camera capabilities of not being able to record a 4K video . Sound is loud and crisp . UI is highly customisable and I keep it the way I like .

After couple of days after receiving the phone , the volume down button stops working and the lower part of the button went inside the phone and the day later the volume up button stopped working as well , I don ' t understand if it ' s the phone defected or it ' s the OnePlus build quality . If it ' s the OnePlus build quality that is dropped then surely OnePlus should improve a lot in that because I have been using 1 + 7 T from 3 years and I have never seen any issue with that and it had bent and shattered and still it works .

1 . Battery consumption is too much . 2 . Worse experience on google photos , youtube , games .

Pathetic camera experience . Photos and videos taken by oneplus 11 is over sharpened and also having unrealistic color processing by default photo app . Don ' t know what Hasselblad collaboration is actually delivering . I have been using oneplus 5 for last six years and a happy customer , but after buying oneplus 11 my expectation on oneplus phone has gone down . Even old oneplus 5 is taking much better photo / video than this high cost nonsense product . Today mobile phone is used for taking pictures and videos to capture great memories , and oneplus is failed to deliver satisfactory results . Those who are buying this phone for photography , then don ' t spend your valuable money for oneplus 11 , instead think for others .####[['camera', 'Pathetic', 'negative'], ['camera', 'over sharpened', 'negative'], ['camera', 'unrealistic color processing by default photo app', 'negative'], ['oneplus 11', 'expectation on oneplus phone has gone down', 'negative'], ['oneplus 11', 'high cost nonsense product', 'negative'], ['oneplus', 'failed to deliver satisfactory results', 'negative'], ['oneplus 11', "don ' t spend your valuable money", 'negative']]
I thought it would be a good phone for the next 3 to 5 years . But I am facing an issue with Wi - Fi connectivity . Even though it gets connected to Wi - Fi , the network activity is zero . Also facing issue with recording calls . I haven ' t tested the camera completely , but with the reviews that I read , looks like the camera set up is disappointing . Battery life is average , and with the fast charger , one can charge 0 % to 100 % in 20 mins , so the battery is not of a concern . Screen is not dazzling . But overall I am disappointed with the phone because of the Wi - Fi connectivity and recording calls .####[['Wi - Fi connectivity', 'facing an issue', 'negative'], ['Wi - Fi connectivity', 'network activity is zero', 'negative'], ['recording calls', 'facing issue', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'average', 'neutral'], ['fast charger', '0 % to 100 % in 20 mins', 'positive'], ['battery', 'not of a concern', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'not dazzling', 'positive'], ['phone', 'disappointed', 'negative']]

The product delivers what it says and is completely worth the asking price of < 9k . Display , processor and storage are really good ( and fast 90hz & UFS 2 . 2 ) .

After using this phone for 3 days , I realised the phone is pretty good ok this segment under 10k . However , I totally understand that we can ' t expect a very good camera as somewhere the company needs to compromise . The camera is good during daylight but in night time there are grains . . I tried the pro mode and if you know it well you can use the same camera to reduce the grains . Also , gyroscope is not there so for PuBg people who plays it via gyro . . . . . it ' s a no no  Otherwise it ' s good in this series . . . .####[['phone', 'pretty good ok this segment under 10k', 'positive'], ['camera', 'good during daylight', 'positive'], ['camera', 'night time there are grains', 'negative'], ['gyroscope', 'not there so for PuBg', 'negative']]

Overall it ' s a good quality phone . The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil / moisture all over the box . But i guess it didn ' t affect the phone . I have been using it for over a week . The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it . Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note . My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps , and i send it over WhatsApp . . . the video gets compressed so much that it ' s laggy and unwatchable . Overall . .

Overall the phone is great with beautiful display great inhand feel great haptics . But the battery life in my 4 day usage is average . I don ' t know if this will be fixed via updates or not but till now it ' s not very good . I had a 4000 mah phone last and it lasted thr same as this maybe it ' s because of the processor or thr refresh rate but it should be improved via updates . Other than that the phone ' s really great and if you are an average user the battery will last the whole day easily so not so bad either . I don ' t use cameras that much so can ' t really comment on that but so far looks really good and the limited photos I have clicked have come out great .

Overall its an awesome phone , good camera , awesome display and overall design but the let down is the battery life . . . lasts only 4 - 5 hours with decent use . . so basically you ' ll have to charge it twice in a day . The other issue is heating . . . i know 8 gen 1 is known for heating but this phone heats even on using lighter apps like teams , insta .

I bought the cream version and it looks very premium . Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k . But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake . Coming to phone , the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT / 17 hrs in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel , chrome , and social media apps . Dont play games , so dont know the performance . But its buttery smooth . Outdoor brightness is exceptional . It is joy to watch videos on this on display . Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording . Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option , 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5 % to 1 % within like 5 mins .####[['NULL', 'got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'decent', 'positive'], ['Oneplus 11', 'buttery smooth', 'positive'], ['display', 'Outdoor brightness is exceptional', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'excellent', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'very good portraits', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'night time shots with 60fps recording', 'positive'], ['charging', 'slow', 'negative'], ['battery life', 'dies from 5 % to 1 % within like 5 mins', 'negative']]
Camera too good . Display is dope af . Feels super nice to hold . Flagship experience all around . One small con is the camera arrangement , one below the other , hand touches the cam sometimes , will get used to it in a few days , plus and ultra won ' t have this issue because the size is bigger I guess . Battery is just decent but still way better than s22 .  Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low , even in the morning . Could use night mode to get better pictures . Relies a lot on post processing of the image . Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on . Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better . In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing . 4k 60fps videos are too fiire , screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images . Ton of detail . Stabilization is excellent .

I liked almost every aspecf of this phone . It is premium , easy to hold considering the screen size , reminds me of iPhone 5s but that was smaller . Slick , swift and perfectly configured . I might say that this phone looks even better than some of the iPhonesin the market ( of course those are way more premium and well put together ) . I think Samsung got jt all right this time as the elegant flat back and a very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera and refresh rates and the chip . . display and camera have been the forte but they went one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality .####[['phone', 'Slick', 'positive'], ['phone', 'swift', 'positive'], ['phone', 'perfectly configured', 'positive'], ['phone', 'elegant flat back', 'positive'], ['phone', 'very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera', 'positive'], ['display', 'forte', 'positive'], ['camera', 'forte', 'positive'], ['phone', 'one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality', 'positive'], ['phone', 'easy to hold', 'positive']]

Writing this review after 1 month of using this device . Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality , feels premium . Software experience has been good so far no bugs , smooth UI . The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup , it doesn ' t last whole day . Gives about 6 - 7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data . Battery performance could have been better as Samsung ' s mid - range phones are really good at battery backup . When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over - saturated , night mode pics are not that great feels over - exposed almost all the time .####[['Phone', 'pretty good when it comes to build quality', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'feels premium', 'positive'], ['Software', 'good so far no bugs', 'positive'], ['UI', 'smooth', 'positive'], ['battery backup', "doesn ' t last whole day", 'negative'], ['battery backup', '6 - 7 hours of screen on time on wifi', 'negative'], ['battery backup', '5 hours on mobile data', 'negative'], ['Battery performance', 'could have been better', 'negative'], ['camera', 'day time pics are damn good', 'positive'], ['camera', 'feels little over - saturated', 'negative'], ['camera', 'night mode pics are not that great', 'negative'], ['camera', 'feels over - exposed', 'negative']]

I am unable to use internet , i have to constantly refresh and restart my device for better network . I am getting missed calls alerts via sms although mobile network shows full strength . .

I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother . I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon . Believe me it fabulous product so far . The screen is apt and very clear . Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc . Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material . Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space . Phone is quite light weight and very smart . I chose blue color and believe me it looks classy . Only issue it does not come with earphones I respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but I recommend this to all buyers . In nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too .

The product is looking great , better than its photos available online . I have purchased this item because of its light weight ( 145gm ) sleek design and impact processor within budget . It has no fingerprint lock but the face recognize lock system is great even in the low light . Camera and display both are ok recommend for daily rough use . If you have some extra budget then I also recommend you to buy Redmi 5 or Redmi 7 . Redmi 6a is great for me because I use mobile 16hrs a day surfing google and its weight and design is absolutely perfect for me within low budget . However , almost every Android phone is ok for the fist 1 . 5 - 2years , afterthat you know what will happen to it .####[['Redmi 6a', 'looking great', 'positive'], ['Redmi 6a', 'light weight ( 145gm ', 'positive'], ['Redmi 6a', 'sleek design', 'positive'], ['processor', 'impact', 'positive'], ['Redmi 6a', 'within budget ', 'positive'], ['fingerprint lock', 'no', 'negative'], ['face recognize lock system', 'great even in the low light', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'ok recommend for daily rough use', 'positive'], ['display', 'ok recommend for daily rough use', 'positive'], ['Redmi 6a', 'weight and design is absolutely perfect for me within low budget', 'positive']]
Redmi 6A will be the best pick in the budget range . Other competitors can ' t give the features and quality which Redmi can give you at your hand and in a cheapest range . The best features of this phone is , its traditional looks and features . Battery life is also long lasting . So no doubt , you can go for it .

I gifted this phone to my Mom , and she is happy . Phone size and shape is good . Camera is okay , don ' t expect pictures same or like as DSLR . Face recognition is awesome .

Redmi 6a is good product . But 2gb ram is less for smooth functioning . Picture and sound quality is best but battery is average . It ' s only 6 - 7 hours battery life if you charge fully then . You get MIUI 10 in redmi 6a . In camera you got portrait mode for selfies . Rear camera quality is too good . But it ' s work on mediatek this is it ' s minus point . Screen 5 . 5 inches .

Its a great product by xiaomi . It ' s affordable and durable . I have been using this product since last 3 years or more and it is still working . The camera is not upto the mark because it gives a bit blured pics in more light but overall the phone has all the features . The only feature I miss is the fingerprint . But compared to the pricing , this phone has pretty much every essential things .####[['phone', 'has all the features', 'positive'], ['xiaomi', 'great product', 'positive'], ['camera', 'not upto the mark', 'negative'], ['camera', 'bit blured pics in more light', 'negative'], ['fingerprint', 'miss', 'negative'], ['phone', 'pretty much every essential things', 'positive']]
Redmi has not worked on their camera for low light , hence picture quality at night stays poor . But picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price , the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well . It lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once . But I usually can play games seamlessly . The sound outlet is at the back . That is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed , it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones . Sound is okay , not very loud . Just fine and doable . Battery life could have been better , but if you ' re not online all day or playing video games for hours , changing once a day is more than enough . Biggest problem I ' ve faced is that the hotspot of this phone doesn ' t always work on my laptop . My laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots . All over , it ' s a good looking phone with sufficient qualities for this price point .####[['front camera', 'has features like background blur', 'positive'], ['camera', 'picture in good light is great', 'positive'], ['camera', 'picture quality at night stays poor', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'beauty filter works well', 'positive'], ['sound outlet', 'really poor design', 'negative'], ['Sound', 'okay', 'neutral'], ['Sound', 'not very loud', 'neutral'], ['Sound', 'fine', 'neutral'], ['Sound', 'doable', 'neutral'], ['Battery life', 'could have been better', 'negative'], ['Battery life', 'changing once a day is more than enough', 'neutral'], ['phone', "hotspot of this phone doesn ' t always work", 'negative'], ['phone', 'good looking', 'positive'], ['phone', 'sufficient qualities for this price point', 'positive'], ['phone', 'lags a little when you have a lot of apps active', 'negative'], ['phone', 'worth appreciating for this price', 'positive']]
Love the phone . Everything on it works as expected . I ' ve been using this phone for about 1 weeks , and so far I ' m loving it . Here ' s me breakdown : The quality , fit and finish are amazing . No one believes this is low priced phone . Battery : exceptional battery life , the best in any smartphone I ' ve had so far . Build / design : one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I ' ve used , even compared to much more expensive models . Camera : not as good as my Honor 7C , but still takes good enough pictures that it ' s not really a problem for me .####[['phone', 'Everything on it works as expected', 'positive'], ['phone', 'low priced', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'exceptional', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'best in any smartphone', 'positive'], ['phone', 'best smartphone designs', 'positive'], ['phone', 'build quality', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'takes good enough pictures', 'neutral'], ['quality', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['fit', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['finish', 'amazing', 'positive']]
The phone feels good in hand and quite handy compared to 18 : 9 phones . The battery backup is really good and lasts easily a day with light to normal usage . Screen is good and maybe best for price segment . Speakers are adequately loud but not that loud . Easily handled 1 - 3 apps at a time . And the camera is awesome with portrait mode only in FRONT camera . I have attached a image with with HDR on and other zoomed part of same image for image quality and idea about it . Gaming isn ' t expected for this phone and I don ' t judge it on gaming basis . No lag issue people just fill the phone will lot of apps and complain about lag which seems stupid . Minor lags are possible as RAM is 2gb . You get Oreo out of box and with miui 9 . 6 and 8 - 9 gb ROM available and Miui 10 update is available which is quite better features wise but has minor lags compared to Miui 9 . 6 .####[['phone', 'feels good in hand', 'positive'], ['phone', 'quite handy', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'really good', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'lasts easily a day with light to normal usage', 'positive'], ['Screen', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'maybe best for price segment', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'adequately loud', 'positive'], ['Speakers', 'not that loud', 'neutral'], ['phone', 'Easily handled 1 - 3 apps at a time', 'positive'], ['camera', 'awesome', 'positive'], ['camera', 'portrait mode only in FRONT camera', 'negative'], ['phone', 'No lag issue', 'positive'], ['RAM', 'Minor lags are possible', 'neutral'], ['Miui 10', 'update is available', 'positive'], ['Oreo', 'out of box', 'positive']]
Let me start off by telling you what this phone is not good at . Gaming . Games like PUBG and similar intensive games will lag inevitably . But the best thing about this phone is that this is the only negative about this device . Day to day performance is fine , call quality is great , camera is doable , battery life is amazing and even the build quality is not bad . At this price point , this phone provides a very satisfactory and pleasing experience . Sure it ' s not as good as more expensive phones , but it ' s not supposed to be . It ' s supposed to be the phone for everyone , which can do everything an average user would expect . Must buy if you ' re looking to buy a smartphone at this price point .####[['phone', 'not good at .

Hello to everyone , I have bought this phone on 3rd December 2018 . I want a phone which is easy to hold , easy to use and also cheap in price . I also have a confusing if getting a brst mobile in cheap price , I have searched many times in the youtubr and the other sources then I git this mobile phone . I get impresses by its face lock features . My Father has redmi note 3 which has fingerprint lock system but the problem is that system do nit work if out hands are wet or any thing is puy on our hand . Facr lock is easy and best method to unlock any device easily . I have the problem with its speed . This mobile has also the great disadvantage of getting hanged many times and also need to improve its speed . Many softwares fo not work with it fully so we have to make yhis sure to choose the right software for this mobile phone .

After 1 year use : - Memory is less needed some more ( but it ' s quality is good ) Powerful - Camera , LED light , Sound Waste - Screen Light , heating while playing games for more than 40 minutes .

I bought this a gift to my mom who doesn ' t use mobile other than for watching videos . I liked the lowest price point offering but the volume is really low . we end up using headphones . it is so annoying to use that it almost made the phone unusable .

It ' s my bad that even though I read about this phone having issues like hanging etc I went for it just because as price factor as I would be using this as secondary phone . But complete dissatisfaction . Phone hangs even just with one app WhatsApp . Battery even though its 100 % comes down to less than 20 % in 4 - 5 hours ( Yes with out Data , GPS enabled ) . I tried returning this phone and its pathetic that Amazon straightly said they cant return I seriously felt very unhappy with their response on phone , calling agent started giving me gyaan about settings I said I already did more that what she said , so last final answer is I cant return the phone so waste of money . So now 6K under the drain Amazon doesn ' t care once its sold ( its not a offer sale ) . Thanks Amazon you surpassed Flipkart in cheating customers .

Fantastic product in terms of body , looks , battery etc . The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life . Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern ; especially more observed when dual space is enabled . Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads . Go for a Google search of " Phone Has been locked , Try Again in 119 minutes " and verify yourself . Its all about the bug in several of the mi product , and personally faced many times . Imagine you have to call a Uber or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message . Other issue is heating , which is prominent in hot weather . Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer . Otherwise phone is good in this budget .####[['body', 'Fantastic', 'positive'], ['looks', 'Fantastic', 'positive'], ['battery', 'Fantastic', 'positive'], ['software', 'buggy', 'negative'], ['software', 'security bug', 'negative'], ['software', 'locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern', 'negative'], ['Mi', 'bug in several of the mi product', 'negative'], ['phone', 'heating', 'negative'], ['phone', 'good in this budget', 'positive']]
This product is a very mediocre product . You can ' t even play 60 FPS videos in the youtube app . In short , if you want to do only phone and messaging with this app , you ' ll be fine . For everything else , this phone sucks . Picture quality of camera is decent , not very good . The screen quality sucks . Performance of the phone sucks too . Have 4 or more apps open and the phone will start stuttering heavily . All background apps will have to be force closed to get an optimal performance .####[['phone', 'very mediocre product', 'neutral'], ['Performance', 'sucks', 'negative'], ['screen', 'quality sucks', 'negative'], ['screen', "can ' t even play 60 FPS videos", 'negative'], ['phone', 'stuttering heavily', 'negative'], ['Performance', 'background apps will have to be force closed to get an optimal performance', 'negative'], ['camera', 'decent', 'neutral'], ['camera', 'not very good', 'negative']]
The phone is not up to the mark . . As I have seen all the rating and all . . . And i thought I will get a good deal but seriously this phone is waste of money . . .

Sound Quality is very poor as even on high volume the phone’s ringtone is very audible . The only reason why I bought this phone was due to MI’s reputation of good battery performance which failed to deliver as even after the phone usage is hardly for an hour , it requires charging the next day as well & for the battery to be fully charged , it takes too long .

I have been using Redmi 4A which I bouhght a year back in the similar kind of sale at same price which is far better in color contrast and other specification . Visual images showing in the promotions interms of sleek design and depth absolutely wrong as its depth looks normal . Especially for the 4A users , it looks quiet low graded model . Increased the length of the mobile but width seems to be not matching up . Font and icon names like Gallery , , etc doesn ' t look that clear to read properly . Totally compared with Redmi 4A , it is a big failure and I won ' t even suggest anyone to spend 6000 rs for this mobile . I took lot of time to consider chinese phone , but they proved once agian that their products are worst . One biggest disadvantage is half of the memory of 16 GB will be used for internal apps of MI .####[['Redmi 4A', 'depth looks normal ', 'neutral'], ['Redmi 4A', 'looks quiet low graded model', 'negative'], ['Redmi 4A', 'big failure', 'negative'], ['Redmi 4A', 'worst', 'negative'], ['memory', 'biggest disadvantage is half', 'negative'], ['memory', '16 GB will be used for internal apps', 'negative']]
Worst phone . Hangs a lot . Very slow and sluggish compared to realme c1 and redmi 5a or even redmi 2 prime ! Photo quality also worst front facing camera . Processor is very far behind in real life usage compared to snapdragon 450 in realme c1 . Can ' t play pubg even in low quality as it hangs . Display is also not so large compared to realme c1 . Please by honor or realme c1 or asus zenfone max pro m1 instead of this . They said after I purchased that I cannot return product for phones . So got my money wasted so please don ' t purchase . Display is also poor when watching video at start then recovers slowly . In general not a worthy phone at all by Xiaomi !

Camera is very poor 13mp camera quality shows but when we take pictures quality is 5mp camera like that . When phone is released mi6a 9000rs at the time phone quality is OK . But 5500rs same mi6a phone quality is very poor . When phone rate is high phone quality is a good . And phone rate is low phone quality also poor . My suggestion is when phone comes to market phone price is high please buy that time only . Not a price drop time .####[['Camera', 'very poor', 'negative'], ['camera quality', 'take pictures quality is 5mp', 'negative'], ['mi6a', 'quality is very poor', 'negative']]
It has an absolutely stunning design with BMW Racing Lines . I loved the look of it . In Call of Duty , 8 Gen 2 Processor makes sure there is zero lag and super smooth game I can play . Movies and Videos seem really realistic in this as the brightness of display is so high and best part it even with all this my Battery would easily last more than 1 . 5 Days without Charging .

For sure that this device is ' value for money ' . But the specs are not of any use , it has extra ram as compared to other devices in the same range , but its of no use as graphics , screen refresh rate are not compatible , hence he ram is just kind of waste here . Camera quality is also poor , yes it ' s not upto the mark . You can avail this phone for normal use , but camera needs to be better .

I bought this mobile on 7th september and it got bad the next day after delivery the problem was automatic restart . Restarting automatically four to five times a day , After a lot of hard work and thrice the Amazon technician came , it got replaced but the problem is still the same , now it restarts only twice . I wanted to give it a star but it has so many features which you will not get in any other mobile and the camera is just below average , I will not recommend this mobile to anyone , so buy it at your own risk .

Camera is the main highlight of this phone . Practically primary and telephoto camera is very good , ultra wide not so . . SD 8 GEN 2 does its job to run the phone in 2k 120hz mode smoothly without any frame drops in the UI , opening and closing multiple apps , playing games etc . My only complaint will be MIUI though its very refined version still the updates are not that fast ( India Rom ) . Also promised to get 3Yrs of Android + 5Yrs of security updates . In my opinion it should be in line with the Oneplus or Samsung flagships ( 4 + 5 ) . Other than that its a proper flagship experience .

I bought it mainly for the camera and it doesn ' t disappoint there but there are things which not good and which my 5 years old op6 did better , way better infact . The signal catching power is way too low be it wifi or sim ( Airtel and Jio ) . Screen doesn ' t feel as good as my Nexus 3 felt . There ' s lots of small time glitches which I don ' t know if software updates will correct . Bought it for wireless charging but 50w compatible wireless is still not launched in India .

I bought this phone on 22nd may ' 22 . Here I like to share that there is no gallery and regular music apps in this phone . Pics we get from Google photos only . We need to download those apps . And I have given 3 star for picture bcz automatically it ' s taking dim pics though sun light exists and we take it from shadow . For a while brightness occurs but not every time . rest all good . we can excuse these minor things as Google photos also have every feature and can download music app and can go ahead for this phone .

I bought it for 24 . 5k . I was using Poco F1 from past 5 years and it was great , when compared to this smartphone .  Realme UI3 process is not that great . There is no much features or play around in the settings .  Camera detailing is not great at this price point . Don ' t feel like sony camera is used here . Front camera is worst . 50MP camera is for back n not self and the is just of the phone .  Phone gets heated little .  Processer is great but Ram management is not that great .####[['Realme UI3', 'not that great', 'negative'], ['Realme UI3', 'no much features', 'negative'], ['Realme UI3', 'play around in the settings', 'negative'], ['Camera', 'detailing is not great', 'negative'], ['Front camera', 'worst', 'negative'], ['Processer', 'great', 'positive'], ['Ram management', 'not that great', 'negative'], ['Phone', 'gets heated little', 'neutral']]

Battery performance is very poor , very worst battery backup I have ever seen . I am a normal user , even after that it ' s charging twice in a day . But the charging speed is very good . The front camera is also not good at this price point , it ' s below average . Back camera performance is good .####[['battery backup', 'very worst', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'performance is very poor', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'charging twice in a day', 'negative'], ['Battery', 'charging speed is very good', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'not good at this price point', 'negative'], ['front camera', 'below average', 'negative'], ['Back camera', 'performance is good', 'positive']]
If we talk about performance then it is good , no lagging but front camera and wide angle camera is really worst . It should be at least 32 MP front and 50MP wide angle . They have not provided headphone jack . This phone is good for performance and gaming . If u want to buy over all camera and performance then go for gt 2 pro .####[['performance', 'good', 'positive'], ['performance', 'no lagging', 'positive'], ['front camera', 'worst', 'negative'], ['wide angle camera', 'worst', 'negative'], ['headphone jack', 'not provided', 'negative'], ['gaming', 'good', 'positive']]
I have been using this for 2 days . I liked the camera and display so much . Realme ui is so nice . Charging speed is good . Battery backup is good as well .    I have not faced any heating issue until now and have very smooth experience thanks to snapdragon 888 .    Only con I have seen is the ram management but for average user it is not a problem .    I would say overall balanced phone with customization ui with great camera . I am loving it .####[['Realme ui', 'nice', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'backup is good', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'Charging speed is good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'not faced any heating issue', 'positive'], ['snapdragon 888', 'very smooth experience', 'positive'], ['ram management', 'Only con', 'negative'], ['phone', 'overall balanced', 'positive'], ['camera', 'great', 'positive'], ['phone', 'customization ui', 'positive']]
Phone is awesome I bought the phone in 27k with this smartphone comes with the Snapdragon 888 which is very powerful and the device is fully optimised  Battery backup is good nearly 8 hours screen on time with normal usage . Camera with OIS is a big advantage in this price range . If your budget is 30 k go for it without any hesitation . The other phone in this price range is iQOO 9 SE but the phone comes with the funtouch OS which makes that phone very bad####[['Phone', 'awesome', 'positive'], ['Snapdragon 888', 'very powerful', 'positive'], ['Snapdragon 888', 'fully optimised', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'good nearly 8 hours screen on time with normal usage', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'OIS is a big advantage', 'positive'], ['Phone', 'budget is 30 k go for it without any hesitation', 'neutral']]
It contains the beast SD 888 which allows you to perform tremendously through long period usage . The Sony IMX766 sensor clarifies the pics and videos to the utmost . This phone also has a feature of recording in 4k 60 fps , thus you won ' t face any troubles while shooting vlogs . The speed of charging is pretty much sufficient , though battery backup could be better .  The best color amongst these three is the paper green which looks even more fascinating with the designer ' s signature .####[['SD 888', 'beast', 'positive'], ['SD 888', 'perform tremendously through long period usage', 'positive'], ['battery', 'speed of charging is pretty much sufficient', 'positive'], ['battery', 'backup could be better', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'feature of recording in 4k 60 fps', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'Sony IMX766 sensor', 'positive']]
Value for money Wala Flagship , I really liked its Camera performance . . . . 50MP primary sensor is killer . . . . Night mode & starry mode also too good . . . .  But only disadvantage in this Flagship killer , that is it ' s battery backup not up to the mark . . but no too much battery drained . . . it ' s batterybackup is 7 - 8 hours Screen on time . . Realme please optimised this issue ASAP . I feel heating issue on it . . . . Basically SDM888 heating issue is normal . . . . but it ' s cooling technology is good !

Changing my review after couple of months , camera and battery is good . But display is hdr10 + but still no update for 4k in Netflix and other ott app , this can be done by update . Also average brightness is very low but it go upto 1300 nits Realme is doing good but in terms of update or quick solutions it ' s very weak Performance is good but not much as we expect from sd 888 . this also can be updated by ui update .####[['camera', 'good', 'positive'], ['battery', 'good', 'positive'], ['display', 'hdr10 + but still no update for 4k', 'neutral'], ['display', 'average brightness is very low', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'very weak Performance', 'negative'], ['sd 888', 'good but not much', 'neutral']]
Overall the device is Good but the price should be somewhere around 25k but not 30k . Battery backup is 9 hours for average usage which should be atleast 12 hours for average usage . Display is fabulous , camera is above OK , Performance is 4 star .####[['Battery backup', '9 hours for average usage', 'negative'], ['Display', 'fabulous', 'positive'], ['camera', 'above OK', 'positive'], ['device', 'Good', 'positive'], ['device', 'price should be somewhere around 25k but not 30k', 'negative'], ['device', 'Performance is 4 star', 'positive']]
I think this is one of the best phone in market at this price range . . . . . decent camera , great charging speed , resilient and premium look , flagship processor . I don ' t like glass finish body so this paperback body is super good for me . Realme has come a long way and step up into premium segment . I don ' t think next flagship phones from realme come at this discounted price .####[['phone', 'best', 'positive'], ['camera', 'decent', 'positive'], ['processor', 'flagship', 'positive'], ['phone', 'premium look', 'positive'], ['phone', 'resilient', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'great charging speed', 'positive']]
I Have been using this phone from 15 days . Dint find any issue yet . I seen many comments regarding heating issue specially while charging but I never faced that problems , phone performance is really good and can handle multi - tasking effectively . Ram management is also good . The only con is camera is not very impressive in this price range and could have been better .####[['phone', 'performance is really good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'never faced that problems', 'positive'], ['Ram management', 'good', 'positive'], ['camera', 'not very impressive in this price range', 'negative'], ['phone', 'can handle multi - tasking effectively', 'positive']]
