display is as beautiful as it is risky . As curved display are prone to break and this one doesn ' t have any gorilla glass protection . And curved tempered cost 5 times more than regular tempered glass . This model curved tempered cost me around 450 while flat tempered cost around 50 .

I got v25pro on 27sept . Mobile looks and display is great but not good with camera quality specially at night shots . May be taking some nice pics during day but can not say great .

This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get . Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms . Moreover , performance wise it is a benchmark . You will not be disappointed in this budget .

Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone .    Best features with stunning looks & performance .    Battery life is very good .

Totally worth the price if :    - you are a iOS fan  - like compact phone  - want to switch from android to iPhone  - you like clicking some good photos ( camera is unbeatable )  - you multitask ( normal phones get stuck between apps , this will keep you going without a hiatus ( lag )  - you like to listen to music ( have 2 speakers , one on the front , and another below ; when I watch a movie with 4d - 5d music , it feels like Dolby atmos )    There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into ( you can visit youtube for technical features ) .####[['phone', 'Totally worth the price', 'positive'], ['camera', 'unbeatable', 'positive'], ['phone', 'going without a hiatus ( lag ', 'positive'], ['phone', 'There a lot a technical advantages', 'positive']]

Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it .

Coming to battery , I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage , it easily lasts 24 hours .

Let ' s face it . The main reason you ' re even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn ' t compromise on power . Getting OS updates for another 4 - 5 years , with a decent camera , waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage .    There ' s a few things it could ' ve done better :    1 . Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage .  2 . The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio .  3 . Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement .  4 .

This is an amazing phone for the price . For someone coming from a pure Android background , migrating data would take a little time , and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1 - 2 days . Once it is all set , I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup . The backup with the 1800 mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity .  Camera is amazing for my use , as the lighting and colour tone are Natural , close to what we would see with our bare eyes . I did not see any grains kicking in during low light conditions .####[['phone', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['battery backup', 'quite less for the first 1 - 2 days', 'negative'], ['battery backup', 'decent', 'neutral'], ['Camera', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'lighting and colour tone are Natural', 'positive']]
This is my first iPhone . And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable . The camera is better in every way . The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame / sec super slow motion recording . Performance is way too better than android . This is fast , very very fast . If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok . In fact this is the only issue with this phone . This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most .

The performance iss as expected great , the battery life is not actually a concern , but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww . Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager , with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20 % left and you could get near to 80 , . Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming , 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season .  Camera is good enough for the price don ' t expect flagship level performance , as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me .  Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros ,  Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features ,  And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .

I jumped from old SE to the new SE . the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm .  The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design . Looks so good in white colour .  Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU .  If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it . But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed , CAMERA , looks , iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device .  Battery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don’t play games this device is giving me 5 - 6 hrs of usage time ( you tube , camera , music , browsing , etc etc )  M using white colour with product red apple leather case . This is the perfect contrast with white colour .

This is my first iPhone . I would say that coming from Android , there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it .    Coming to the phone itself , camera is amazing minus the low light photography part . Battery backup is ok ok . I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low . Also since I am mostly at home , it doesn’t matter so much . Display is ok . Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse . But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand .    Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run . It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game , battery will tale a hit .####[['camera', 'amazing minus the low light', 'positive'], ['Battery backup', 'ok ok', 'neutral'], ['battery', 'low', 'negative'], ['Display', 'ok', 'positive'], ['Display', 'small one', 'negative'], ['Display', 'huge bezels ofcourse', 'negative'], ['Display', 'you can reach the entire screen with one hand', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'great value for money', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'very capable', 'positive'], ['iPhone', 'any heavy game , battery will tale a hit', 'negative']]
One of the best handsets , very easy to carry & handle . Exceptional performance & amazing display , however battery is the only concern . It consumes more battery when you use internet , especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures . Otherwise everything thing is perfect . People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this . But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger .####[['display', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['battery', 'only concern', 'negative'], ['battery', 'consumes more battery when you use internet', 'negative'], ['handsets', 'everything thing is perfect', 'positive'], ['battery', 'carry a fast charger', 'negative'], ['handsets', 'best', 'positive'], ['handsets', 'very easy to carry & handle', 'positive'], ['handsets', 'Exceptional performance', 'positive']]

It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it , the camera is a beast , the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use , if ur a heavy user you ' d need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get really good game play , worth the money , between if ur coming for a larger screen , you might feel it ' s a lil too small but honestly it ' s not really that small , so buy it , it ' s perfect .####[['camera', 'beast', 'positive'], ['battery', 'just fine through out the day with mild use', 'neutral'], ['battery', "heavy user you ' d need to charge", 'neutral'], ['NULL', 'performance is epic', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'so beautiful', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'really good game play', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'worth the money', 'positive'], ['screen', 'not really that small', 'neutral']]
It’s a beast in performance , only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography . Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it , not meant for heavy users . It can handle each and every task very easily . Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it , whether a heavy gameplay or exporting / rendering of heavy videos . Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand . I’ve been using it for more than 9 months . It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above .

I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary . The user interface and the camera is too good . Just in love with this extraordinary device .

It ' s a new iPhone ! It ' s faster than the last ones I guess , and it should be good for the next 80k miles . The only gripes I might have , probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS . I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer , and it seems my screen isn ' t nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR . As I ' ve said though , it ' s most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out . Still a nice piece of kit , yet no real surprises either .

Awesome product must buy . Well , switching from Android to iOS will make you a little uncomfortable as Siri can ' t understand Hindi . The most important I like about this phone is that Bgmi get opens within 11 to 13 seconds . Speaker is awesome , the display is fantastic , battery is 3200 . And most important speed and camera are incredible . Check my photos . If you want to switch then don ' t buy iPhone 11 or 12 must go for 13 or 14 . Well , I am leaving this review after using it for 1 week . I ordered it on 27 August and I received it on 8 October . Today is 13 October . Thanks , Flipkart for another awesome product . You have always resolved my issues and I have done 3 - 4 lac shopping from this platform till now still waiting for my next want .

I have been using this iphone for more than an month and i must say it is worth the money . It has a good battery as compared to other iphone versions , but obviously not as good as android .

The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s . The battery life is longer . And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro ( even on a non - Pro phone ) .  Yes , the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land . But it’s more about what this chip lets you do . This includes Cinematic mode , which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus , and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics .####[['display', 'brighter', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'longer', 'positive'], ['camera', 'great', 'positive'], ['camera', 'new sensors', 'positive'], ['camera', 'computational photography features', 'positive'], ['A15 Bionic', 'fastest chip in the land', 'positive'], ['Cinematic mode', 'adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus', 'positive'], ['camera', 'Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics', 'positive']]
Switched from android to iOS .  In hand feel of iPhone 13 is very good . . superb to be precise because of its 6 . 1 inch display .  Battery performance is simply awesome .

I became first user of I phone . Let ' s start with the design . One of many things that  a lot of people , including me , love about Apple ' s  iPhones is the familiarity that they bring to the  table year - on - year while being ingenious enough to  make subtle changes in the design . Heavy HDR camera performance .####[['camera performance', 'Heavy HDR', 'positive'], ["Apple ' s", 'enough to  make subtle changes in the design', 'positive']]
Worth for the money for those who like to enjoy a normal 6 inch mobile device . Awesome experience of having a new iPhone 13 in hand .  The picture clarity is good . Battery is 5 / 5 for me when compared other apple models .

Excellent product . I always had a question why would someone want to invest 50k + on a mobile phone but now my views have changed .  Photos are just amazing its really hard to imagine how good the photos are even in the low light conditions  With A15 chip inside you - can throw any task at it and it will perform without any lag be games or your office work just so easy to work around and switch between multiple apps without getting them close .

Most valuable product . Got this for 66k and its worth enough to spend on premium products . The UI looks super clean and the body got metal on the sides and glass finish on the back .

Writing review after using 2 weeks its good phone , Camera was superb then any android phones , I am android users but after using iOS software I loved it , it was smooth and no lag at all after playing heavy games with high settings , A15 bionic chipset was really fast and battery efficient its last almost one day with heavy usage , Overall phone was very good in every perspective , thanks to the Flipkart for fastest delivery !####[['Camera', 'superb', 'positive'], ['iOS', 'smooth', 'positive'], ['iOS', 'no lag at all after playing heavy games with high settings', 'positive'], ['A15 bionic chipset', 'really fast', 'positive'], ['battery', 'efficient its last almost one day with heavy usage', 'positive'], ['phone', 'good', 'positive'], ['phone', 'very good', 'positive'], ['Flipkart', 'fastest delivery', 'positive']]
Apple as always surprises with the fluidity of the UI and the esthetics design , I ' m upgrading from XS to 13 and I ' m not regretting a bit , I mean dont get me wrong XS is a stunning phone after 3 odd years of time with it , never felt sluggish but iPhone 13 is a big jump and a game changer love the design , love the UI and the haptics of course very clean look and feel . I got this phone for 52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days , Thanks to flipkart the delivey was even more faster as expected . I will definitely come back after 3 months of usage with the review . donno about the battery life but definitely better than the XS .####[['iPhone 13', 'esthetics design', 'positive'], ['iPhone 13', 'a game changer', 'positive'], ['haptics', 'very clean look and feel', 'positive'], ['UI', 'love', 'positive'], ['iPhone 13', 'love the design', 'positive'], ['flipkart', '52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days', 'positive'], ['flipkart', 'delivey was even more faster as expected', 'positive']]
Just okay , nothing great really . More hype , less substance . Camera is downright disappointing . It’s great on the pro models , but not on this one . Low - light photography is good , but daylight photography is a disaster . Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom . My four - year old Samsung S9 plus produced far superior quality images than this . So I’m really disappointed with the cameras on this phone and repent having payed a fortune for the same . Avoid buying this phone if you are looking for good quality cameras , go for Samsung’s flagship S - series phones instead . This one is more of a show - off .####[['Camera', 'downright disappointing', 'positive'], ['cameras', 'really disappointed', 'negative'], ['cameras', 'Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom', 'negative'], ['cameras', 'Low - light photography is good', 'positive'], ['cameras', 'daylight photography is a disaster', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Avoid buying', 'negative'], ['phone', 'More hype , less substance', 'negative'], ['phone', 'nothing great really', 'negative'], ['phone', 'more of a show - off', 'negative'], ['phone', 'Just okay', 'neutral']]
Good phone Please Use Iphone 13 In Low Power Mode for Good Battery performance , Also Good Display 1 problem with display 60Hz refresh rate but iOS adjust this and give me best display performance smoother than Android Phone with 60Hz , My brother banged it against the wall but nothing happened except a crack on Display So Durability is Good Over All price this phone price little bit costly but phone is good , Ill give some camera samples in photos####[['Iphone 13', 'Good', 'positive'], ['Battery performance', 'Low Power Mode for Good', 'positive'], ['Display', 'Good', 'positive'], ['Display', 'best display performance', 'positive'], ['Iphone 13', 'Durability is Good', 'positive'], ['Iphone 13', 'price little bit costly', 'negative'], ['Iphone 13', 'good', 'positive']]
1st time using an iPhone . Didn’t expect to blend in so easily . Though it is different from android , however the system is still easy to use and super responsive .

It’s a perfect one . Build quality , camera ( don’t need to say anything on it ) , iOS , everything is good . You don’t need an upgrade for next 4 to 5 years .

It ' s beautiful and apple . but when i look back at my S22 Plus , this feels like a mediocre device from apple . i am not saying it ' s bad , but android is way ahead in terms of performance , battery , camera ( yess , samsung camera is amazing ) and connectivity .  It took me 30 minutes to connect and organize this iPhone to my car but android auto worked like magic and connects in less than 3 seconds . It ' s funny but this is real world data i am talking about . Then there are ads , i have system wide ad block installed on android and on iPhone u can ' t do that . Battery control is alot better on android again due to various software tweaks and it makes ur phone live for 2 days while iPhone is just barely 1 day . Okay enough of it . IPhone is best if you are iPhone fan . And let ' s leave android for productivity people .####[['iPhone', '30 minutes to connect and organize', 'negative'], ['iPhone', 'beautiful', 'positive'], ['Battery', 'just barely 1 day', 'positive']]
After a very long time I switched back to the iPhone . Because I was using android devices since very long time , now I find it bit difficult work with it fluently . But , because iphone has the best online security , I again switched back to the Apple iPhone to use my official number in it , so I can keep my official data more secure and safe . Though , I am still using android phone as my secondary phone , because android is best for the entertainment purpose .####[['iphone', 'best online security', 'positive']]

The iPhone 13 is a fantastic device . The camera system is top - notch , producing beautiful and detailed photos and videos . The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning - fast performance , making multitasking and gaming a breeze . The 5G capability is also a great addition , allowing for faster internet speeds and improved connectivity . The Ceramic Shield front cover provides better durability and drop protection .

The migration from android to IOS is so painful .  First the phone : A solid one , boxy and feels good in hand . Excellent display , camera is good , battery …amazing . For some reason I see that my mobile signal is weak , this was not the case with my android phone .  Second the IOS : I didn’t find it amusing . From a customisation perspective it is probable 5 years behind android . There are certain simple things are missing , it’s a long list . But from a RAM and battery management , it is outstanding . From an user experience perspective , I am really struggling .    Best part is , I got it in sale for a good price after trading in my old phone .####[['phone', 'feels good in hand', 'positive'], ['display', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['camera', 'good', 'positive'], ['battery', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['phone', 'signal is weak', 'negative'], ['IOS', 'didn’t find it amusing', 'negative'], ['RAM', 'outstanding', 'positive'], ['battery', 'outstanding', 'positive'], ['phone', 'good price', 'positive']]

I ' ve never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max . I finally pulled the trigger and got it .    Now coming to the phone , it ' s nothing short of amazing . It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it . If you ' re sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart , don ' t be . It ' s a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neat    The only downside I see to this phone is the storage . I got the 128 GB model and feel that it is waaay to low if you use the cameras regularly .    Overall very satisfied with the purchase .####[['storage', 'downside', 'negative'], ['cameras', 'feel that it is waaay to low', 'negative'], ['13 Pro Max', 'very satisfied with the purchase', 'positive']]
Fantastic product even though it ' s just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro . The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it ' s beautiful . Dynamic island is very practical and useful . Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it .    Flipkart ' s delivery was quick and hassle free .

Earlier I had plan to go with S23 + but buying a iphone is a personal preference , i have gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I / we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android . I would rate s23 + 10 / 10 and even iphone 14 pro 10 / 10 as the only difference i could see is the os .####[['iphone', 'better', 'positive'], ['iphone', 'smother and faster performance', 'positive']]
It ' s my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation I love the color , I love the accessibility of the phone . . . .

iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display . The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment .  If you can survive with an HD + LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you .

Amazing camera quality as expected , battery also has very good performance . Display , body , and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had . Sound quality of speakers is more than sufficient . Apple is known for it’s customer friendly security services and I can see it how . The A13 processor is the best in its work . So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it , just go for it without delay .    The most amazing thing it the delivery . Flipkart has delivered it in the span of 17hrs .

Best in class . Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD . But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands . Portrait mode is best to click pictures .

I have received this product on 18th March , thanks to Flipkart that he product was received very fast . This is the genuine review of the phone which I have felt on my side . The product is overall good enough . The camera I feel little bad , in the day light its ok . . and even in the night we can take the photos but when the light is not good enough the photos are not good . The battery wise is ok i am changing 2 times in a day ( not fully dropped ) . I am using the phone by data connection full time on . The video quality is not upto the mark . I think they will look into that in future updates . Performance wise and display wise no words to say its excellent . So please look into the camera performance and the battery side this is the only request from my side .

I ' ve had a fantastic experience with Motog73 so far . I could not imagine these many features in a phone ( particularly in this price range ) , and the camera really steals the show with its 2micron 50MP imaging system . This phone produces visually captivating , lively , colorful , and stunning images straight out of the box so I won ' t have to spend time making a lot of changes . The night light also captures incredible pictures without any blurring areas . When it comes to taking pictures , it comfortably beats my friend ' s oneplus phone which is famous for its camera . The colors are very vibrant and eye - catching . and the display is legible even in bright sunlight . Playing games and watching movies is another enjoyable experience on g73 . In terms of daily performance also , the phone is quick and smooth .

The phone is excellent , very smooth and easy to run . Camera has massively improved as per Motorola standards but the .

I played music , the sound is crisp and very pleasant . Phone calls are good . 5G works very well . There is a very good option to protect 5g from draining your data , phone puts you on 4g .

Not a good product . I bought it as it was advertised for 2 micrometer camera which just turned out to be a hype . Camera is just average .    This phone does not support 5g at the moment .

Product is awesome in this price range .

At first thanks to Flipkart for delivery in 1day.  Performance of this phone is very good and smooth. I feel it's really 120z. No Network issues in my Village always show 4G+ signal.

You only use system wallpaper and theme.  There is no available gallery, file management, Music player apps like other brand phones. All apps are working with Google products.  Video quality is good HDR supported.####[]
ve been using the Moto G73 5G for a while now, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its performance. The phone has a large 6.5-inch screen with a high refresh rate that makes scrolling through apps and websites smooth and seamless. The 5G connectivity is also a big plus, as I can easily stream videos, make video calls, and download large files without any lag.  The phone's battery life is impressive, lasting me through a full day of moderate to heavy usage. I also appreciate the phone's fast charging capabilities, which allow me to top up the battery quickly when needed.####[]

The review I am writing after 10 days of usage . The initial impression is really good . The display is crystal clear and is soft on eyes . Functioning of phone is very smooth .  I am yet to explore the phone fully but the basic usage has satisfied me a lot and some very useful features of phone , like karate chop switching on of torch light , twist and open the camera are very handy . 10 days of use is quite less to write an extensive review but it gives an idea of the quality of product to an extent .  Overall seems to me a good buy and value for money . I prefer separate slot for SDCard and as this phone has a hybrid slot for sim cards and SDCard so I have to adjust with this shortcoming for my preference .####[['phone', 'initial impression is really good', 'positive'], ['display', 'crystal clear', 'positive'], ['display', 'soft on eyes', 'positive'], ['phone', 'Functioning of phone is very smooth', 'positive'], ['phone', 'very useful features', 'positive'], ['camera', 'very handy', 'positive'], ['phone', 'good buy', 'positive'], ['phone', 'value for money', 'positive']]

Really surprised me . . 8 to 100 % charge within 1 hour only and battery backup is so awesome . 2 days life . Camera is also best in the class . Played COD and Asphalt 9 for more than 3 hours no heating or battery fast draining problem . Most important feature is Dolby Atmos working perfectly . If you are a music lover best choice for you . connect the Dolby Atmos supported earbuds and it will surprise you with a great music experience . Really a value for money product . Heavily recommended if you have a budget of 18k .####[['battery', 'charge within 1 hour', 'neutral'], ['battery backup', 'awesome', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'best in the class', 'positive'], ['product', 'no heating', 'positive'], ['battery', 'fast draining problem', 'negative'], ['Dolby Atmos', 'working perfectly', 'positive'], ['Dolby Atmos', 'great music experience', 'positive'], ['product', 'value for money', 'positive'], ['product', 'Heavily recommended', 'positive']]
Besides camera everything is good .  If you are camera person and don ' t have any use then don ' t buy .  I ' f you want great game experience , display quality and performance then must buy .

i have always been using multiple brands of mobiles so i would say this is one of the best mobile under 19K I really like the design and practicality elements like side mounted finger print scanner , dual speaker , moto family space , premium back case etc Camera is pretty good but only if you know how to use it properly .####[['mobile', 'best', 'positive'], ['Camera', 'pretty good', 'positive']]
I regret it so so much . This doesn ' t even have a decent camera . The selfie camera has a bluish tint . the battery last for about 6 - 7 hour for an avg user .

In box case not fitted with the phone,I am a little worried that the phone is original or the cover , When charging sometimes the percentage goes up from what it was and sometimes it goes down just wondering if I got the right phone.####[]
I ordered Moto G73 on 16th March which was delivered to me on 18th March . I would like to share that its battery life is really pathetic . Even if the phone is not in use , the battery drains very fast . It has happened a couple of times now that the battery was at around 55 % at 11 pm ( when I put the phone on DND ) . When I checked the phone the next day at 7 am , the phone was off ! The battery drains very fast even at DND mode .####[['battery life', 'really pathetic', 'negative'], ['battery', 'drains very fast', 'negative']]

I recently purchased this device ( Motorola g73 5G ) , and I ' m extremely disappointed with its performance . Despite being in areas with strong network signals , the device is not sensing the network and is unable to connect to the internet or make calls . This is a major inconvenience and makes the device practically useless . I would not recommend this product to anyone who needs reliable network connectivity on their mobile device . 5G is not supporting .

Moto disappointed with this device , battery drains like anything , this is the core requirement for me but what I can do .  I have seen many reviews regarding battery issues , but didn ' t consider , TRUSTED THE BRAND .

Worst product in the market . Most of the time I ' m not able to use internet and hotspot is totally waste in OnePlus Nord 2T .

If your budget is 7000 then believe me this is the best choice , I ' m writing this review after one month use . over all performance is good . No lag during free fire at smooth graphics , No fingerprint sensor but its okey bcoz they already provided many features . 5000 mAh battery is amazing . it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use . and one day at highest use . I played free fire for 30 min and Amazing thing that battery used is only 5 % . this a the real value for money phone , full paisa wasul phone . also supports VoLTE calling and WiFi . big screen .####[['NULL', 'over all performance is good', 'positive'], ['screen', 'No fingerprint sensor', 'negative'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['5000 mAh battery', "it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use", 'positive'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'one day at highest use', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'supports VoLTE calling and WiFi', 'positive'], ['screen', 'big', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'No lag', 'positive'], ['screen', 'smooth graphics', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'real value for money', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'best choice', 'positive']]
Haven ' t got any complaints overall , good built quality , display is vibrant enough and bright , battery life is on the better side , lasts a while . It can feel a bit slow and take some time to load apps up but that ' s to be expected with a 2 GB RAM The camera could ' ve been better , it takes great vibrant photos but bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details . Not very fond of the audio unit , music sounds way harsh without any bass or the finer sounds .####[['NULL', 'good built quality', 'positive'], ['display', 'vibrant enough', 'positive'], ['display', 'bright', 'positive'], ['battery', 'life is on the better side', 'positive'], ['battery', 'lasts a while', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'It can feel a bit slow', 'negative'], ['2 GB RAM', 'take some time to load apps up', 'negative'], ['2 GB RAM', "but that ' s to be expected", 'neutral'], ['camera', "could ' ve been better", 'negative'], ['camera', 'it takes great vibrant photos', 'positive'], ['camera', 'bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'Not very fond of the audio unit ', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'music sounds way harsh without any bass', 'negative']]

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given . So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media .####[['camera', 'trash', 'negative'], ['battery', 'no fast charging', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'normal charger is given', 'negative'], ['smart phone', 'very good option', 'positive'], ['ram', '2 gb', 'neutral'], ['smart phone', "won ' t run very smooth", 'negative'], ['fingerprint sensor', 'no', 'negative'], ['battery', 'high battery life', 'positive']]
Bought it for ₹6799 . Still working proper after 2 years . Battery life on normal usage is about 1 - 1½ days , if used only for making calls then about 5 - 6 days .

I bought this phone for my mom . She ' s been using this phone since an year . I always buy redmi because they ' ve gained my trust . My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime . They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust , but shockingly , the phone was utter disappointment . My mom is a very light user . She only uses phone for calling and youtube . But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks . It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera . I resetted the phone , updated software , everything but of no use . Never expected this from a trustful brand like redmi . I suggest you guys to take little more priced phones from redmi , entry level phones are poor in performance .
