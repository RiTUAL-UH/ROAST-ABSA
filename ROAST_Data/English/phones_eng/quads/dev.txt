Battery drains too fast on the running of location services and the battery last around 8 to 9 hours while using location services continuously . The PPI should have to more as compared to previous smartphone . The brightness is very low as mentioned by the realme .

If you are confused between iqoo 9se and realme GT2 . I can say that just buy realme , it is full of features , customization and it ' s look is super . I must say if you want a balanced phone in every term , you should look to this phone .  BUT BUT BUT  There is a major problem which is Direct video call from google dailer . When I tried to do video call then it only shows black screen on both mobiles so buy it if you are a gamer not for official use .

Fantastic mobile in all means . This is the best Android in market without doubt and I feel this is far better than latest iPhone in terms of quality and features .  Noted my observations after 2 weeks of usage .    But think twice before buying this from Flipkart . Such a pathetic service . I bought this phone in exchange of my S20 Fe 5g . My mobile was in flawless condition and the exchange amount was 22k . But during inspection they told it has a scratch on side and 3k will be deducted . It was just a very minor line on the side and because of that they deducted 3000Rs . Absolutely ridiculous .

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE . It is quiet heavy and screen is rough hence the user ' s finger doesn ' t slide smoothly .  The software is very very poor . It doesn ' t have basic facilities like scheduled power on / off . The camera focusing and software is poor .  The phone doesn ' t allow user to do even basic settings like adjusting touch sensitivity . The user has to try multiple times to slide down the notification panel . These drawbacks are not due to any physical defects but due to very poor software and hardware design . The user can do only a few settings compared to other phones .

I ' ve been using it for a week now . And it did heat a lot in first 2days of use . But now this doesn ' t happen anymore .

At first hands - on , looks like a pretty solid phone considering the form factor . The obvious tradeoff is the battery life , I ' m getting around 3 . 5 - 3 . 8 hrs SOT on average with wifi always on and no sim card .

Honest review after 6 months . This is not a very good phone . This phone is very slow and number of apps hanged in this app . It is just a wastage of money . V20 is far better than this phone . Really disappointed with VIvo this time .

100 % real review . I ' m 2nd time Vivo user 1st phone was vivoz1x , very satisfied and now using v25 pro . In this phone major heating issue occurred when using camera . If using for 1 hour or more lagging start . Speed 6 / 10 Camera 9 / 10 but not upto the mark as Vivo claims . Macro lens is useless . Battery 10 / 10 Charging time 40min approx . Screen 9 / 10 . After using 1hour or more display start lagging also . Although In hand feel very premium . Really disappointed with Vivo this time . Guys this phone is not recommended for heavy use .

after 3 months of usage .  Better wait for Realme 10 pro + which will be at 20 to 25 segment    Apart from display phone is average . . . . . for curved display this is the only phone with value under this range .  Some software bugs are there with banking apps .  Speaker is obsolete rubbish . . . . no Dolby , single mono speaker which is of average quality .  For 1st 10 days as I noticed battery is draining fast .  Sim signals are perfect , as previously used oppo Reno 6 5G I only get 2 or 3 points at home but for this I get complete signal almost every time .  Haptic motar is rubbish , even I never saw this worst haptic feedback in 15K segment , this disappointed me a little when compared to my previous phone .  120 hz i didn ' t feel that fluid when compared to 90 hz in my previous phone . ( refresh rate I tried both in dynamic and 120 hz standalone )  I am not a camera person so no comments on that area .####[['display', 'display general', 'neutral', 'average'], ['software', 'software general', 'negative', 'bugs are there with banking apps'], ['Speaker', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'obsolete rubbish'], ['Speaker', 'hardware design_features', 'negative', 'single mono speaker'], ['Speaker', 'hardware quality', 'neutral', 'average quality'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'negative', 'draining fast'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'Sim signals are perfect'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'complete signal almost every time'], ['Haptic', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'motar is rubbish'], ['Haptic', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'worst']]
Over all look and feel it ' s good , if anyone wants to have mobile for normal usage and they can live without curved screen , then I suggest not to go with this .  If you like to use curved display just you can try this .  But apart from curved display this phone is priced very high based on overall performance    And last if you opt for screen damage protection for this phone during service we have to pay an additional 2000 for screen damage .####[['display', 'display design_features', 'neutral', 'curved'], ['phone', 'phone price', 'negative', 'priced very high based on overall performance'], ['look', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'good'], ['feel', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'good']]

Overall wonderful mobile . But it heats up a little during normal operation . Battery backup is very good . Camera is not upto the mark as per price standard . Pictures looks like we have shoot with mid range camera phones . Pixel tends to break a lot with normal zoom which actually occurs with mid range camera mobiles . So I would rate camera 2 / 5 . . . . and other than camera 5 / 5 . Sound was really great . Loud and crispy .####[['mobile', 'phone general', 'positive', 'wonderful'], ['mobile', 'phone usability', 'negative', 'heats up a little during normal operation'], ['Battery backup', 'battery general', 'positive', 'very good'], ['Camera', 'camera general', 'negative', 'not upto the mark as per price standard'], ['Camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'Pixel tends to break a lot with normal zoom'], ['Camera', 'camera general', 'negative', 'Pictures looks like we have shoot with mid range camera'], ['Sound', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'really great'], ['Sound', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'crispy'], ['Sound', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'Loud']]
Overall the phone make and build is poor than vivo X80 ( not X80 pro ) . Performance is as same as X80 . Nothing difference is seen for V2 chip or 9200 chip .

The phone is overall good .  Few things i noted in first 3 days of use :  1 ) battery lasts for an entire day with medium usage .  2 ) speaker output is good and loud .  3 ) still have vivo apps such as - v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled . This should be removed from flagships atleast .  4 ) display is awsome , but LTPO would have been better given the price .  5 ) havent tried heavy gaming , but processor seems capable .  6 ) camera performance is good , but in my old phone i have been using GCAM , so compared to that the stock camera smoothens skin in portrait mode , which i am not a big fan of .  7 ) getting a weird bug , i have JBL Flip 6 , and when its connected , Absolute volume control is not available for some reason . This might be a software bug , but needs to be fixed .####[['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'overall good'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'asts for an entire day with medium usage'], ['speaker', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'loud'], ['speaker', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'output is good'], ['apps', 'software general', 'negative', 'v - appstore , easyshare which cant be hidden or uninstalled'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'awsome'], ['processor', 'cpu general', 'positive', 'seems capable'], ['camera', 'camera operation_performance', 'positive', 'performance is good'], ['software bug', 'software general', 'negative', 'weird bug'], ['software bug', 'software general', 'negative', 'Absolute volume control is not available']]

My first Vivo phone and surely my last one . The display , though AMOLED , comes nowhere near SAMSUNG sAMOLED . The design is prehistoric , especially with the back dated thick bezels .

It is a pic of 10pm today . Everything is perfect the only drawback I found that it doesn ' t come with punch hole display . Selfie camera is very good but not up to the mark as expected . One more thing , Flipkart has written that there is no 3 . 5mm jack but thank God it is available , So don ' t believe on what is written on Flipkart blindly####[['NULL', 'display general', 'negative', "doesn ' t come with punch hole display"], ['Selfie camera', 'camera general', 'neutral', 'very good but not up to the mark as expected'], ['Flipkart', 'platform general', 'negative', "don ' t believe on what is written on Flipkart blindly"]]
1 . The AMOLED display is much inferior if compared with Redmi and Samsung of the same price bracket .  2 . Front Camera sensor is actually 4 mp and photos come noisy if not taken in sufficient light .  3 . Rear camera photos look dull as colour saturation is low , but the 16 mp sensor is good .  4 . 5G runs amazingly fast in this handset .  5 . Single speaker sound output is also low .  6 . The handset is light and handy .####[['AMOLED display', 'display general', 'negative', 'much inferior'], ['Front Camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'photos come noisy if not taken in sufficient light'], ['Rear camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'photos look dull as colour saturation is low '], ['16 mp sensor', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'good'], ['handset', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', '5G runs amazingly fast'], ['Single speaker', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'sound output is also low'], ['handset', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'light and handy']]
