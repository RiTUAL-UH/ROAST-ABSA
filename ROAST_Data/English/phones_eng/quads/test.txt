display is as beautiful as it is risky . As curved display are prone to break and this one doesn ' t have any gorilla glass protection .

I bought this phone in exchange for my S10 lite which has a few issues . So I thought this time to go with the Vivo brand . It has been a few days since I have been using this phone . I can say this phone is quite comfortable to use and the screen size is good .  The display is awesome with a 120hz refresh rate .  The battery is good but I was expecting that the price point should have been 5000mah .  Charging is quite fast .

Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it .

Let ' s face it . The main reason you ' re even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn ' t compromise on power . Getting OS updates for another 4 - 5 years , with a decent camera , waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage .    There ' s a few things it could ' ve done better :    1 . Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage .  2 . The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio .  3 .

This is an amazing phone for the price . For someone coming from a pure Android background , migrating data would take a little time , and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1 - 2 days . Once it is all set , I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup . The backup with the 1800 mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity .  Camera is amazing for my use , as the lighting and colour tone are Natural , close to what we would see with our bare eyes .

This is my first iPhone . And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable . The camera is better in every way . The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame / sec super slow motion recording . Performance is way too better than android . This is fast , very very fast . If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok . In fact this is the only issue with this phone . This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most .

The performance iss as expected great , the battery life is not actually a concern , but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww . Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager , with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20 % left and you could get near to 80 , . Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming , 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season .  Camera is good enough for the price don ' t expect flagship level performance , as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me .  Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros ,  Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features ,  And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .  You can buy this even for the mrp of the phone without hesitation .####[['performance', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'great'], ['battery life', 'battery general', 'negative', 'actually a concern'], ['charging speed', 'battery charging', 'negative', 'soo sloow'], ['Camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'good enough'], ['Speakers', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'great'], ['Speakers', 'hardware quality', 'positive', 'quality is top notch'], ['iphone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'sleek small'], ['iphone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'effective'], ['iphone', 'phone design_features', 'neutral', 'perfectly without any enthusiastic features'], ['ios 14', 'os general', 'positive', 'cool'], ['iphone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'without hesitation']]
I jumped from old SE to the new SE . the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm .  The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design . Looks so good in white colour .  Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU .  If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it . But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed , CAMERA , looks , iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device .  Battery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don’t play games this device is giving me 5 - 6 hrs of usage time ( you tube , camera , music , browsing , etc etc )  M using white colour with product red apple leather case . This is the perfect contrast with white colour .

iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof . .  Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it .  It is good for email surfing , browsing , couple of videos per day .

This is my first iPhone . I would say that coming from Android , there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it .    Coming to the phone itself , camera is amazing minus the low light photography part . Battery backup is ok ok . I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low . Also since I am mostly at home , it doesn’t matter so much . Display is ok . Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse . But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand .    Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run . It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game , battery will tale a hit .####[['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'amazing minus the low light'], ['Battery backup', 'battery general', 'neutral', 'ok ok'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'negative', 'low'], ['Display', 'display general', 'positive', 'ok'], ['Display', 'display general', 'negative', 'small one'], ['Display', 'display design_features', 'negative', 'huge bezels ofcourse'], ['Display', 'display general', 'positive', 'you can reach the entire screen with one hand'], ['iPhone', 'phone price', 'positive', 'great value for money'], ['iPhone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'very capable'], ['iPhone', 'battery general', 'negative', 'any heavy game , battery will tale a hit']]
One of the best handsets , very easy to carry & handle . Exceptional performance & amazing display , however battery is the only concern . It consumes more battery when you use internet , especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures . Otherwise everything thing is perfect . People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this . But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger .####[['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'amazing'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'negative', 'only concern'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'negative', 'consumes more battery when you use internet'], ['handsets', 'phone general', 'positive', 'everything thing is perfect'], ['battery', 'battery charging', 'negative', 'carry a fast charger'], ['handsets', 'phone general', 'positive', 'best'], ['handsets', 'phone usability', 'positive', 'very easy to carry & handle'], ['handsets', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'Exceptional performance']]
Very nice phone . Actually it ' s my first iPhone so I was very excited . Nd I ' m happy with this phone .

It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it , the camera is a beast , the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use , if ur a heavy user you ' d need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get really good game play , worth the money , between if ur coming for a larger screen , you might feel it ' s a lil too small but honestly it ' s not really that small , so buy it , it ' s perfect .####[['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'beast'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'neutral', 'just fine through out the day with mild use'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'neutral', "heavy user you ' d need to charge"], ['NULL', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'performance is epic'], ['NULL', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'so beautiful'], ['NULL', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'really good game play'], ['NULL', 'phone price', 'positive', 'worth the money'], ['screen', 'display design_features', 'neutral', 'not really that small']]
It’s a beast in performance , only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography . Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it , not meant for heavy users . It can handle each and every task very easily . Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it , whether a heavy gameplay or exporting / rendering of heavy videos . Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand . I’ve been using it for more than 9 months . It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above . And it’s my first time experiencing ios , and it is extremely smooth and optimized .

I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary . The user interface and the camera is too good . Just in love with this extraordinary device .

Picture quality is amazing you do not need to think twice about buying this for performance and photos , just go for it .

It ' s a new iPhone ! It ' s faster than the last ones I guess , and it should be good for the next 80k miles . The only gripes I might have , probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS . I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer , and it seems my screen isn ' t nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR . As I ' ve said though , it ' s most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out . Still a nice piece of kit , yet no real surprises either .

Awesome product must buy . Well , switching from Android to iOS will make you a little uncomfortable as Siri can ' t understand Hindi .

The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s . The battery life is longer . And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro ( even on a non - Pro phone ) .  Yes , the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land . But it’s more about what this chip lets you do . This includes Cinematic mode , which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus , and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics .####[['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'brighter'], ['battery life', 'battery general', 'positive', 'longer'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'great'], ['camera', 'camera design_features', 'positive', 'new sensors'], ['camera', 'camera design_features', 'positive', 'computational photography features'], ['A15 Bionic', 'cpu operation_performance', 'positive', 'fastest chip in the land'], ['Cinematic mode', 'cpu general', 'positive', 'adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus'], ['camera', 'camera design_features', 'positive', 'Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics']]

I became first user of I phone . Let ' s start with the design .

Heavy HDR camera performance .####[['camera performance', 'camera general', 'positive', 'Heavy HDR'], ["Apple ' s", 'company general', 'positive', 'enough to  make subtle changes in the design']]

Excellent product . I always had a question why would someone want to invest 50k + on a mobile phone but now my views have changed .  Photos are just amazing its really hard to imagine how good the photos are even in the low light conditions  With A15 chip inside you - can throw any task at it and it will perform without any lag be games or your office work just so easy to work around and switch between multiple apps without getting them close .

Most valuable product . Got this for 66k and its worth enough to spend on premium products . The UI looks super clean and the body got metal on the sides and glass finish on the back .

Apple as always surprises with the fluidity of the UI and the esthetics design , I ' m upgrading from XS to 13 and I ' m not regretting a bit , I mean dont get me wrong XS is a stunning phone after 3 odd years of time with it , never felt sluggish but iPhone 13 is a big jump and a game changer love the design , love the UI and the haptics of course very clean look and feel . I got this phone for 52k which is a big deal on the Big Billion days , Thanks to flipkart the delivey was even more faster as expected .

Just okay , nothing great really . More hype , less substance . Camera is downright disappointing . It’s great on the pro models , but not on this one . Low - light photography is good , but daylight photography is a disaster . Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom . My four - year old Samsung S9 plus produced far superior quality images than this . So I’m really disappointed with the cameras on this phone and repent having payed a fortune for the same . Avoid buying this phone if you are looking for good quality cameras , go for Samsung’s flagship S - series phones instead . This one is more of a show - off .####[['Camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'downright disappointing'], ['cameras', 'camera general', 'negative', 'really disappointed'], ['cameras', 'camera operation_performance', 'negative', 'Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom'], ['cameras', 'camera general', 'positive', 'Low - light photography is good'], ['cameras', 'camera general', 'negative', 'daylight photography is a disaster'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'Avoid buying'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'More hype , less substance'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'nothing great really'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'more of a show - off'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'neutral', 'Just okay']]

It ' s beautiful and apple . but when i look back at my S22 Plus , this feels like a mediocre device from apple . i am not saying it ' s bad , but android is way ahead in terms of performance , battery , camera ( yess , samsung camera is amazing ) and connectivity .  It took me 30 minutes to connect and organize this iPhone to my car but android auto worked like magic and connects in less than 3 seconds . It ' s funny but this is real world data i am talking about . Then there are ads , i have system wide ad block installed on android and on iPhone u can ' t do that . Battery control is alot better on android again due to various software tweaks and it makes ur phone live for 2 days while iPhone is just barely 1 day . Okay enough of it .

After a very long time I switched back to the iPhone . Because I was using android devices since very long time , now I find it bit difficult work with it fluently .

So for a normal budget android user here are my reviews    Camera - just average , the pro models have better camera i guess , back camera is good and takes good pics , but front camera is too average , problem is android phones like redmi has too many gimmicks and it makes you look too attractive ( which is fake ) my wife likes redmi phone####[['Camera', 'camera general', 'neutral', 'average'], ['back camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'good'], ['back camera', 'camera quality', 'positive', 'takes good pics'], ['front camera', 'camera general', 'neutral', 'average']]

It’s my first iPhone and I am very much eager to get it on hand . First impression ya it’s great phone by look . Good weight balance , great optimized chip , and good battery back up . and now the things I am not impress with the price point is it’s display , ya it’s display is good but not up to the mark for the price . and camera samples not even comparable with Samsung A SERIES…I am also using Samsung A 52 .####[['iPhone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'great phone by look'], ['iPhone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'Good weight balance'], ['NULL', 'cpu general', 'positive', 'great optimized chip'], ['battery back up', 'battery general', 'positive', 'good'], ['iPhone', 'phone price', 'negative', 'not impress with the price'], ['display', 'display general', 'neutral', 'good but not up to the mark']]
The iPhone 13 is a fantastic device . The camera system is top - notch , producing beautiful and detailed photos and videos . The A15 Bionic chip provides lightning - fast performance , making multitasking and gaming a breeze . The 5G capability is also a great addition , allowing for faster internet speeds and improved connectivity . The Ceramic Shield front cover provides better durability and drop protection . The battery life is also impressive , lasting throughout the day with moderate use . The only downside is the high price tag . Overall , I highly recommend the iPhone 13 to anyone in the market for a new phone .####[['iPhone 13', 'phone general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['camera system', 'camera general', 'positive', 'top - notch'], ['camera system', 'camera quality', 'positive', 'beautiful and detailed photos and videos'], ['A15 Bionic chip', 'cpu operation_performance', 'positive', 'lightning - fast performance'], ['5G', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'great addition'], ['5G', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'allowing for faster internet speeds'], ['Ceramic Shield', 'hardware quality', 'positive', 'better durability'], ['Ceramic Shield', 'hardware quality', 'positive', 'drop protection'], ['battery life', 'battery general', 'positive', 'impressive'], ['battery life', 'battery general', 'neutral', 'lasting throughout the day with moderate use'], ['iPhone 13', 'phone price', 'negative', 'high price'], ['iPhone 13', 'phone general', 'positive', 'highly recommend']]

The migration from android to IOS is so painful .  First the phone : A solid one , boxy and feels good in hand . Excellent display , camera is good , battery …amazing . For some reason I see that my mobile signal is weak , this was not the case with my android phone .  Second the IOS : I didn’t find it amusing . From a customisation perspective it is probable 5 years behind android . There are certain simple things are missing , it’s a long list . But from a RAM and battery management , it is outstanding . From an user experience perspective , I am really struggling .    Best part is , I got it in sale for a good price after trading in my old phone .####[['phone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'feels good in hand'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'good'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'amazing'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'negative', 'signal is weak'], ['IOS', 'os general', 'negative', 'didn’t find it amusing'], ['RAM', 'memory general', 'positive', 'outstanding'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'outstanding'], ['phone', 'platform prices', 'positive', 'good price']]

I ' ve never owned an iPhone and wanted to transition over after I heard about the spectacular battery life of the 13 Pro Max . I finally pulled the trigger and got it .    Now coming to the phone , it ' s nothing short of amazing . It was a pretty easy transition but that may be because of the fact that I still have an android lying around when I need it . If you ' re sceptical of getting the phone on Flipkart , don ' t be . It ' s a genuine iPhone and the open box delivery system is quite neat    The only downside I see to this phone is the storage . I got the 128 GB model and feel that it is waaay to low if you use the cameras regularly .

Earlier I had plan to go with S23 + but buying a iphone is a personal preference , i have gone through lots of reviews and i came to the conclusion that as a IT person I / we look for smother and faster performance so iphone is significantly better than android .

I have received this product on 18th March , thanks to Flipkart that he product was received very fast . This is the genuine review of the phone which I have felt on my side . The product is overall good enough . The camera I feel little bad , in the day light its ok . . and even in the night we can take the photos but when the light is not good enough the photos are not good . The battery wise is ok i am changing 2 times in a day ( not fully dropped ) . I am using the phone by data connection full time on . The video quality is not upto the mark . I think they will look into that in future updates . Performance wise and display wise no words to say its excellent . So please look into the camera performance and the battery side this is the only request from my side . Thank you moto for giving a best stock Android experience .####[['Flipkart', 'platform general', 'positive', 'product was received very fast'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'overall good'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'negative', 'little bad'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'neutral', 'day light its ok'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'negative', 'light is not good enough the photos are not good'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'neutral', 'ok'], ['camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'video quality is not upto the mark'], ['Performance', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'excellent']]
I ' ve had a fantastic experience with Motog73 so far . I could not imagine these many features in a phone ( particularly in this price range ) , and the camera really steals the show with its 2micron 50MP imaging system . This phone produces visually captivating , lively , colorful , and stunning images straight out of the box so I won ' t have to spend time making a lot of changes . The night light also captures incredible pictures without any blurring areas . When it comes to taking pictures , it comfortably beats my friend ' s oneplus phone which is famous for its camera . The colors are very vibrant and eye - catching . and the display is legible even in bright sunlight . Playing games and watching movies is another enjoyable experience on g73 . In terms of daily performance also , the phone is quick and smooth . I ' ve been using it for over a week now and the experience has been wonderful !####[['Motog73', 'phone general', 'positive', 'fantastic experience'], ['camera', 'camera design_features', 'positive', 'steals the show with its 2micron 50MP imaging system'], ['camera', 'camera operation_performance', 'positive', 'produces visually captivating'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'lively'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'colorful'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'stunning images'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'night light also captures incredible pictures'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'without any blurring areas'], ['display', 'display quality', 'positive', 'colors are very vibrant'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'eye - catching'], ['display', 'display operation_performance', 'positive', 'legible even in bright sunlight'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'enjoyable experience'], ['performance', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'quick'], ['performance', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'smooth'], ['Motog73', 'phone general', 'positive', 'experience has been wonderful']]
The phone is excellent , very smooth and easy to run . Camera has massively improved as per Motorola standards but the . LCD display , used in sunlight to see , it is not bad but not something that will make you happy . Average is the word . I do not play games so no comments . I played music , the sound is crisp and very pleasant . Phone calls are good . 5G works very well . There is a very good option to protect 5g from draining your data , phone puts you on 4g . Bloatware has started off , it is not the kind the earlier generation of Moto g . But manageable unlike Realme , Redmi etc . Android 13 is great . Sadly you will get just one update .####[['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['phone', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'very smooth'], ['phone', 'phone usability', 'positive', 'easy to run'], ['Camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'massively improved'], ['display', 'display general', 'neutral', 'Average'], ['sound', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'crisp'], ['sound', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'very pleasant'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'calls are good'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', '5G works very well'], ['phone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'very good option to protect 5g from draining your data'], ['Bloatware', 'software general', 'positive', 'started off']]

Not a good product . I bought it as it was advertised for 2 micrometer camera which just turned out to be a hype . Camera is just average .    This phone does not support 5g at the moment . Not sure when company is releasing update to support 5g .    Better to go for poco x4 pro which is at same price banfld with amoled panel and is 5 g ready    Motorola has released a half baked product which does not seem to justify the price .####[['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'Not a good'], ['Camera', 'camera general', 'neutral', 'average'], ['phone', 'phone connectivity', 'negative', 'does not support 5g'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'negative', 'does not seem to justify the price']]
Product is awesome in this price range .  Camera performance is good because of its ultra pixel technology and ultrawide lens is too good in this price range as it work as macro and depth sensor which gives more details and no other brand is providing ultrawide lens in this range .  Type C To C charger is provided in the box which is good  Processor is also good as it provide smooth experience in gaming and also It has 120hz refresh rate which is dynamic .

At first thanks to Flipkart for delivery in 1day.  Performance of this phone is very good and smooth. I feel it's really 120z. No Network issues in my Village always show 4G+ signal. Clean UI and stock Android.  Secure folder is available. One thing that I miss i.e theme because you can't customise your phone with various types of themes and wallpaper. You only use system wallpaper and theme.  There is no available gallery, file management, Music player apps like other brand phones. All apps are working with Google products.  Video quality is good HDR supported.####[]
ve been using the Moto G73 5G for a while now, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its performance. The phone has a large 6.5-inch screen with a high refresh rate that makes scrolling through apps and websites smooth and seamless. The 5G connectivity is also a big plus, as I can easily stream videos, make video calls, and download large files without any lag.  The phone's battery life is impressive, lasting me through a full day of moderate to heavy usage. I also appreciate the phone's fast charging capabilities, which allow me to top up the battery quickly when needed.####[]

The review I am writing after 10 days of usage . The initial impression is really good . The display is crystal clear and is soft on eyes . Functioning of phone is very smooth .  I am yet to explore the phone fully but the basic usage has satisfied me a lot and some very useful features of phone , like karate chop switching on of torch light , twist and open the camera are very handy . 10 days of use is quite less to write an extensive review but it gives an idea of the quality of product to an extent .  Overall seems to me a good buy and value for money . I prefer separate slot for SDCard and as this phone has a hybrid slot for sim cards and SDCard so I have to adjust with this shortcoming for my preference .####[['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'initial impression is really good'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'crystal clear'], ['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'soft on eyes'], ['phone', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'Functioning of phone is very smooth'], ['phone', 'phone design_features', 'positive', 'very useful features'], ['camera', 'camera general', 'positive', 'very handy'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'good buy'], ['phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'value for money']]

I ordered Moto G73 on 16th March which was delivered to me on 18th March . I would like to share that its battery life is really pathetic . Even if the phone is not in use , the battery drains very fast . It has happened a couple of times now that the battery was at around 55 % at 11 pm ( when I put the phone on DND ) .

Moto disappointed with this device , battery drains like anything , this is the core requirement for me but what I can do .  I have seen many reviews regarding battery issues , but didn ' t consider , TRUSTED THE BRAND .  Display is good , CPU consumes more battery while doing some sort of heavy operations like app install , update install .

If your budget is 7000 then believe me this is the best choice , I ' m writing this review after one month use . over all performance is good . No lag during free fire at smooth graphics , No fingerprint sensor but its okey bcoz they already provided many features . 5000 mAh battery is amazing . it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use . and one day at highest use . I played free fire for 30 min and Amazing thing that battery used is only 5 % . this a the real value for money phone , full paisa wasul phone . also supports VoLTE calling and WiFi . big screen .####[['NULL', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'over all performance is good'], ['screen', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'No fingerprint sensor'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'battery quality', 'positive', 'amazing'], ['5000 mAh battery', 'battery general', 'positive', "it last ' s 3 days to me at normal use"], ['5000 mAh battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'one day at highest use'], ['NULL', 'phone connectivity', 'positive', 'supports VoLTE calling and WiFi'], ['screen', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'big'], ['NULL', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'No lag'], ['screen', 'display quality', 'positive', 'smooth graphics'], ['NULL', 'phone price', 'positive', 'real value for money'], ['NULL', 'phone general', 'positive', 'best choice']]
Haven ' t got any complaints overall , good built quality , display is vibrant enough and bright , battery life is on the better side , lasts a while . It can feel a bit slow and take some time to load apps up but that ' s to be expected with a 2 GB RAM The camera could ' ve been better , it takes great vibrant photos but bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details . Not very fond of the audio unit , music sounds way harsh without any bass or the finer sounds .####[['NULL', 'phone quality', 'positive', 'good built quality'], ['display', 'display quality', 'positive', 'vibrant enough'], ['display', 'display quality', 'positive', 'bright'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'life is on the better side'], ['battery', 'battery quality', 'positive', 'lasts a while'], ['NULL', 'phone operation_performance', 'negative', 'It can feel a bit slow'], ['2 GB RAM', 'memory general', 'negative', 'take some time to load apps up'], ['2 GB RAM', 'memory general', 'neutral', "but that ' s to be expected"], ['camera', 'camera general', 'negative', "could ' ve been better"], ['camera', 'camera quality', 'positive', 'it takes great vibrant photos'], ['camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'bit sloppy on the sharpness and the details'], ['NULL', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'Not very fond of the audio unit '], ['NULL', 'hardware quality', 'negative', 'music sounds way harsh without any bass']]
I got it for 6 . 5k and at that price point it ' s Recommended . I have used it for More than 6 months now .

If you want a smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media . This is a very good option for you . I bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want a phone for calling purpose . This has only 2 gb of ram so don ' t think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won ' t run very smooth under above normal conditions . There is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash . But the battery is 4000mah and has considerably high battery life . There is no fast charging only normal charger is given . So in my opinion this is a phone for a below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media .####[['camera', 'camera quality', 'negative', 'trash'], ['battery', 'battery charging', 'negative', 'no fast charging'], ['NULL', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'normal charger is given'], ['smart phone', 'phone general', 'positive', 'very good option'], ['ram', 'memory general', 'neutral', '2 gb'], ['smart phone', 'phone operation_performance', 'negative', "won ' t run very smooth"], ['fingerprint sensor', 'phone general', 'negative', 'no'], ['battery', 'battery general', 'positive', 'high battery life']]
Bought it for ₹6799 . Still working proper after 2 years . Battery life on normal usage is about 1 - 1½ days , if used only for making calls then about 5 - 6 days .

It ' s good for a secondary phone .####[['phone', 'phone quality', 'positive', 'Still working proper after 2 years'], ['Battery', 'battery quality', 'positive', 'on normal usage is about 1 - 1½ days'], ['UI', 'software general', 'negative', 'crappy slow'], ['phone', 'phone operation_performance', 'positive', 'run normal games with ease']]

I bought this phone for my mom . She ' s been using this phone since an year . I always buy redmi because they ' ve gained my trust . My first phone was redmi 5 A and current one is redmi 10 prime . They performed well and i purchased this phone on that trust , but shockingly , the phone was utter disappointment . My mom is a very light user . She only uses phone for calling and youtube . But the phone is not responding even for simple tasks . It takes almost 15 seconds to open the camera . I resetted the phone , updated software , everything but of no use . Never expected this from a trustful brand like redmi . I suggest you guys to take little more priced phones from redmi , entry level phones are poor in performance .
