I ' m still disappointed with the " lower sodium " label . f course you will get less sodium if you decrease the amount in the cup by 50 % ! he large Mc Dougall soup cups contain two servings typically - have you tried to share one or keep it for another day ? My solution is to use about 3 / 4 of the " seasoning packet " ( assuming that the sodium is there and not in the dried flakes ) . he flavor and texture are still good . I wish their advertising was more transparent - it would make me trust the company a little more .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

Before I had a Keurig I would order Raspberry Latte ' s from Starbucks for $ 4 each . With this coffee I make them at home for about 50 cents .

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy . Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers .####[['food general', 'negative']]

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth . I do not understand why these are so hard to find , as even other web shops appear to no longer carry these , it ' s a shame : (####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'negative']]
I really love these . After trying many different brands I decided that this is my favorite . They are soft and fresh - tasting , and also come with lots of liquid . They are also from domestically caught fish , and even though canned in Asia , the cans are BPA - free which is not common in the industry . The lemon juice helps a great deal with keeping your breath fresh ( usually an issue with sardines ) and the lemon slice found in each can is an added and very enjoyable bonus .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I have a Bernese Mountain Dog . The food is good quality and my dog eats it as fast as possible . His coat is shiny and he doesn ' t have any digestive issues .

A friend recommended I try this and it was very good tasting coffee . A smooth after taste and a kind of woodsey flavor . Some other coffees I have found that are great are the Wegman ' s dark roast espresso beans ( which I brew lightly ) and also the medium roast regular coffee at panera Bread . Just thought I would throw that in as a bonus . LOLNice coffee .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I know that the Happy Family rice cakes say 7 + months , but I wanted my kids ( ages 3 and 2 years old ) to try them .

I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X - Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock . The Slim Jims have a good flavor , but they are far more greasy , and their casing is tough , like eating wax paper . They are also a bit more " dried out " in consistency .

These don ' t taste like cardboard , thankfully ; they have a pleasant , subtle almost nutty flavor , as if peanut butter is in them .

I usually have these after dinner and its pretty nice . Doesn ' t have a clean ( refreshing ) after taste as I would have expected from a herbal mint tea but its fairly ok .

I like the fact that its herbal and does not have caffein in it . a tremendous flavor . hot enough to make you break a sweat . the best sauce that i have ever used . not for the timid . my first time in famous dave ' s restaurant , i knew this was for me . the price through amazon is a great savings .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]

If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) . The tea ' s flavor is dominated by ginger , and some lemongrass , with barely any green tea taste . That ' s right , not lemon , but lemongrass . Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled " lemon ginger green tea . It doesn ' t necessarily have a bad taste , just an unexpected one . If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor , i prepare this with another plain green tea bag .####[['food quality', 'neutral']]
The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all . Chicory is not coffee , hence no caffeine , which is either good or bad , depending on your preference . Overall , I like the flavor , just be careful when you start to make it . If you put in the same quantities as regular coffee , it will turn out like syrup .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Excellent , simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised . I consider it to be a medium roast / breakfast blend kind of coffee . If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this " soup " tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
If you like this kind of thing , then this is the brand for you .

I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon . My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico , One , then Vita Coco . Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said , I will pass on that . I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably . I would rate this behind One for taste .

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the " default " brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['food general', 'positive']]

While saving money is a key factor in purchasing this , I am basing my review on the taste of the product . Overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged K - cups .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I think this is a good powder for people who don ' t like stuff that is sweet - I couldn ' t really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all , so for me this doesn ' t work as a standalone protein powder .

It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way .

Please be aware that one of the cans that I purchased in late August 2011 exploded in my cupboard . This indicates a potential health risk to consuming the contents . Information printed on the can bottom identifies the batch , as follows : " 1219BestBy05Dec2012 , 1035 C3 340 10 . If your can is deformed , consider discarding orreturning it , rather than eating it . Also , aside from the problem of exploding , 1 / 2 cup of this product contains 860 mg of Sodium . The amount that I ate in another can was way too salty for my taste and amounts to more than half of my personal limit of 1500 mg Sodium per day .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
Even though I hate sugar in any coffee beverage , this is pretty good . At 45 calories a can , there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar . That ' s kinda hefty , but it doesn ' t taste that sweet .

I was very disappointed by the product . They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe .

I keep ordering this product because they add so much to my baking . They are always fresh , delicious , and beautiful .

I do love the original Cheetos Cheese Puffs , but not the fact my fingers end up covered with the orange - colored coating on the puffs . I have eaten several bags of Barbara ' s Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor . They have a light crispy crunch to them and can be eaten without a beverage as they do not seem dry to my mouth . It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them , but I found them to be a delicious , non - filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind . I will certainly order them again in the future .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them . We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags . The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal . The chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt . They have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients . What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip ! i was introduced to these chips by a friend . i couldnt find them local , so i got them here . they are the BEST chips super addicting . even my sister who gags at the taste of onions LOVES these chips . the delivery was speedy and it is well worth ordering a box . super tasty !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'positive']]

I ' m a bit of a cinnamon junky and have collected many variants of this tasty treat . There are a few better products but still I keep coming back to McCormick as it has been consistently good . The last couple orders of Indus Organics and Spicy World cinnamon I bought from Amazon had all the flavor of hardwood flooring ( these are much more expensive products ) . I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea .

This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried . At first she seemed to like it , and she ate it well .

This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts , tree nuts , eggs , and soy . It would be really nice if Amazon required allergen statements on grocery items since its policy is that it does not allow returns on groceries . I don ' t really like hurting a product ' s ratings , but the vendor can certainly ( and SHOULD ) include this sort of critical information about the product ' s contents . All you have to do is upload a photo of the label . Anyhow , if you have severe food allergies to these substances , be forewarned .

My cat loves this food . Contains white meat shredded chicken in broth - no grains , no vegetables . Also , it is BPA free .

I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast , nicely mannered , moderate taste to offer just about everyone . Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake - up . Good for an afternoon " Kaffeestunde " entertainment . But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker , oily , stronger flavor coffee bean . The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at .

Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans , my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store - bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them . On this food for years , my cats are shiny , never gassy , never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder , and their poop ain ' t sweet but seems less foul than when on other food . Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it ' s not in any stores . It ' s not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ( $ 90 including shipping ) lasts me about 12 weeks , so under $ 4 a week per cat , maybe $ 2 more than Purina , $ 1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro .####[['food prices', 'negative']]

I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office . Unfortunately , even with sugar as ingredient # 1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient # 2 , Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose ( a sugar substitute , Splenda equivalent ) as a final ingredient . That makes for a nasty , saccharin - y , hypersweet and artificial aftertaste . Nasty . Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss .

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

Great cookies . These are very crunchy . Not at all soft . Very nice taste .

The product quality is great , but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D ' Oro brand due to the ongoing strike .

Since the cost of this product is $ 47 . 95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages , make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D ' Oro before ordering .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'negative']]

We have been using this brand of maple syrup for over 6 years . The B grade has more minerals than A grade .

I got into Larabars , because I am trying to eat more natural , less packaged food . Yes Larabars come in a package , but they do not have any preservatives , chemicals , or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce . Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients .

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]
Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix .

I was raised in Michigan and had fresh rhubarb pie on a regular basis . This particular recipe is pretty good , and makes a very good pie . I could of course compare it to my grandmother ' s pie and be critical , but instead just say that if you have not had rhubarb pie in a while , or never had it , this is one of the best and easiestways to re - introduce or introduce you to this wonderful pie . My wife called Barry Farm prior to cooking the pie , and they were very nice and helpful with cooking and serving hints . Good filling , great customer service !

My mother had a major surgery and since my sisters and I live out of state we wanted to give her something extra special to help cheer her up . I ordered this basket , being the largest one , paid a hefty price and even paid the extra money to have it overnighted . She received it the next afternoon at 2 : 30 , which is rather late for the extra $ 30 I was charged . Though the basket was pretty the yummies were described by my sister staying with her as , dry and tasteless . That made me really sad because I really wanted something extra special####[['food prices', 'negative'], ['shipment prices', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

Twinings English Breakfast tea is much better than any of the teas generally available in US shops .

I have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease for eight years now , and this is the first product I have found that actually replaces flour . I have been able to make ANY recipe using this product as a 1 : 1 replacement and it works , and more importantly , tastes , GREAT ! ! Purchasing it here at Amazon is much cheaper than the health food stores , too . For those of you who have been gluten free for a long time , I might caution you to take it easy when introducing this product to your diet .

The previous review , faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness , is accurate , and I was at first equally disappointed . But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice , much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it . This works ! I microwave a slice ( a little tough to cut , but I use a sharp knife and keep my fingers safe ) on high heat for about seven seconds . It softens , becomes easily chewed , and the flavor comes out fully . I ' ve become addicted !####[['food general', 'positive']]

This olive oil so far is great . I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet . However , it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill . As for the taste , it is very light and a bit nutty . Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level . For the price , one should certainly try it out .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
I did my research and found ( at the time of purchase ) that buying this case was cheaper than buying the individual items at my local Wal - Mart . Being wheat they ' re healthier than normal pasta .

Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock . Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel . Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish . I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap . I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping . More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description . If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS .####[['food general', 'positive']]

If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement .

I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet .

It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months .

The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
These are hands down the best pretzels I ' ve ever had . Since having to be gluten free , I ' ve tried other brands , but truly prefer these .

We get large bags of mixed frozen fruit , fill a Vita - Mix to nearly the 1250ml line , add water just to the top of the fruit sometimes we add mixed berries with the fruit ) , then add the Nutiva Hemp Protein Powder ( we use a heaping scoop ) . Sometimes we also add in some chocolate mix , sometimes a little maple syrup , it just depends . There ' s a distinct but not bad taste at all , and it cuts the " just fruit " taste of the smoothie . We buy it mainly for the nutritional specs , not the taste , but don ' t find the taste at all disagreeable , ourselves . We ' ve also tried the chocolate version - GREAT taste .####[['food quality', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

My advice is not to let the people who describe this horseradish sauce as mild fool you .

We ' re fans of the " brown lid , " natural - style , peanut butters . and Skippy doesn ' t disappoint . The peanut flavor is strong , there ' s no oil separation ( so no stirring is necessary ) and the texture is very creamy / smooth . As far as differences between this and the " natural " offerings of other brands , as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can ' t tell a difference . so we don ' t mind changing it up with whatever is on sale . That said , as long as Amazon continues to carry this 6 - pack at a reasonable price with their S & S program , I anticipate that we ' ll continue to enjoy it .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]
After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure , he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill ' s Science Diet k / d dry food , but he was vomiting it up regularily . Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot ' s Stew . My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken , turkey and salmon varieties . Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots , peas and green beans , but he does eat them . I really like that Spot ' s Stew is an all natural cat food with no by - products or fillers , and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint . According to the label , this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk . It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber . For 210 or 250 calories , I think it should have more flavor , but for those who don ' t like any sugar in cereal , this works out well , especially if they prefer a high - fiber one . Personally , I wouldn ' t purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'neutral']]
If you enjoy flavored coffee and like dark chocolate this is the coffee for you . The chocolate flavor is super rich .

If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices . Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian ( or Caribbean ) curry dish , the soup is still a delicious meal . As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate ( MSG ) , I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive . The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30 % ; however , most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile .

This turned out to be a very tasty dish . It says just add beef , but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over , there is quite a bit of sauce . It has a thick spicy curry flavor and I found the longer the rice sat in it the better the taste  so you might want to add the cooked rice right to the pan instead of over the top . Very good , will make this again . this is my drink of choice . I ' m addicted . I drink 3 - 4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good . I ' ve tried other chai - spice teas ; none of them compare . The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it , raising the prices . You should try it , it ' s good .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
This Caponata is delicious and works on so many things . My favorite way is so simple . just on saltine crackers . Also , if you shred up some parmesean or similar cheese and sprinkle it on top .

Nabisco ' s Newtons Fruit Thins are an interesting creation , and they were nice to sample . I like the flavor - - it ' s mild , not super - sweet and would actually be a great choice to have with coffee or tea . The fig pieces are a little hard , but I suppose I ' d rather them at that texture than to be super - soft . The package has lots of servings , so one purchase should last you a while . Based on my experience with this flavor , I ' d like to try the others as well .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I LOVE the all - natural , high - protein profile of this bar - it has 16g protein in 160 calories . . .

Our dogs ' diet is largely people food as my brother spends his day cooking . However , we always put out a bowl of good dry dog food for them when they aren ' t interested in our meals ( been on a low red meat quick lately to keep the cholesterol under control ) . Although the ingredients aren ' t quite as good as the premium brand I ' ve been giving them , I certainly don ' t consider it poison as some reviewers have stated . If soybeans are good enough for menopausal women , why would you think it ' s going to harm your dog ? It might cause bloating but it won ' t kill them . So I give it a three as adequate and the dogs seemed to enjoy it .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman ' s Advanced Dog formula . I like this better than the regular Newman ' s , because it has less ingredients .

Since Larry ' s Beans is no longer an option , I had been searching for an adequate substitute . This blend fits the bill !

Delicious ! Amazon is the only place I ' ve been able to find grade B maple syrup in reasonably small containers . It has considerably more intense maple flavor than grade A .

Finally , someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor . If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil , top 3 being french fries , donuts and potato chips . Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it ' s fried .

I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say . The coffee inside was good , as well . However , to break it down - - it was one of the smoothest coffees I ' ve ever had , like drinking silk . The flavor was mild , pleasant , but for me , the taste was too bland , did not stand out .

Since cats are obligate carnivores , high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy . When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain , useless fillers and by - products from their formulas . My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more . Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new . This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K - cup product before it was released . When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order .

The individual K - cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage .

My dog was sick for 2 months and lost 20 % of her body weight . Her coat was falling out in clumps and she was still barely eating , eventhough the vet couldn ' t figure out what was wrong with her .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar - induced drinks , and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners , it tastes pretty good ! Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint . But the key is dumping some rum in there . Where I come from , a mojito isn ' t a mojito if it ' s not making you dizzy , and some rum will achieve that effect very nicely . Sure , the drink tastes fine without it , but this achieves new heights once you agree to spice it up .

It ' s good , really good !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

We sent this selection of Six Mackinac " Fudge Slices " to my daughter ' s college dorm as a bit of comfort food at the start of the new semester . My daughter reports that all of the flavors are indeed " yummy " and they were very much appreciated by her roommates as well . The shipping from Mackinac was exceptionally fast with the fudge arriving well ahead of the estimated delivery date . Highly Recommended !

I bought this product , remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage . To my surprise , the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet . Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup , and the difference is obvious . Ferrara : sugar , water , almond extract , citric acid , artificial color , 1 / 10th of 1 % sodium benzoate ( as preservative ) Monin : Pure cane sugar , water , natural almond flavorI rest my case .####[['food quality', 'negative']]

Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label . The dosage amount of Glucosamine / Chondroitin is vague . It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine . Too expensive for me .

If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere .####[['food prices', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I have been enjoying this green tea immensely - being an avid green tea drinker and knowing there had to be more to green tea than the ' bag ' I researched it and found matcha .

I have found these to be convenient when on long road trips , or in small spaces such as a on a plane . However , while they are convenient bottles , they do not come with the nipple and so you will need to remember to bring that along . Also the bottle tends to leak . It may be because of the nipple I am using is not the recommended nipple . All in All , I do recommend them for on the go but they are not something I would recommend for everyday use .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them . She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis . Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things .

I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor . The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container , just paper .

Alas , we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore .####[['food general', 'positive']]

This is a decaffienated version of Stash ' s chai spice tea , made from blended black teas , ginger , cinnamon , allspice , nutmeg , cloves , and natural flavors of cinnamon , clove , and cardamom . Many chai spice teas ( which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener ) nauseate me , but this one did not - - - I loved it ! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation , and enjoyable cup of tea . I brewed the tea as I always do , leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3 - 5 minutes recommended brewing time , and the tea never turned bitter , just got stronger and tastier ! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version , but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

This has been our favorite chili for years , and we ' ve tried many . We ' ve even thrown away a partial case of another brand bought at a big box store .

I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola .

It ' s pretty sub - par granola . These are ok snacks but I like other granola bars better .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'neutral']]

If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do , you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper , albeit beautiful , since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna .

I bought several bottles of Pickapeppa sauce on my recent trip home and picked up a single bottle of this as an afterthought .

I was cautious about buying this product after reading several negative reviews about it , but I went ahead and bought it anyway because I wanted to try different sorts of flavored coffee . When I received my package I was pleasantly surprised ! I ordered the 35 K - Cup pack . I received all 35 cups in 25 different flavors which don ' t expire until mid - April . The cups arrived in a normal shipping box - nothing fancy , but it protected the cups from being ruined .

This is the best green tea I have run across , cause they say we got a drink it , you know ? It has a fresh mild taste , but does not have that grassy taste like you ' re drinking something that was part of your lawn . Therefore you can drink a bunch of these through the day without upsetting your stomach like with coffee . I think the instant hot water makes it taste better than tea bags in the microwave . A box shows up really fast UPS if you have Prime Shipping .

This is amazing salt ! A friend brought me my first bag from the Cook Islands . It is light and very nice on the tooth . I wish I could buy it in 5 lb bags . The best use so far , steam young potatos , flatten on a sheet pan drench with olive oil ( I infuse mine with garlic ) and sprinkle liberally with this salt and bake hot ( 400 * convection ) until brown . It is a great finishing salt for meats too !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I love these cereal bars . the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite . They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein .

They are sweet but not overwhelmingly so , with the taste of honey being very perceptible . The bars aren ' t " honey golden " in color as many supposedly honey products tend to be nowadays , but I see that as a good thing , because that color usually comes from caramel and burned sugar , not honey .

We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight . The ingredients seemed great , but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5 - 7 times per day ! The food did little to help with weight reduction ( even with all the vomiting ) , and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian - prescribed food instead . Note : Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem . ) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food , his stool has become firmer and less frequent , and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis . As I stated above , the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious , but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'negative']]

We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2 - 3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed .

This tea has a pleasant cinnamon like aroma and has a cinnamony / Carob like flavor . It take longer to brew but is worth it ! It takes the edge off stress and is an enjoyable tea for morning or nightime !

If this were just a good tasting , better for you than the sugar and caffeine bombs little drink , it would be great . The problem with it is the mystical IQ enhancing promise .

I support a local animal shelter , too which I provide food monthly . By ordering in bulk , not only do I save money but it helps my budget in contributing to saving animals lives .

I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned . We didn ' t know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life . We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout . We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well . Definitely a great find .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I should have saved my money , but curiosity got the best of me . I did not have great expectations for this product , but when it arrived , I was surprised to see how small the gumballs were , that when chewed became pretty small in the mouth .

Our son only eats hot dogs some thought we would try making some . We used a frankfurter recipe and ground chicken . These casings , while gross , are easy to untangle , clean , and feed onto the machine . After cooking they tasted delicious and didn ' t get gummy or gross like the gelatin type .

These are great for making larger portions of baby food . I think I ' ll use them more as my baby gets older . For my 7 - month - old , one cube makes about 2 - 3 servings of food for her . I love that it has a cover , and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out . But , it ' s pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food , and the fewer slots make it harder to mass - produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
I originally purchased this for my kids but they wouldn ' t drink it . They don ' t know what they ' re missing because this stuff is great .

Have used the sugar - free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now . Just got this 3 - pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different ; and not in a good way if you liked the original . The new product is quite ' artificial ' tasting .

I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor . All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .####[['food quality', 'negative']]

I have several favorite recipes that use tomato paste , but they many of them only use a couple of tablespoon .

Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt ! I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts . This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet , in moderation .

We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it .

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as " generous .

Our cat doesn ' t like the feline Pill Pockets so much , but he loves these canine beef ones .

My family devoured this batch and I ' m buying more . They taste nutty and chocolatey , and have protein in them and stop the afternoon hunger pangs .

The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are " All Natural " really , really , really upsets me . These chips , and many other Kettle chips , contain " yeast extract . On a chemical level , yeast extract is the same thing as MSG ; it ' s just derived from a different source .

We drink a lot of tea in our household - black , green , white and a variety of herbal . This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh . We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor . If microwaving your water , make sure it gets good and hot to get the most out of your teabag ; if the water isn ' t hot enough , the flavor is a little weak .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
I cooked noodle soups using the chicken soup as the base . The chicken soup turned out to be a little salty . I added noodles and vegetables into the soup without adding extra salt .

Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried , these by far are the best . They are close to the real thing as I recall . Sometimes they are difficult to obtain .

I managed to taste this before purchasing and I have to say , in taste and character , it is easily equal to its non - decaffeinated counterparts . It makes a hearty cup with no bitter aftertaste .

Planters Peanut Butter Cookie Crisps 100 Calorie Packs , 6 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) . These cookies are so tasty ! I love the peanut taste and the crispness .

Like the first reviewer , I too was surprised to get a box ( no inner box at all ) of loose k cups . There was a cardboard tube in the middle of the box to keep them from rolling around too much , but one was wrinkled so badly it almost fell apart .

I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten - free diet . They taste great !

I love this coconut water - - it ' s naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water ( but not too much ) . My only " complaint " is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $ 22 - 23 on Amazon a few months ago , signing up for the regular delivery . Now , it is listed as " not available " for the regular delivery , but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $ 38 ( also a 12 - pack , same brand , same size per can ) .

I ' ve not tasted the original version but the hazelnut blend is delicious . There was a bit of oil separation at the top but not as much as you get with most natural nut butters .

It ' s difficult to find Bob ' s Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area , so I have this product auto - shipped to my home , and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes . Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease . Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain , the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all - purpose white wheat flour , but we haven ' t found the differences to be objectionable . I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good alternative to wheat flour .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'negative']]

I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years . PB2 isn ' t a perfect replacement for peanut butter  but it has a natural taste to it , is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile . I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product . When turning PB2 into peanut butter , don ' t add too much water , or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted . In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread , I also put PB2 powder in smoothies , on cereal and with oatmeal .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

Quality of the peanuts are okay ( on a quality rating scale of okay , good and fine ) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest I have found in my local grocery chains .

I got this as a gift . I didn ' t think I ' d like it as I am not much of a coffee drinker . Mixed with a splash of skim milk and some artificial sweetener this was the best coffee I ' ve had in a long time ! we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened . They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products . With speculation on them keeping the same recipe , we orderd a jar and were not disappointed ! ! The product was exactly what we had remembered the original King B to be . I will definetly be ordering this again ! !####[['food general', 'positive']]

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . I ' m assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . Regardless , I would never purchase this product again because I don ' t want to risk my cats getting sick from it . We are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we ' re trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]

First of all , I hate buying bottled water because I feel like it ' s such a rip off when I can take a good hydroflask water bottle , fill it with tap water and ice cubes , and have long - lasting cold water . However , I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water . I can ' t really speak to the " healthiness " of it , but on pure taste alone , I would buy this water for a refreshing drink . The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth ! This is stating the obvious , but it tastes better cool or cold and when it ' s at that temperature , I could not detect any aftertaste .

When I read the reviews , I noticed someone mentioned the box was light . It is , but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact ; they expand when cooked  so there ' s a lot more in the box than it looks like .

I have tried many different brands of choco covered espresso beans , from amazon to the local coffee shops . hese are far superior to any I have tried to date . here is only a small amount of dark chocolate ( which is what I like , less calories more caffeine ) and the espresso bean has a great taste basically the bean melts in your mouth . I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . hese are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]

My mom turned me on to Alba milkshakes in the ' 70s and I remember them tasting pretty good . I was thrilled to find them on Amazon after all these years .

I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years , and I have been very pleased ! Recently I have discovered Amazon ' s auto - shipment of the dog food which is great , since the stores that sell it is quite a drive . My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems ( as many cockers do ) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food , after doing research , I decided on holistic select instead , and his ears are so much better ! hey went from " chronic " to just irritated , and the vet was very pleased with his improvement . He loves this food , and would eat it constantly if I let him ! I would recommend this dog food to anyone !####[['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
Charlee Bear treats are only three calories a piece , which is a important to us since our dog loves treats but we have weight concerns . With these little bites , he ' s happy and we ' re happy , and we can give them more often than the bigger size biscuits . hey are great for training rewards too since they aren ' t calorie laden . My dogs finds them very tasty and they are made from stuff I can understand , no chemistry lab full of ingredients .

I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store . he packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat . However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away . he size ranged from extra large ( maybe 15 % ) to small ( most of these unopened ) . In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands . he person in charge of quality control was probably at the dentist getting their chipped tooth fixed after trying to open some of these nuts .####[['shipment quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . hese are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo . You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price , which is a big plus . A big downside for adults is that the blue / purple colors turn your tongue blue , and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush . he Haribo ' s don ' t have that side effect . As far as the fancy flavors go , that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors , in my opinion .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]

I LOVE funnel cakes but was afraid this would not taste like the real thing at carnivals . friends and family LOVED it ! Only problem I had was it comes in one bag so have to use all batter at once ( or split in half doses and just estimate how much water is needed ) , but they all had no problem eating more than one or two funnel cakes that night ! definitely purchase this brand !####[['food general', 'positive']]

I got this popcorn in order to make caramel corn . Most , if not all , of the kernels are fully popped , which is a huge improvement over microwave and other home - popped corn . I am also really happy with the light and fluffy texture . The flavor is very subtle , which is perfect for making caramel corn or adding your own seasonings . At first I thought the popcorn had no flavor of its own ; but the more of it I eat , the more I appreciate it plain .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack . These are ok , but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting , there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor . Also , the serving size doesn ' t seem like that much since the cookies are very thin . For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers , which are much more tasty and satisfying . If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid , go for the Elfin Crackers , they are very similar in flavor .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

Why does Ambrosoli - HoneesEnergy have " added " Vitamins with the first DOMINANT ingredients being SUGAR and CORN SYRUP ? With the natural antioxidants , enzymes , vitamins , and energizers provided by bees through [ [ B003SO9QZA : RAW ] ] honey , it is questionable why this processed food was heated with contains added stuff .

This is not a great green tea . It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion .

This is very yummy with a smooth and creamy texture and a subtle hint of pumpkin .

After having to give up coffee , I have been trying many coffee " replacements " such as this Kaffree Roma .

Great healthy snack in a variety of flavors . This box will be a great addition to your pantry , kitchen counter , and emergency kit !

If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement .

It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months .

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed .

Love these resealable bags , since Pandas do tend to dry out . this is the problem i find with the boxes , even after you close them properly .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]

I really liked the taste of this drink - it reminded me of a cherry soda . There was no aftertaste and it did seem to give me more energy to get through the part of the day that just drags on . I also thought it worked fairly quickly . I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings , at approximately 130 calories each , so it ' s definitely not a diet - friendly drink . Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda , for me , it ' s just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis . That said , I would drink it again and I would recommend the drink to people who are looking for energy drinks or don ' t mind the calories ( and sugar ) .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
This rice is a nice change from the traditional white rice I find in the local grocery , primarily because it ' s sticky . When reheated it tastes as good as it did when first prepared .

It still seems freshly cooked 3 days later .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

Without a doubt , this is hands down the best coconut water product I ' ve tried .

I bought this item in ' Mocha ' flavor and it is YUMMYYY ! It replaces my daily morning coffee and it especially good after a workout .

I ' ll be buying it over and over , it tastes delicious and doesn ' t have that weird protein taste some powders have . It ' s amazing , even if it clumps a little when I don ' t use the blender and mix it with milk .

My husband and I travel for several weeks a year in an RV , and always take " instant " and " single cup " brews along with us . I have taken both Maxwell House and Folgers " brew in the cup " coffee bags , and found them acceptable ( in lieu of a fresh cup of coffee from an actual coffee pot ) , so my expectations were that this coffee would be similar in taste and quality . I was wrong . I thought this was an exceptionally tasty cup of coffee - on par with coffee that has been brewed in a coffee maker . It is smooth and flavorful , with a very fresh taste .

I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs .

My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender . Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the " sludge " ( from the brown rice ) with cold water .

Other than pricing for the coffee which is all over the map ( anywhere from $ . 40 per cup to $ . 75 ) the coffee itself is excellent . .

I really like tacos and Spanish rice . Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack , it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium . The last time I bought a box of Spanish rice , I tossed the seasoning pack and added a couple of tablespoons of this instead . It was just as good and the only salt came from the canned tomatoes .

I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty . If you use the recommended 8oz setting , it has a full enough flavor . My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener .

If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time . I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description .

I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything . My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat , hand pressing the liquids , then boil the water out .

To start with , I ' m not a big fan of hot tea . I like iced tea , but I prefer to drink coffee if I ' m having a hot beverage . That said , I was pleasantly surprised with this tea . It has a good , smooth taste to it . To me , the taste is not overwhelming or bitter , and it is smooth and strong enough that I didn ' t feel compelled to add any sweetener . I would fail miserably if I tried to describe the taste to anyone else , but I can say that I quite enjoy it and will probably pick up some more now that the weather is starting to cool off .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors . I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'negative']]
I had these cookies in Germany , but I had a hard time finding them in the US . I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon . They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies , but they ' re a little richer and a little moister . I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12 , but I already knew I liked them , so ordering 12 wasn ' t really a problem . A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I would recommend trying this flavor and this product in the store before buying . The planks are chewy enough that they taste kind of stale just as a granola bar or snack by themselves . I suppose if you were hiking and really hungry they might taste better , but I bought them for a snack when I work the midnight shift at work . They are acceptable with milk or yogurt , but I could just as easily buy regular granola and not have to break it up ( they don ' t break easily ) . I wouldn ' t buy this again .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'negative']]
When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts ! It is really wonderful and my go - to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve ( sometimes several as I give them away ) .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
If you follow correct method of preparing ( let this tea in boiling water for 10 - 15 minutes ) this will taste great .

I ' m a fan of all kinds of teas so it ' s easy to give them a thumbs up .

My cats do enjoy this food but the can is SO hard to open . The flip tab thing is easy to pry up but it hurts my fingers to use the flip tab to actually pull the top off the can .

I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon , but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently . My husband grabbed this for our baby ( 7 months old ) and I thought , oh great - this is going to suck . Well , it didn ' t - the baby gobbled this up the first time and every time we feed him this flavor . Even though I try to do all organic , this is one I happily make an exception for because he loves it so much .

I can ' t speak to the authenticity of the spice mix as I don ' t have any prior experience with it , but I used this in an Ethiopian chicken lentil stew recipe I got on Eating Well and it was delicious and pleasantly warming .

I ' m a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the " bold " flavors . The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second . I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor . Its a nice balance . I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

I ' ve tried these before individually , but this was the first opportunity I had to get them together . First , the food is relatively good quality for this kind of product , but I would say that it ' s more oily than what you ' d find in a restaurant ( and definitely moreso than homecooked ) and of course significantly higher in sodium . The taste , however , is reasonably good . Second , the price that I paid for these was very good ( I ended up getting a 20 % discount ) , and so from a value perspective I would say decently good food + good price = very good value .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies . If you ' re going to give your child cookies , these are not so bad healthwise . However , the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving , when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each .

It smelled fantastic , but used in slightly larger amounts ( on popcorn , for example )  the off - flavoring was much more apparent . It tastes okay if you are only using it a couple drops at a time , but as a hardcore truffle lover , it just wasn ' t enough .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
I love these chips . The flavor is not plain . They are sweet and spicy all at the same time . The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt . But , it still a great flavor !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff ! I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him . It ' s chunky and you can see peas , carrots , potato , and , of course , the chunks of meat . I highly recommend this product !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
This is a hearty , healthy and tasty chili . I eat it alone or use it as a topping for vegetarian hot dogs or burgers . It ' s labeled medium - hot but I found it to be a little spicier than expected ; not to worry though , I toned it down by adding a tsp of lite sour cream - yum ! I think you ' ll enjoy this product . The flavor is so good that you really don ' t miss the salt .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Really easy to prepare and very yummy . With my microwave I put them in for 1 : 40 and they turn out perfect . Warm , crunchy and tasty . And without the carbs , they don ' t impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
My boys love this mix for breakfast . I love it because all you do is mix with water , so you can mix as little or as much as you need . They cook up light and fluffy . This is an easy hot breakfast before school . Amazon is the only place I can find this mix now I used to be able to purchase it local ) .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]
If you like coconut water . you ' ll love the chocolate . Zico tastes better to me than other brands . The chocolate is my favorite over all the Zico flavors .

This product is ridiculous in its claim . more shredded paper than good food product , basket is caved in , and shipping costs more than basket or food begins to be worth .

I first purchased these at Costco but since I don ' t always see them there , I jumped at the chance to order them when I saw them on Amazon . If you ' re not a big dark chocolate fan , I still recommend them because the chocolate is pretty mellow , not bitter like some dark chocolates . I love the taste of these and I almost feel like the calories are canceled out because of all the good things acai , blueberries , and dark chocolate do for you ! I ' ll be buying more !####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication . I am not sure it helps him that much at all , but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it . Which is good , because my insomnia was driving me absolutely nuts ! I have to get more 100 % cranberry juice , because I prefer this mixed in with juice than I do with water .####[['food general', 'positive']]
I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing ! So thick and creamy , especially if you make it with a little milk ! What I really like is that they aren ' t overly sweet , and that it mixed together very well , unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon . Definitely my favorite hot chocolate ! The cider flavors are great too !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers . I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot . This was a dissapointment . Nearly half the kernels never pop and the kernels that do pop are very small . I ' ll try buying other kernels but I would not buy this again .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

I was truly disappointed . If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this . There is nothing Chai about this product . Now I find out that this product is not eligible for return . So I am stuck with 3 bags of hot chocolate . This makes it hard for me to order other new items from Amazon don ' t want to waste anymore of my money .####[['food general', 'negative']]
I have three cats , and was having trouble finding a dry cat food that all three would eat in between canned food feedings , so I decided to give this one a try . They all three love this food , and it is pretty nutritious for them , and no animal by - products . I ' ve tried the Salmon flavor to  they don ' t seem to like it as well as this flavor , but all three eat it . Overall , this is a great food that most cats will like .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'neutral']]
I bought two boxes to get me thru the winter . It ' s just me drinking it as it ' s too rich for my wife to drink rathers Nestle crap lol ) .

This is really good stuff . They taste really good and are satisfying snacks . They ' re also pretty sweet , so its a nice way to soothe your sweet tooth .

If you love coconut , then this is for you . As a bona fide coco - ' nut ' , I can tell you this product is delicious . crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes . The drawbacks are that the bag contains a pretty small amount and the pieces are brittle and break . That being said , the coconut is great for snacking or garnishing desserts / baked goods .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid . I thought it was just ok . A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me . It ' s pretty much the same as Coffee People ' s Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call I can ' t tell the three apart . Interestingly , their Donut Shop is fantastic - - if you like Coffee People ( and you can ' t beat the prices here on Amazon ) , I ' d go for that one .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]
Recieved the package on time , but there was a glitch with the order . I hadn ' t recieved the cat food I had ordered . I called , and they immediately corrected the problem . . . crediting my account , and sending a complimentary bag of cat food for my inconvenience . It ' s rare to do business with a company with such stellar customer service . I would recommend them highly to anyone .####[['shipment delivery', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I love hot tea , but I have found that there are some brands and styles that I enjoy much more than others . My personal preference is a strong tea with a lot of character . This is that tea !

It ' s good , really good !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

We sent this selection of Six Mackinac " Fudge Slices " to my daughter ' s college dorm as a bit of comfort food at the start of the new semester . My daughter reports that all of the flavors are indeed " yummy " and they were very much appreciated by her roommates as well . The shipping from Mackinac was exceptionally fast with the fudge arriving well ahead of the estimated delivery date . Highly Recommended !

I bought this product , remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage . To my surprise , the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet . Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup , and the difference is obvious . Ferrara : sugar , water , almond extract , citric acid , artificial color , 1 / 10th of 1 % sodium benzoate ( as preservative ) Monin : Pure cane sugar , water , natural almond flavorI rest my case .####[['food quality', 'negative']]

Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label . The dosage amount of Glucosamine / Chondroitin is vague . It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine . Too expensive for me . The dogs love them , so if you want to give them an expensive treat they ' ll love , go for it . If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere .####[['food prices', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I have been enjoying this green tea immensely - being an avid green tea drinker and knowing there had to be more to green tea than the ' bag ' I researched it and found matcha .

These dried chicken breasts are a healthy treat . They are expensive so my dogs each get 2 a day .

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them . She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis . Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things . Since I am allergic to almost all medications , I have to find holistic ways to stay healthy . The tart cherry juice helps not only with arthritis but other things too . My body feels so much better when I use it every day .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I love having something in my desk that I can just dig into at lunch without even having to go stand in line for the microwave in the breakroom . But finding something really satisfying and tasty , and for under $ 3 , is amazing ! I ' ve always loved Bumblee Bee tuna anyway , and their tuna salad mix is fantastic .

I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor . The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container , just paper . However , the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod , consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect . Alas , we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore .####[['food general', 'positive']]

We really liked this licorice when it was sold in the store . It was the same exact brand , but a different container . We ordered some online when the store didn ' t carry it anymore .

My only complaint about this product is that I couldn ' t get it in the 4 oz cups like some of the other fruits . I love Mandarin Oranges and the price on these is good - - this is one that would help me if it was in cups because I tend to eat too much of these sweet , juicy morsels !

This has been our favorite chili for years , and we ' ve tried many . We ' ve even thrown away a partial case of another brand bought at a big box store . We use it for chili dogs , in heated corn tortillas with cheese , or in a bowl with diced onions on top . The only kind we like better is my homemade chili , which isn ' t always conveniently sitting on a shelf , waiting to be heated for a quick meal . We always take a few cans when we go camping , and are never without Hormel Chili in our pantry .####[['food general', 'positive']]
After not being able to find this product in large quantity , I found it at Amazon . com . Truthfully , I much prefer these over what you find in the stores .

This has a LOT of sugar in it . How about about matching the label with the product ? This is not " rich espresso mellowed by a touch of cream " .

Espresso + cream is what I want , and this product doesn ' t fit the bill .####[['food quality', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
I used to get these candies every day back in high school . Our German teacher would have them for sale . I bought a box from Amazon and was transported back to those days .

The bag was smaller than I expected , but that ' s probably just me being bad at estimating things . The salt seems good , however , I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are . I mean , they are pink , just not so bright pink as it shows . The salt has a good flavor though . I ' d say it was worth the price .####[['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]
