My 14 month old loves these pouches and it ' s a great way of getting broccoli into her diet . she just started being able to do it herself recently , although it ' s sometimes messy . I just wish they were available in the larger size . 3 . 5 ounces is not a lot for a toddler - she can finish this in a minute and would want more . She also loves the spinach , mango , and pear happy baby pouches which are bigger .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]

This is good mustard , it is hot so you have to be careful with it .

Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father ' s lead ) , I ' ve never been an avid hot tea drinker . I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea . Healthy or not , this tea is delicious . I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar .

I originally started buying Zevia a year ago for my diabetic mother - we actually did some glucose testing just after drinking a can and our glucose levels did not change so that was good to know .

For a regular cup of coffee , I like the smooth taste of Donut House Extra Bold or Green Mountain Breakfast blend . I did not like this one at all - - I guess it just depends on your taste . I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn ' t like it . It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it . This one ' s for you if you like a more bitter / bittersweet coffee - - it just didn ' t appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it . It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup when feeling sluggish .

I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola .

It ' s pretty sub - par granola . These are ok snacks but I like other granola bars better .####[['food general', 'neutral'], ['food quality', 'negative']]

Sardines sometimes have a bad reputation because the cheaper ones are smelly and covered in tomato sauce or mustard . Crown Prince sardines are neither smelly nor " fishy " tasting , and because they are skinless and boneless , can be eaten on crackers , for example , and have the delicate flavor of a well - prepared salmon or tuna . They furnish a high protein content as well as potassium , and are a good source of Omega - 3 .

If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do , you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper , albeit beautiful , since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna .

We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight . The ingredients seemed great , but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5 - 7 times per day ! The food did little to help with weight reduction ( even with all the vomiting ) , and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian - prescribed food instead . Note : Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem . ) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food , his stool has become firmer and less frequent , and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis . As I stated above , the ingredients seemed very healthy and nutritious , but I would not feed this to my dog or recommend it to anyone else .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2 - 3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

Do you remember the Rolos of several years ago ? The Rolos with chewy caramel in the center ? Well , that ' s all changed now . Whatever is in the center is neither chewy , nor caramel as you and I know it . These are not your mother ' s Rolos .####[['food quality', 'negative']]
My three very finicky dogs love this product , and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training . There is only one ingredient in this : liver , all sourced within the United States , so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs . I buy this on a regular basis . It ' s priced better than any pet supply store I ' ve seen , even the larger chains . Qualifies for free shipping , which is also nice .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['shipment prices', 'positive']]
If this were just a good tasting , better for you than the sugar and caffeine bombs little drink , it would be great . The problem with it is the mystical IQ enhancing promise . Basically , you drink it , it tastes good , it ' s crisp and not too sweet , but you don ' t suddenly get smarter or feel the need to do calculus for giggles . It ' s a nice drink trapped in herbal hype , and hence a hyped price . Fail .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'conflict'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
I was rather disappointed . This sounded so wonderful in theory . In practice it was okay . Not great , not horrible just okay . Definitely not up to any hype .####[['food general', 'conflict']]
I support a local animal shelter , too which I provide food monthly . By ordering in bulk , not only do I save money but it helps my budget in contributing to saving animals lives . The food is always shipped and delivered professionally and on time . I have tried buying in bulk at discount stores , but my time and gas factored in does not make it as cost effective as having it delivered to my home . Would highly recommend .####[['shipment delivery', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned . We didn ' t know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life . We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout . We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well . Definitely a great find .####[['food general', 'positive']]

Our son only eats hot dogs some thought we would try making some . We used a frankfurter recipe and ground chicken . These casings , while gross , are easy to untangle , clean , and feed onto the machine . After cooking they tasted delicious and didn ' t get gummy or gross like the gelatin type . If you can get past what they are ( pig intestines ) they really work well ! Would recommend a smaller size for hot dogs .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
These are great for making larger portions of baby food . I think I ' ll use them more as my baby gets older . For my 7 - month - old , one cube makes about 2 - 3 servings of food for her . I love that it has a cover , and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out . But , it ' s pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food , and the fewer slots make it harder to mass - produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
I originally purchased this for my kids but they wouldn ' t drink it . They don ' t know what they ' re missing because this stuff is great .

Seriously , this stuff actually looks like something humans could eat . When you open the can , it looks and smells like real ( canned ) food , not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse , meat paste . Gluten - free , which has helped reduce the amount of cat barf left in random places or hidden behind couches , etc . We buy two or three varieties at a time and rotate it through so the cats don ' t get bored with it . Pricey , but definitely worth it !####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'conflict']]

Fabulous product ! It is just like the Hurricane popcorn we while we lived in Hawaii . It has just the right amount of butter , mochi crunch , and nori .

I will definitely order again .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'negative']]
Have used the sugar - free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now . Just got this 3 - pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different ; and not in a good way if you liked the original . The new product is quite ' artificial ' tasting . Called Torani ' s and was told that ' yes ' the formula had been changed and there had been so many complaints that they will soon be releasing the original flavor again ( which has a richer , more mellow taste ) but under the name ' Classic Hazelnut ' . We will order again when it comes out . . .####[['food quality', 'conflict'], ['food general', 'conflict']]

This is a wonderful flavored coffee , but as another reviewer pointed out The New Mall is vastly over priced .

These have just the right amount of flavor & aroma . Although they could use more rosemary if you ask me . I would love to eat the whole box in one sitting but my sore mouth would stop that .

So beware tender mouths .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'conflict'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
I love the citrus and the raspberry flavors of the Ricochet Sours . They are shaped like Smarties candies , but are a bit more crumbly . I love sweet and tart , and these certainly fit the bill .

I tried Vitamin Squeeze this morning as an alternative to my usual caffeinated and carbonated morning beverage . It has a nice fruit punch flavor , and very little after taste . I followed the directions of one squirt per eight ounces of water , and was rewarded with a light flavor that was not overpowering . I imagine that you could increase your squirts if you wanted more fruity goodness , but one squirt seemed about right for me . Vitamin Squeeze was a good eye opener for the morning , and it made me feel good to know I was getting all of those vitamins ! This is a nice product that is easy to use and is one that I will be purchasing in the future .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me . Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest , but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind . Maybe it was the milk , but I have tried these on their own too and find that they ' re kind of short on flavor .

Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors . They are addictive , and it ' s hard to imagine eating popcorn without them . One problem is that they don ' t do well in humidity , turning into a solid mass . That fact will make it hard to buy a six - pack from here . Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate - controlled house , you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf . If it cakes , we have found that you can open the bottom of the container , place the product in a blender and make it usable .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]

I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper . I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter , if your hot air popper has a lot of power , be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop . The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly , I do not find the popcorn fluffier or less " husky " . In fact , I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write ! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper . It is nice to know the corn is organic , but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply ! ; )####[['food style_options', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food general', 'conflict']]

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good .

When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit , so I bought another box . The second box , not so much . I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me . The tea does not have a bad taste , doable for its purpose . Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes , vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer .

I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made . If it is made in China , I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food , cat food , jewelry , tooth paste , baby formula , and more . I avoid anything made in China as China manufacturers only care about profits . They have no regard at all for people as long as they make money . I suspect this may be garbage made in China because the price is awfully low , which is a tell - tale sign it was made in China .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

Some people say it ' s gross because it is instant coffee and uses hydrogenated oil but it ' s super great - - plus you ' re saving money on cream and sugar ! Also , I agree with the person who said it tasted like gas station coffee , but we must have different gas stations because everybody ( myself include ) loves the cappucinos at my gas station !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food prices', 'positive']]

I ' ve never given a poor review before but these olives are so awful I can ' t find one good thing to say about them . I love spicy and bold foods , but the spice here is overwhelming and has such an unpleasant flavor ! I have been soaking them for the past 2 days in cold water in the hopes of salvaging them , all to no avail . The unpleasant flavor is still there full force . doubt I will be able to save them at this point but will keep trying .####[['food general', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative']]
This is a great company because when you go to the grocery store spices are so expensive and this company is much cheaper and fresher . I will only buy my spices from them from now on . I still can ' t believe how much you get for the price I though it was going to be one of those too good to be true things but I was wrong . I ' ve already told 3 friends who were very happy with their purchases too .####[['amazon prices', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
I simply love this dressing . My salads are always the talk of the party - - everyone wants to know what type of dressing I used !

I was very excited to find a cheaper cider . However , it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand . Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened . When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway .

I have another pumpkin eating dog ( it really has helped her IBD ) and couldn ' t find canned locally . I ordered three cases of this ( error on my part but not worth undoing due to scarcity ) and awaited arrival with some trepidation thanks to negative feedback on damage to cans . To my very great delight , only 1 of the 36 cans had a even a small dent so looks like the problem has been solved , at least as far as my shipment goes . Can ' t comment on product itself beyond saying that it really is helping the dog .####[['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['shipment delivery', 'negative'], ['shipment quality', 'neutral'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect . The dough was much wetter than regular bread ( more like a thick batter ) , and at first I thought I must have made a mistake when I measured the other ingredients . Then I found out that gluten - free bread has a much different dough than wheat flour bread . The bread baked perfectly and tasted great . it had a different texture than regular bread , but was still very tasty .####[['food style_options', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums , I was hoping they would be nice . But they taste pretty artificial , and the texture has no chew to it . Fine if you like that sort of thing , but I was disappointed . They are slightly redeemable if you let them sit open for a couple weeks , so I gave two stars . Still , I ' ll never buy them again ; I ' ll stick to gummy bears and wine gums for my rare candy indulgences .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli , and it turned out quite good . Noodle strands were separate ( not mushy ) and taste wasn ' t any different from regular rice vermicelli . My wife mentioned that if the vermicelli was cooked exactly as instructed on the package , noodles would come out too dry and hard . She said sha had to add some ( about half a cup ) more water during the preparation of the dish . That made the noodles soft enough , but still not mushy . I recommend this product considering the health benefit of brown rice and the taste .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
Zuke ' s is a great natural mini treat . They are the perfect size for training . Since they are a soft treat , you can easily break them into smaller pieces if you want .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added . Was quite disappointed to learn that 12 egg whites are also needed . This results in a lot of egg yolks which need to be used in another recipe or pitched . If that many eggs are needed , I might as well make the cake from scratch . No need for a mix . As a side note , the cake mix did perform well and produce a good angel food cake .####[['food general', 'conflict'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
Just read the title , seriously . I am a tea junkie and love my Chai . After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods . I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas . If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do . For me , one tea bag makes a quart of good tea !####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]
I ' m in a dinner club with some friends once a month . When I was the hostest I had a spa themed dinner with a raspberry & rose petal punch .

I have tried several different brands of mixers . This is my favorite . I buy it by the case , often giving bottles away to friends who also enjoy the taste .

As you can see from the title , that it is is a must . I just add it to all savory dishes . It adds a depth . It is not available in supermarkets .

I ' ve been very surprised how much I enjoyed the combination of mint and green tea . This tea is a very nice balance between mellow mint flavor and mellow green tea flavor .

Great cereal that for some reason is unavailable in any grocery stores in our area ! Kelloggs has not been helpful when I question them about why ! So I was very excited when I found it on Amazon !

Thanks !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['shipment prices', 'positive']]
I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts . These are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful . The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans . There are barely any pecans , but tons of cashews . Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there .####[['food recommendation', 'negative'], ['food quality', 'negative'], ['food style_options', 'negative']]
Sometimes more is NOT better . In this instance , however , double the bergamot IS FAR superior to regular Earl Grey tea . Stash found a good balance and actually improved on what a basically good thing ( Earl Grey tea ) . If you have not tried this I highly recommend it . You will never look at tea the same again .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]
My picky friends and I all agree that this is close to the ultimate in chocolate . BUT . . . . . . at the current ( 9 April 2010 ) tarriff of $ 7 . 99 for ONE BAR ( plus shipping on orders uder $ 25 ) , we ' ll continue buying it at local supermarkets ( and even at the store everyone loves to hate ) for $ 2 . 18 or a bit more ; sometimes less on sale . Amazon , I ADORE you - - you often have excellent prices , your web site is the best , and nothing has ever gone awry with anything from you , so I buy lots of food here in addition to DVDs , CDs , techie toys , clothes , garden & kitchen stuff , and , yes , books , but surely you can find a more reasonably - priced source !####[['amazon prices', 'conflict'], ['shipment prices', 'negative'], ['food general', 'positive']]
David Rio Flamingo Sugar Free Chai Tea Latte is so delicious and creamy , all you need to do is add water . No milk is needed ! It tastes just as you imagine a creamy vanilla chai latte should . . .

I just pray that David Rio comes out with a sugar free version of the chocolate chai . . .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['food general', 'positive']]

I am a regular subscriber of this " Jack Link ' s " beef jerky terriyaki . This morning , I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10 . I used to trust Amazon and this is the first time that I check the quantity in the box . Since the inside box is open , so someone might have taken one during the packing process because s / he loves it so much but I hate to lose one bag of my Jack Links beef jerky ! !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]
These bars are great ! I like so many of the different flavors . It is hard to find a soy - free and dairy - free bar with some protein , so it was great to find these .

Give these a try , you won ' t be disappointed .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon availability', 'positive'], ['food recommendation', 'positive']]

These SmartFries are so awsome ! With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving , but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories . I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20 . If any of you love the Trader Joe ' s Skinny Fries , then you ' re in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs .

With so many Green Tea powders on Amazon , I mostly rely on the customer comments . This tea is exactly what I was looking for and the price was reasonable compared to others .

We will buy again !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'positive']]
Dude , they ' re Reese ' s Cups . If you need to read a review that probably means you ' ve never had one .

I bought this because it was on sale and hey we ' re in a recession , right ? I thought it was too sweet . Maybe it is my adult tastebuds . Tastes a lot like good ol ' cinnamon toast crunch .

I have sampled many bulk Chai teas and I have to say this is the BEST one ever . It is very authentic and hits a lot of flavor notes . Perfectly balanced spices with a hint of heat from black pepper . Keep in mind it is a process to brew , so give yourself about 10 + minutes from start to finish . Use 1 3 / 4 teaspoons per serving and sweeten with honey to enhance the flavors .####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive']]
We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food . Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we ' ve had them on . It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for ! When Amazon upped the price $ 10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals , but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen , but that awful smelling gas came back as well ! ! We are putting them back on Canidae . It ' s worth it ! !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['amazon prices', 'conflict']]
This is good coffee . I think it is just short of 5 - start rating . The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast . Bold coffee drinkers could probably make it stronger and enjoy a bold taste due to the fine grinding . I don ' t think any coffee drinkers will be displeased with this roast . We made a pot for a dinner party and everyone gave it the thumbs up !####[['food general', 'positive'], ['food quality', 'positive'], ['food style_options', 'positive']]

I eat a teaspoon of coconut oil at night to maintain regularity . I ' ve also found that certain foods taste better when cooking in coconut oil . I ' ve tried several brands , but the Nutiva brands tastes best to me . I dinged this review one star because these jars are made of plastic rather than glass . If they shipped in glass jars Nutiva coconut oil would be a perfect product .####[['food quality', 'positive'], ['shipment quality', 'negative']]
I always make sure I ' m stocked with these bones to occupy my dog for at least 30 - 60 minutes at a time . He chews the same bone for 2 or 3 days . He satisfies his chewing instinct and stays away from my boyfriend ' s shoes .
