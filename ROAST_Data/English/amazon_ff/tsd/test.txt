I grabbed a variety of various protein / energy bars , including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt . The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides . The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing , unfortunately . Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful , but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one . They just don ' t make sense on my pallet .####[['KIND bars', 'positive'], ['KIND bars', 'negative']]
My dog has had some skin issues ( about a month after we adopted him we found out that he has mange ) , and his coat wasn ' t looking very nice . After getting him some medicine and switching his food to Natural Choice he looks like a new dog . His fur is soft , smooth and shiny now as opposed to how coarse and dull it used to be . He is kind of picky about his food as well , and he really loves this . Great product !####[['Natural Choice', 'positive']]
These will be the death of me , now that I can have my cookies and eat them too . They taste great , I use plenty of coconut oil to make mine . Buying it here in bulk is a mch better deal than getting it in the stores . I keep the ratio of ingredient the same , and cooking time / temp is just right too . Perfect amount of chocolate chips . I hope they make more gluten free desserts !####[['cookies', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Our picky JRT positively loves this food . I purchased two flavors to try the brand and I ' m back to try some others . When I opened the cans for the first time , it looked good enough to serve humans . The texture and smell does not make you think dog food .

I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate . I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn ' t find it for some time . But happily it became available again and I ordered enough to last a while . I like the way it tastes and love the fact that it is like 30 calories per serving . The low calorie count gives me more reasons to keep using it .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['hot chocolate', 'positive']]
I tried this oatmeal because all of the other oatmeals on the market tasted funny when I came back from a trip to England . This reminds me of what I ate in England .

McCanns is a good product and I was glad that I found it here .####[['McCanns', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]

Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love . I chose this brand for its natural ingredients . Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity .

Although I have enjoy the Silver Needle Tea from this company immensely I was very disappointed with this tea . I have ordered this from other companies and loved it The green tea they use in this is not as good and how the rice is toasted is just not the same . If you want to try it don ' t make the mistake I did and order the 16 - Ounce bag . package is easy to open . that is probably the best thing about these cookies . they taste more like wafers than cookies . the cookie is too thin and the p - nut butter flavor is too weak for my taste . i expected more from oreo .####[['tea', 'negative']]
I would , by no means , consider myself a green tea expert , but , I definitely appreciate its place in my life , and as part of my morning breakfast ritual . I find that I feel the antioxidants percolate in my head . What ' s more , I actually am one of those weird people who like how bitter it tastes , when you ' ve brewed it to its full potential . Stash Premium Green Tea does not fail to disappoint , in the antioxidant factor . What ' s more , there is a wonderful smoky quality , too . Stash has always produced a high quality line of teas , and this is another wonderful addition to their family of flavors and adventures in hot water .####[['Stash Premium Green Tea', 'negative'], ['Stash Premium Green Tea', 'positive']]
Decided to look up this oil after hearing some great things about it in the 4 Hour Body book . I made the purchase online as Macadamia nut oil is not the easiest to find in the local grocery store .

The three bottles came packed well and I ' ll be ordering again once I ' m finished .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['Macadamia nut oil', 'positive']]
I really love their other products but this one just isn ' t a winner . I tried every combination possible ( microwave , hot water , hot milk ) hoping that the favor would change , especially since I bought 8 boxes of the stuff . But no luck ! I can ' t seeing throwing the stuff away so I will donate it and hope that it bring someon ' s taste buds alive . i have enjoyed this product for quite some time . however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on . shame on nana and amazon . . .####[['cookie bars', 'negative'], ['cookie bars', 'neutral'], ['amazon', 'negative']]
I dislike it when they lump reviews for all flavors together . I have to rate these 5 stars because most flavors are amazing . I love popchips .

I was unsure on weather or not to try this product boy I am I glad that I did . I added chicken and stewed tomatoes for my first try the 6 suggested servings went to 3 second helping and the picky kids scraping the bowls asking for more .

If your not big into spicy food only add half the seasoning packet but the other half is great to add to chili of beef stew even spaghetti sauce .####[['NULL', 'positive']]
Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn ! They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag . 3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag .

I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe . Whenever I put it out at feeding time , there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot ' s Stew in them . With 5 kitty mouths to feed , the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot ' s Stew , so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied . Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting , those poor things that had to " settle " for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew . I have been so pleased with it , that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners . But , at our house , WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines !####[["Spot ' s Stew", 'positive']]

If my dog likes something , he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn ' t , he ' ll give it a sniff and walk away . He really liked Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food . The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed , which seems unnecessary . The first ingredient is beef , but there are a lot of filler ingredients as well , including " animal digest " and " poultry by - product meal " . Google those terms if you want grossed out . It ' s probably a decent dog food for the price , but if I continue to feed it to my dog , I will supplement with fresh meats , fruits and vegetables .####[["Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food", 'positive'], ["Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food", 'negative']]

As new Keurig users , we wanted to try a lot of different types of drinks before we bought any full packs . This is a great way to do just that . We got 35 cups and one 1 repeat .

I didn ' t look carefully at the ingredient list before I ordered these treats . They contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so I ended up sending them back . They are a hard , crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity .

Oatmeal Squares is in about the largest print you can fit on the Box . When you read the ingredients , the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour .

This is an excellent , cost - effective alternative to Red Bull . The flavor is spot on - - even though a purist may be able to notice the difference , I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal !

And knowing that it ' s turkey , you know you ' re eating a fairly healthy snack , too . Love this stuff , I ' m hooked !####[['jerky', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
These are very good tasting and when I gave a few to my baby he loved them ! But after looking at the back and seeing that the second ingredient is sugar I decided this probably isn ' t the kind of thing I want my baby to get used to . I don ' t want him to get used to sugary snack foods at such a young age , I ' m sure there will be enough of that when he ' s older . I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar , I would buy it than .####[['yogurt snack', 'positive'], ['yogurt snack', 'negative']]

I ' m hopeless in the kitchen , but I LOVE homemade whole - grain bread , so it was a happy day when I found Saf Instant Yeast . Anything more complicated than " add exactly these measurements , mix , put in pan , bake " has always terrified me . So now with some good no - knead recipes even a kitchen disaster like myself can bake bread that ' s super quick , healthy , and tasty , and also way cheaper than that spongy crap you get at the supermarket . This is by far the best price I ' ve found on this yeast as well .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['Saf Instant Yeast', 'positive']]

I ordered these chocolates for my girlfriend a few weeks ago . The only problem I had was that Amazon said it would take 3 - 5 days to deliver , which was great because I could receive the chocolates and give them to my girlfriend and surprise her , but they delivered them the very next day . Other than that , great product . Beautiful packaging and great taste . I would recommend these for sure but be aware of the shipping time and expect them faster than 3 - 5 business days .####[['shipping', 'positive'], ['chocolates', 'positive']]

Buying K - Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have . People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup - count . The trick is to comparison shop the price per - Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes . eight more cups makes a difference . This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes , and it is shipped to your door .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['shipped', 'positive']]
This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe . it ' s artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it .

I love eating these chips . They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa ' s butt when he walked by . Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger ' s rear , and it brings back memories . Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma .

The astronaut ice cream was broken up into not - too - small bite size chunks , melts in your mouth , and was fresh and delicious ! The expiration date was about 2 yrs ahead . At 120 calories and 6g of fat , this treat is pretty good for the calorie - conscious too ( ? ) Another reviewer commented that there were slits in the inner paper packaging and threw out the product - the slits are to facilitate the freeze drying process as mentioned on the wrapper .

This is the best Blueberry tea that I have ever had . I use 2 bags of blueberry plus 1 bag of green tea for a 16 oz cup of iced tea .

This may sound rediculous , but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle - brand jalapeno chips . At the time I placed my order , I couldn ' t remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked , and the Kettle - brand chips were packaged in a similarly - colored bag . But , it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle - brand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games . When I run out ( probably sometime next year ! ) , I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle - brand chips . Imho , Kettle - brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip ' affection - ados ' . Sincerely , § homiedog § old version of this product with the packaging shown in the picture was good . the new brown crosshatch pattern package ( 3 oz bags ) version is no good . seems they sold out and went for cheaper beef and / or processing . really bummed out .####[['Kettle - brand jalapeno chips', 'positive']]
I have had my 3 cats on Science Diet indoor cat , and noticed that their coat was feeling a bit ratty . I switched to this for the higher protein and fat content , and within about 2 months , their coats seem glossier . I can ' t say anything about if they shed less , but the quality of the coat feels better . Warning - because of the higher fat and protein content , you only feed about half as much food as you would on a normal diet . For example , my 3 cats got 2 cups of the science diet total a day , and now they get 1 cup a day of the professional to maintain the same weight all my guys are a good weight ) .####[['NULL', 'positive']]

Brilliant way to indulge in the flavor of chocolate without having to think about sugar or gluten or anything else you might be trying to avoid . Last year I drank this yummy organic tea while on a detox plan and it was very satisfying and felt decadent .

These gluten free cheese bites come in a convenient little bag that you can just grab and slip into your purse when on the go . The cheese bites are shaped like cute little squares or triangles .

After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it , I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come . Unfortunately for me , the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly . But I stuck with it , started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production . While I ' m sure it works for some , if you ' re just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with I don ' t think taking this will increase your supply much if at all . But if you think you ' d like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you !####[['pills', 'negative'], ['pills', 'positive']]
. . but the product photo threw me off a little . For some reason I was thinking the 3 pounds were being shipped in ( 6 ) 1 / 2 pound bags . Anyway , totally an assumption and goof - up on my part . I ' m leaning towards using all liquid malt extract going forward though . I can get 6 pounds ( just the right amount for a 5 - 6 gallon batch ) shipped to my house for about $ 16 . The dry malt has extended shelf life , and has more malt per pound , but in terms of ease of use and economy the liquid malt seems like the way to go .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['malt', 'positive']]

This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !####[['matcha', 'positive'], ['matcha', 'neutral']]

The packaging is great for a gift . The teabags are pyramidal in shape . As far as taste , if you ' re just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla , then this Tazo brand will do it for you .

Unfortunately , I am stuck with 480 mints that I do not like because you cannot return these kind of items to Amazon ( which makes sense , I guess ) . Anyway , when you first put the mint in your mouth there is no taste . Zero . Then , as the mint gets crumbly - - not in a slow dissolve way but just a fall apart way - - you get a little mint .

There is nothing bad about the product itself , but the beans do not taste like chocolate even though I had dared to dream .

In researching dandelion root , I came across a lot of different , sometimes contradictory claims , none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research . I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect , and it is supposedly good for the liver . Again , those claims may be dubious , but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason ( caffeine , acid ) . It tasted terrible to me at first , but after about 4 cups I really started to like it . I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes . Now it basically tastes like coffee to me ( note that I ' m more of a tea drinker , however ) .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]

Why so great ! It has a lot less sugar than the american version and the beans hold their shape after the processing system . A lot less mushy than the american vegetarian version .

Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies , some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags . The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent / normal size but they really are a bit smaller . Case they are shipped in is great for storage , in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase . Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though . . . unless you like dark , crumby hard ones .####[['cookies', 'negative'], ['shipped', 'negative'], ['shipped', 'positive']]
This is our 4th time ordering the Navitas Organic Raw Cacao Nibs and we ' ve been very happy with every purchase . We love to grind and blend them as you would coffee in a french press . The flavor is wonderful and the natural energy burst from the theobromine keeps my husband alert while working nights , without the shaky caffeine withdrawals common with coffee drinks . We highly recommend this to anyone for the exceptional flavor and quality .####[['Navitas Organic Raw Cacao Nibs', 'positive']]
I went to my local farmer ' s market recently and they had an amazing peach creme brulee . I wanted to learn how to make it with peach flavoring but obviously wasn ' t going to use chunks of peaches to flavor it . I saw this product and figured I ' d give it a go . To my surprise , it turned out to be a perfect flavoring for my creme brulee . I only used a teaspoon ( it is very strong ) .####[['peach', 'positive']]
This gift was a big hit . It has a cool look to the product as well as the actual tea . The shipping box arrived in a little bit of a beaten up state , but the glass pot was packaged very well and was in perfect condition . The only two issues I had with this was the chest is pretty cheaply made and began to come apart as I spent almost a half and hour picking off the glue residue ( the second issue ) . If you know a tea lover , this is overall a pretty nice gift to give .####[['shipping', 'negative'], ['shipping', 'positive'], ['tea', 'positive']]
Flamin ' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites . The meat is tender , and the taste ( based on the ones I ' ve bought ) are extreme with flavor .

Adds a nice flavor to manhattans . Lots of flavor . I use Peychauds with other bitters in ice water for a great 0 calorie drink . Vary the amounts of each for a well rounded drink .

Decent , strong cup with overtones of Italian or French roasts . CP Organic Bold is a bit " rounder " and Jet Fuel is a tad bitter . Produces a nice cup of reasonably strong coffee that is not bitter or harsh .

With the bulk packaging and subscription , Coffee People produce the least expensive K cups we have found at around 35 cents per pod .####[["Timothy ' s blends", 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]

One of my kitties has ear allergies , so after much research I decided to put them on a grain free diet . I purchased a number of different types of can food from the pet store .

I use a ton of " greenies " or other dental products for my little dog ( a 7 lb Yorkie / Maltese mix . ) She used to hate it when I left the house , so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only . However , she was started to get a little chunky , so thought switching her to the " light " version might be a better option . I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system , but I ' ve seen no problem thus far , and I ' ve been using them for over a week . She doesn ' t seem to notice a difference at all , and I feel comfortable knowing I ' m not overfeeding her ( in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place ! ) I would definitely recommend this product .####[['regular greenies', 'positive']]
If you ' re looking for the tea served on ice with condensed milk or hot at your favorite Thai restaurant , this is it ! The package says to use 4 tablespoons of tea per cup and strain - so I bought this 4 - pack ( figuring that 4T per cup would use up the stuff pretty fast ) . I think that ratio is way too much . I use about 3 tablespoons in my 1 liter French press , and it comes out great . Just pour the water over the tea , stir a few times while letting it steep and serve . Enjoy ! - Charlie####[['tea', 'positive']]
I have to wait until I go home to visit my mom to buy this , or else drive 25 miles out of my way since no local stores carry this . So I usually buy at least 6 at a time to make sure I have enough to last . Makes excellent pasta salad dressing . Just the right amount of tang and no unpleasant after taste . The flavor sets really well with spinach and fruit salads . The regular is also just as good .####[['NULL', 'positive']]
Best granola on the market ! Would never guess it ' s gluten free . I order six bags at a time to make sure I never run out .

This product is excellent for making homemade soy hot cocoa mix ( a few family members are allergic to dairy ) - we have not used this on its own . This mix is not easy to find in local grocery stores and Amazon made it a breeze to order and ship . BTW , the hot cocoa mix turned out great ; make sure to use a good - quality baking cocoa ( like Guittard ) . We followed Alton Brown ' s recipe ( ) without the cayenne ( for the kids ) . On a cold , blustery day , no one gets left out on the fun when they get asked , " Who wants hot cocoa ? "####[['mix', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'positive']]
I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink . To my taste buds , this does not taste rich and chocolate - y despite its name of " Double Chocolate Meltdown " . But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose , it is the best hot chocolate powder around . I ' ve tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee . It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee , and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation . Love it for that !####[['hot chocolate drink', 'negative'], ['hot chocolate drink', 'positive']]
This peach raspberry instant oatmeal is excellent . It ' s pleasantly , not overwhelmingly , sweet . It has wonderful grains and textures .

This beef jerky is extremely salty . I tried the wood smoked flavor , and I figured people were just being a bit picky .

I like to try a lot of different coffee and have even roasted my own occasionally and this is by far one of the best if not THE best coffee I have had .

This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily - - good if you ' re into that .

I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint . It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars .

I watch for this 48 - pack of Oreos to drop below fifteen bucks to justify the convenience for the price .

Excellent product ! It does exactly what it claims to do . My only concern is that you can ' t continue to stir and cook once it begins to thicken or it will begin to thin out again .

I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned . We didn ' t know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life . We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout . We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well . Definitely a great find .####[['Canidae', 'positive']]

I searched far and wide for a peanut butter without added sugar and salt . This peanut butter is very slightly crunchy .

I ordered twice from this seller ; the products sold by this store are great ! The flavors and effectiveness of their products is through the roof . The item is a tasty treat for yourself during the day , with the sweetness of the chocolate along with the bitterness of the coffee bean is an amazing combination , and you will be nicely energized for the rest of the day . The sellers themselves are amazingly helpful and very quick to respond to any problems you may be having , I highly recommend this product from this seller . 10 / 10####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['product', 'positive']]
The flavor of CALM is great and the children love it too . Prefer liquid supplements and because of strenuous workouts , needed to take calcium magnesium supplements .

I bought this item because I wanted a treat that would last a little longer and keep my dogs attention . I use this treat with this toy as a special occasion treat and my dog loves it every time . My dog even likes the toy by itself and will gnaw on it for awhile . My only complaint is that he is able to bite off small ( pea - sized ) chunks from the white plastic bone . Once that happens , I find myself replacing the toy because you do not want to step on the toy by accident because the white part becomes very sharp . I am on my second replacement in two years .####[['treat', 'positive'], ['treat', 'negative']]

Thirteen bucks delivered when my local store doesn ' t carry this item is a plus . Many other online stores want over TWO dollars a pound + shipping .

Purchased this elsewhere but reviewing here . We did not like the flavor of this by itself - it tastes like plain tomato sauce . Has a nice , thick consistency .

100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers . This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes . The pods work well , as intended , and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity . The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use . I have since tried several of their different coffees , and yet this remains my favorite ! litly carbonated yet sweet not to sweet it does really taste like lime and it is a very good soda i love limes and 7up and ramune a japenese soda . if you like any of those u will love this stuff but dont buy it on amazon buy it at smith which sels them for 89 . c you have to use a bottle opener to open them enjoy####[['coffee', 'positive']]
The Amazon description is wrong . In the one I saw , the ingredients list was pretty simple , with no artificial sweeteners or " weird " additives .

My son is very picky . Once he saw these pouches in target and grabbed one and asked me to open it . he then devoured the entire pouch in less than 5 min . So i decided to buy him this from amazon . He enjoys one almost everyday for a snak . you know how when you bite into a nice piece of tasty fruit licorice ? that exquisite moment when the citrus hits the taste buds and you know that the soft chew soon to follow will release more flavor ? that ' s what you ' ll get with this pomegranate licorice ! thank heavens that Amazon only sent a small bag , ' cause there is no way a big stash would last very long in the casa ! this is some good stuff !####[['amazon', 'positive'], ['fruit licorice', 'positive']]
It ' s hard to explain what this Bonito del Norte tuna is like to people that can only relate to the canned tuna commonly found in grocery stores in America . It really is a completely different type of food . Delicate , tasteful , and healthy ! You are probably used to mixing your tuna with mayonnaise or some other thing to make it palatable , but it would be a shame to do that with this tuna , because it is truly a pleasure to eat on its own on crispy french bread . I will keep ordering this product and make it a regular part of my diet .####[['Bonito del Norte tuna', 'positive']]
So Fall is the time for all the cliches we see advertising autumn leaves , Halloween , Thanksgiving , and pumpkins everywhere . How appropriate a time to try this new blend . and I must say , I love the flavor of pumpkin , so I was genuinely looking forward to this . Be warned , it does say pumpkin spice Latte , so when the cup produces a foam , it was designed to do that . Flavor is good , not great , but it is creamy , sweet and smells heavenly so not too much to complain about . Very little coffee flavor , but a nice cup of fall flavor .####[['pumpkin spice Latte', 'positive'], ['pumpkin spice Latte', 'neutral']]

I tried out this cereal for the first time in many many years , having eaten it growing up . I was surprised to find out that there is no apple flavor what so ever .

We get Nutiva Organic EV coconut oil on a two month subscription . It ' s great . I like to mix a serving of pistachios , a serving of almonds , and a tbsp of oil together for a late evening treat .

I ' ve tried many green teas in the same price range , but I always come back to Stash Organic Green . This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste . It ' s light , vegetal and very smooth . To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas , and make sure the water temperature doesn ' t go over 180 degrees . I often mix this tea with cascade mint , jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it ' s very good by itself , plain green tea can get boring day - after - day . Contrary to the other reviewer , I don ' t like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder , and recommend this tea instead .####[['Stash Organic Green', 'positive']]
Though they might be a bit pricey for just the average dog owner like myself ( as opposed to say someone in a profession working with dogs ) , they ' re great treats .

I think this is a great product for the picky 2 - year old eater ( obviously younger children who are not ready for solid foods would also really benefit from this product . It can be sucked directly from the pouch or squeezed onto a spoon for feeding ) . My son ( the aforementioned picky eater ) eats fruits but no veggies , so I thought these pouches would be a good alternative to supplement his diet . He considers them a " treat " and gobbles them up . They are also a great traveling food - - perfect to pop in my purse when we are heading out . I love that they are organic , convenient and don ' t need to be refrigerated ( unless you open it ) .####[['product', 'positive']]

I purchased these chips since they are so much cheaper than what they cost on the grocery . they did not expire for about 2 months , but the first 2 or 3 bags we ate were stale , plus many were broken up . I wrote amazon and they did give me a prompt refund , so their customer service is excellent . we have since opened some more bags and they do not seem as stale , but I still do not believe they taste as fresh as the ones from grocery . I may try reordering these since they are such a good deal and hopefully can give a better review the next time .####[['amazon', 'positive'], ['chips', 'negative'], ['chips', 'positive']]
I was intrigued when I saw these for sale at my local grocery store . Using my employee discount ( I work there ) , I bought some . They are so good , that I had to immediately start passing them out to my customers ; I was fearful of tearing through the entire bag by myself !

I am a big fan of Cooking Light magazine . They regularly feature recipes using Israeli Couscous . I found it once at a local health food store , but it turned out that they had purchased it my mistake . I have driven 45 miles to the next biggest town to find it - even at specialty stores - and it is still pretty rare in these parts .

I have been drinking Essentia for about a month now and really feel it makes a difference in my hydration . I can tell that more now that I ran out and had to supplement my Amazon purchase with running to the store .

I use a Brita filter on both my faucet and through a pitcher and can tell the Essentia water has a smoother texture " feel " than the filtered water .

There is no finer chocolate in all the world , in my opinion . After I went vegan , I found myself pining for chocolate .

I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese . The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels .

Its really pretty good ! I found this is a pretty handy addition to many menu items , and a great alternative to basic taco sauce or salsa all the time . I like it best as a sauce for nachos and tacos , as it can stand up to heavier ingredients like beans and ground beef . I was a little concerned it would taste really artificial , but think it really is a good thing to have around the house actually . Its got a spicy yet well balanced flavor . I found it tastes especially good stirred in with a little sour cream to add lightness , and think it tasted really good with chicken .####[['sauce', 'positive'], ['sauce', 'negative']]

I guess I had no idea how good the goji berries were from Whole Foods until I tried these .

If you like top quality " stinky " cheese this is for you .####[['cheese', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems . We ' ve consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural , Chicken Soup for the dog lover ' s soul , Royal Canin , and a couple others that I can ' t remember off the top of my head . My Mom picked up this Newman ' s food because it was available at the grocery store . They love the food , but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically . His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before . This food seems like a real winner for us .####[["Newman ' s food", 'positive']]
Cafe Verona is our favorite coffee . It is bold and robust without being bitter . As far as the seller , everything was great there also . Package arrived on time , actually sooner than expected .

This is addressed to Amazon . Great Coffee , and used to be at a competitive price . I have been using several flavors and been very happy until I decided to shop some new flavors on Coffee Bean Direct products and discovered that the discounts are now 5 % instead of 15 % . Any reason ? Unhappy ! STEX####[['Coffee', 'positive'], ['Coffee Bean Direct', 'negative']]
My vet gave my dog medicine and pill pockets . Every morning she would look at us wanting a pill pocket . We would break it up into tiny pieces and reward her for doing various things . If you are trying to potty train your puppy , just get pill pockets because all dogs will go crazy for them . You can keep feeding them these after their medicine is done .####[['pill pockets', 'positive']]
I really don ' t have much to say but that this is the best purchase I ' ve made in over five years .

Of all the other hot cereals by Bob ' s Red Mill this one is my favorite . Every morning I have some of this cereal and sometimes at night too . It ' s really good and family enjoy it too .

These are great dog treats that are made with natural ingredients and my dogs love them . I give them these treats to provide the Glucosamine needed especially for my larger dogs . They get a very good grain free dog food but it does not contain glucosamine and my older dog needs it . Zuke ' s Hip Action really seems to help her . I have brought this item for several years and highly recommend it .####[['treats', 'positive']]
The reason for the poor review is that there was NO safety protection for this herb . No plastic wrapping , no safety seal . Who wants to use food products that are not protected ?

Eight O Clock 40 Oz . Columbian coffee never disappoints .

This sauce is gross ! I bought it knowing that it was a " diet " food , but didn ' t expect it to be that bad . It didn ' t taste anything like BBQ sauce .

Torani Sugar Free Raspberry Syrup is a great tasting , diabetic friendly flavoring . This syrup has a subtle and natural raspberry flavor that goes great in ice tea or mixed with club soda . The Splenda sweetener gives this just the right amount of sweetness , without the unpleasant aftertaste or gastric distress that other artificial sweeteners can cause . Highly Recommended !

I really love the classic Otter Pops , and the tropical ones taste pretty good . I did manage to find these at a local grocery store for $ 2 . 88 minus $ 1 . 00 mail in rebate for the same box of 100 . Score one for me and my daughter ! She loves them too .####[['classic Otter Pops', 'positive']]

These popchips ( original flavor ) are great tasting , low in fat , and a snack that is satisfying .

Very good ; very satisfying . Interesting blend of flavors - - dried fruit , cocoa , chili . Nothing dominates - all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat . I couldn ' t eat one every day , but for an occasional meal replacement , it is very good . Too high calorie to be a snack item , but it ' s tempting .####[['NULL', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
I ' ve been using K - cups and have tried different kinds . This is the best one yet ! ! I ' m a medium blend drinker and I ' ve found that its hard to find one that is good , yet not too bold . This one has a great coffee taste , yet not a " strong " flavor .####[['coffee', 'positive']]
The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee . The coffee was good , it just did not have the flavor I was expecting . Also this was a present for my dad and the way it was packaged the bag got two holes in it . Luckily only a small amount of coffee grounds were lost and I was able to patch the bag with tape . Although my dad felt obligated to use this coffee up as quickly as possible because he was worried the holes would effect how long it stayed fresh which is not how I would want him to feel about his present .####[['coffee', 'positive'], ['coffee', 'neutral'], ['coffee', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'negative']]
Love this brand and flavor of ramen . The upper tier , of this sort of food . I only ding it one star , because I have yet to see it available for Subscribe and Save .

I ' ve bought this tea a couple of times now  and I really like it . I ' m no fancy pants tea connoisseur , but I drink at least 4 cups of this tea a day , and certainly enjoy it . Definitely a good every day tea and at a good price ! I ' ll buy it again when I ' m out .####[['tea', 'positive']]
The oil itself is fine , but I have a problem with how the bottle is designed . Small amounts of oil accumulate on the wide metal area surrounding the cap , and fruit flies and other small insects will drown themselves in it . Then , if you ' re not careful , you ' ll pour dead bugs into your food ! Not cool . I would really prefer a differently - shaped bottle .####[['oil', 'positive']]
These are great snacks . I have been buying them for my toddler since I first saw them in my local grocery store . He loves the taste and they are much healthier than candy . I always have one in my jacket pocket or purse . The four rating is only because they are cheap but worth the money .####[['snacks', 'positive']]
This was an enjoyable and refreshing treat on a hot summer day . I poured the coffee over ice to enjoy it colder and it was very good . It has a strong , bold coffee flavor , not bitter , and is slightly sweetened but not very sweet . You could always add more sweetener to suit your taste , but I personally didn ' t find it necessary . At only 50 calories a can this is a nice light drink .####[['coffee', 'positive'], ['coffee', 'neutral']]
These are the best Triscuit Nabisco makes ! I can ' t understand why they are so hard to find in stores ! I ' m just thankful Amazon offers them with free shipping .

I purchased this tea for a neighbor when she had mentioned that she loved the taste . I then went and purchased a pack of 120 ( a bit much , I know ) but it was totally worth it . The tea has a spicy , yet citrus - y taste that is both refreshing and aromatic . I highly recommend this tea for anyone whom is looking for a new ' everyday ' flavor of tea .####[['tea', 'positive']]
These little bars are quite delicious and healthy . I originally bought these at Costco but saw these on sale one day on amazon so I decided to give them a shot . The bars that they sell at Costco are a bit larger 220 calories than these ones at 170 calories . I ordered 4 boxes and none of mine have been stale like some other reviewers have complained about . Worth the money .####[['bars', 'positive'], ['amazon', 'positive']]
These are tasty in a serious junk food kind of way , but that is not a surprise since this is candy melted onto corn chips : You eat these when you are craving salt and sugar and can ' t be bothered to pour a bag of M & Ms into a bowl of salted popcorn . They are seriously the perfect PMS cliche food . Make sure you put the amount you WANT to eat in a bowl or cup and then put the rest back in the pantry or else you will be left with and empty bag and a stomach ache ) FYI : I found these at the dollar store for a buck each .####[['NULL', 'positive']]
I ' m not familiar with the benefits of high pH water like this but if it ' s better for you than normal water then I ' d highly recommend this product because it tastes EXACTLY like regular filtered , bottled water . Some people have talked about different aftertastes or flavors but to me it tastes the same as other bottled waters , even when drunk back to back . If this is healthier than just drinking water it ' s a great option - no calories , no added ingredients to give flavor , etc . Basically just water with hidden health benefits .####[['water', 'positive']]

I received this as a gift a few weeks ago . It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had . The taste and consistancy is excellent .

I really like this particular magnesium supplement . In ice cold water it tastes much like lemonade ! It helps with minor muscle aches , headaches , and constipation . Just don ' t take too much !

This is the stuff from which the smoothest rum would be made ! The quality is unparalleled .

I was very disappointed in this product . I was expecting a nice coconut smell , but instead is was more like spoiled mayonnaise . In addition , it was excessively oily .

I was a bit surprised as some of the reviews here complained about the size . While not nearly as big as a standard pig ear , these make great tasty treats for my 60lb dogs .

I am torn : 4 stars or 5 stars ? I decided on 5 stars : - The taste is great ! If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker , then they may not be sweet enough for you . I am not , hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor . The nutritional content is not bad at all , except artificial flavoring , which I would never notice on my taste buds if it was not written . All - in - all - - absolutely delicious and filling snack !####[['snack', 'positive']]
When i initially purchased this item for my dog , i was a bit nervous . I had given her the food ( and had slightly heated it up ) and she smelled it and walked away . Now , however i do not heat it . . and she eats it . The reason i heated it was because she had preferred it with past wet food , but obviously this was better at room temperature .####[['NULL', 'positive']]
Mostly , this was good stuff . I haven ' t had this stuff in a long long time but decided to purchase some . Most of the jerky was good , but I ran into 1 too many pieces that was fatty or felt like a salty chunk of fat . I wish I would ' ve gotten pieces or a bag without any of it considering this is pretty damn expensive stuff , but it is good . They definitely need to work on quality control if they want to keep the prices so high for this stuff , or I might have to go to a different brand .####[['jerky', 'positive'], ['jerky', 'negative']]

I go through flours awfully quickly , since I ' m on a gluten - free diet and do all my own baking . This is good flour . I ' d hesitated to buy brown rice flour other than from Authentic Foods , given the praise for Authentic Food ' s fine grind in one of my favorite cookbooks .

My cats love this food and one of them doesn ' t usually touch canned food . I know that canned food is much better for them and I feel better that this product does not include unhealthy grains .

If I could give this product less than one star . I would . My dog became deathly ill a couple of hours after eating these treats .

Sorry , but everyone in my famiy thought this stuff was nasty .

Like others , I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it . I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine , my dog LOVED them like always ! When I went to re - order , I read the review about the treats now being " basted " with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird , because my order was the same . That is , until I received this last order of 4 packs this week . All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor - - my dog , who was usually so excited to get one of these treats , left it on the floor untouched . We are both VERY disappointed - - not at Amazon , but at the manufacturer for changing their product####[['product', 'positive'], ['product', 'negative']]

I had settled into buying Starbucks espresso beans from Costco frankly because of the great price . I prefer Starbucks Italian roast but the price on Starbucks espresso roast is too good .

It is very close to the Starbucks Italian roast . Sign up for a scheduled shipment on Amazon and get an even better price .####[['Lavazza Espresso Super Crema', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'positive']]

Get real , other reviewers ! This coffee right here is obviously at least TWICE as good as what you can get directly from Nespresso on its website .
