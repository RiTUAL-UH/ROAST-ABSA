My 14 month old loves these pouches and it ' s a great way of getting broccoli into her diet . she just started being able to do it herself recently , although it ' s sometimes messy .

Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father ' s lead ) , I ' ve never been an avid hot tea drinker . I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea . Healthy or not , this tea is delicious . I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar .

I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola .

My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew . If you don ' t , they ' re very , very crisp ( but still very good ) .

My dog absolutely loves these tiny treats . The size of the bag is nice because the amount of treats lasts a long time . Coaxing her to get into the car was difficult until I remembered that these treats worked so well with training why not tempt her into the car with these too , voila after about 5 mins no problem .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

I find this coffee has a distinctive flavor with a little bit of extra kick . I like it better than the other " Kona blend " K - cups that I ' ve tried and I feel that it is richer than the other such brands sold by Amazon .

These olives are an absolute steal based on what they sell for here on Amazon . They have a nice size to them and none of them have been soft .

I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me . Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach . After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click , I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews .

I love being able to make coffee on the run - and am very happy with the K - Cups . I liked the auto - delivery discount but was very disappointed with all the extra packaging before .

I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper . I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter , if your hot air popper has a lot of power , be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop .

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added .

We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food . Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we ' ve had them on . It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for ! When Amazon upped the price $ 10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals , but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen , but that awful smelling gas came back as well ! ! We are putting them back on Canidae . It ' s worth it ! !####[['Amazon', 'upped the price $ 10 a bag'], ['Canidae', 'amazingly well on this food'], ['Canidae', 'coats looked better'], ['Canidae', 'even eliminated the horrible gas'], ['Amazon', 'worth it'], ['Canidae', 'putting them back']]
This is good coffee . I think it is just short of 5 - start rating . The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast . Bold coffee drinkers could probably make it stronger and enjoy a bold taste due to the fine grinding . I don ' t think any coffee drinkers will be displeased with this roast . We made a pot for a dinner party and everyone gave it the thumbs up !####[['coffee', 'good'], ['coffee', 'just short of 5 - start rating'], ['coffee', 'boldness and dark roast is tempered'], ['coffee', 'enjoy a bold taste'], ['coffee', 'everyone gave it the thumbs up'], ['coffee', "don ' t think any coffee drinkers will be displeased"]]
I like sweet stuff , and I usually get the trail mixes with M & Ms in it but since i ' m trying to eat better , I tried the 2 oz bag frm CVS it was only a dollar and WOW ITS GOOD ! LOL I immediately went back and bought like 5 more to snack on while at work ! HIGHLY recommended !####[['CVS', 'only a dollar'], ['CVS', 'WOW ITS GOOD'], ['CVS', 'HIGHLY recommended']]
I will keep this short . I love these things . They taste exactly like Frosted Flakes cereal but in a twisty form . You probably could break these up and put them in milk and eat them for breakfast just like frosted flakes . The Taste is that similar .####[['NULL', 'love'], ['NULL', 'taste exactly like Frosted Flakes cereal'], ['NULL', 'Taste is that similar'], ['NULL', 'twisty form'], ['NULL', 'breakfast just like frosted flakes']]
I eat a teaspoon of coconut oil at night to maintain regularity . I ' ve also found that certain foods taste better when cooking in coconut oil . I ' ve tried several brands , but the Nutiva brands tastes best to me . I dinged this review one star because these jars are made of plastic rather than glass . If they shipped in glass jars Nutiva coconut oil would be a perfect product .####[['Nutiva coconut oil', 'tastes best'], ['Nutiva coconut oil', 'jars are made of plastic rather than glass']]
I always make sure I ' m stocked with these bones to occupy my dog for at least 30 - 60 minutes at a time . He chews the same bone for 2 or 3 days . He satisfies his chewing instinct and stays away from my boyfriend ' s shoes . They ' re perfect for medium sized dogs who are powerful chewers . i thought this cake would good by the reviews . i could not believe the texture , it was like jello , really strange . i had 4 other people try it and they felt the same way . very unhappy####[['bones', 'chews the same bone for 2 or 3 days'], ['bones', 'satisfies his chewing instinct'], ['bones', 'perfect for medium sized dogs'], ['bones', 'like jello , really strange'], ['bones', 'very unhappy']]
