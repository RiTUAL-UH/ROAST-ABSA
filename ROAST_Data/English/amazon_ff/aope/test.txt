I grabbed a variety of various protein / energy bars , including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt . The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides . The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing , unfortunately . Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful , but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one .

My dog has had some skin issues ( about a month after we adopted him we found out that he has mange ) , and his coat wasn ' t looking very nice .

I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe . Whenever I put it out at feeding time , there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot ' s Stew in them . With 5 kitty mouths to feed , the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot ' s Stew , so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied . Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting , those poor things that had to " settle " for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew . I have been so pleased with it , that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners .

If my dog likes something , he wolfs it down fast and if he doesn ' t , he ' ll give it a sniff and walk away . He really liked Chef Michael ' s Grilled Sirloin Dog Food . The bits that are shaped and formed to look like roast beef are slightly soft and chewy and the hard bits of kibble are dyed , which seems unnecessary .

I purchased this in spite of prior customer reviews that said this drink was not sweet . I found it to be horrible tasting . It is much too bitter to drink , even with adding sweetener .

This is an excellent , cost - effective alternative to Red Bull .

Buying K - Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have . People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup - count .

After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it , I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come .

This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !####[['matcha', 'delicious'], ['matcha', 'pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely'], ['matcha', 'smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves'], ['matcha', "wasn ' t unpleasant"], ['matcha', 'just totally unexpected'], ['matcha', 'smell carries over'], ['matcha', 'just the beginning part of the taste'], ['matcha', 'initially seems a bit spicy'], ['matcha', 'morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor'], ['matcha', 'definitely takes on an earthy flavor'], ['matcha', 'nutty flavors really work well with matcha'], ['matcha', 'great energizing drink']]

Unfortunately , I am stuck with 480 mints that I do not like because you cannot return these kind of items to Amazon ( which makes sense , I guess ) . Anyway , when you first put the mint in your mouth there is no taste . Zero . Then , as the mint gets crumbly - - not in a slow dissolve way but just a fall apart way - - you get a little mint .

In researching dandelion root , I came across a lot of different , sometimes contradictory claims , none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research . I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect , and it is supposedly good for the liver . Again , those claims may be dubious , but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason ( caffeine , acid ) . It tasted terrible to me at first , but after about 4 cups I really started to like it . I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes .

I use a ton of " greenies " or other dental products for my little dog ( a 7 lb Yorkie / Maltese mix . ) She used to hate it when I left the house , so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only .

I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system , but I ' ve seen no problem thus far , and I ' ve been using them for over a week .

100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers .

I ' ve tried many green teas in the same price range , but I always come back to Stash Organic Green . This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste .

I have one cat who is really not into canned food at all - unusual , I know . But , I put down a can of Merrick ' s ' California Roll ' and she totally ignored the dry food that I had mixed with her favorite treat , Kitty Kaviar ( fish flakes ) and dove into the canned . I think she ate close to the entire can by herself , in fact , purring like crazy the entire time ! If you have a picky eater , try this food . I think you ' ll be pleasantly surprised !

This has been one of my favorite flavors of Kool - Aid for as long as it has been around . Not available in any store locally , I gladly pay the slightly higher price to buy it from Amazon . com .

I had bought a Black and Decker one - cup coffee maker that used these pods . It didn ' t work properly , but I have managed to use the pods with my old , stand - by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience . Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging . I have not encountered that problem . Overall , I am pleased with this purchase .####[['pods', 'please with the flavor'], ['pods', 'pleased with this purchase']]

I go through flours awfully quickly , since I ' m on a gluten - free diet and do all my own baking . This is good flour . I ' d hesitated to buy brown rice flour other than from Authentic Foods , given the praise for Authentic Food ' s fine grind in one of my favorite cookbooks . However , now that I ' ve tried this ( much cheaper ) brown flour , I really don ' t see much difference . It ' s now the only brown flour I use .####[['flour', 'good'], ['flour', 'much cheaper'], ['flour', "really don ' t see much difference"]]
My cats love this food and one of them doesn ' t usually touch canned food . I know that canned food is much better for them and I feel better that this product does not include unhealthy grains . There is a lot of juice in this , but the picky cat really likes to lick up the juice . I haven ' t seen any problems with vomiting since I switched them to this .####[['product', 'love this food'], ['product', 'not include unhealthy grains'], ['product', 'lot of juice in this'], ['product', 'really likes to lick up the juice'], ['product', "haven ' t seen any problems"]]
If I could give this product less than one star . I would . My dog became deathly ill a couple of hours after eating these treats . I contacted the company to warn them of the potential contamination , and they never even bothered to return my call . A bad product , from an even worse company .####[['product', 'deathly ill a couple of hours after eating these treats'], ['product', 'bad product']]
Sorry , but everyone in my famiy thought this stuff was nasty . If you just use a few drops , it tastes like watered down Kool - Aid , but if you put in a few more drops , it tastes so sweet you almost need an insulin shot after ! No happy medium there . Won ' t be buying this stuff anytime soon , sorry , might be a great conveinience for some , but why bother if it ' s gross !####[['NULL', 'stuff was nasty'], ['NULL', 'No happy medium there'], ['NULL', "Won ' t be buying this stuff anytime soon"]]
These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code . It was nice to have a larger size bag . Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch ! They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been . Great flavor and All Natural !####[['Amazon', 'great deal with the promo code'], ['Kettle Chips', 'nice to have a larger size bag'], ['Amazon', 'arrived fresh'], ['Amazon', 'not in crumbles'], ['Kettle Chips', 'Great flavor and All Natural']]
Fantastic organic coffee , cheaper than I can get in the store locally . I like to drink organic coffee to reduce pesticide exposure , but the cost stops me from buying it . With subscribe and save , I end up paying the same amount for this organic as I do for conventional in the store ! I wish I could tell you why this coffee tasters so delicious , but I don ' t know how . Try it !####[['coffee', 'Fantastic organic'], ['coffee', 'cheaper'], ['coffee', 'reduce pesticide exposure'], ['coffee', 'tasters so delicious'], ['coffee', 'Try it']]
I ' ve noticed a big difference in my dog ' s weight = she ' s able to maintain her weight , not gaining as much weight as when she ate dried dog food . And being a white dog , she doesn ' t get dark teary eyes when she eats only Newman organic dog food . I highly recommend it .####[['Newman organic dog food', 'highly recommend'], ['Newman organic dog food', "noticed a big difference in my dog ' s weight"], ['Newman organic dog food', "doesn ' t get dark teary eyes"]]
Like others , I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it . I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine , my dog LOVED them like always ! When I went to re - order , I read the review about the treats now being " basted " with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird , because my order was the same . That is , until I received this last order of 4 packs this week . All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor - - my dog , who was usually so excited to get one of these treats , left it on the floor untouched . We are both VERY disappointed - - not at Amazon , but at the manufacturer for changing their product####[['product', 'LOVED them like always'], ['product', 'basted or really more like stained in duck flavor'], ['product', 'left it on the floor untouched'], ['product', 'both VERY disappointed']]

I had settled into buying Starbucks espresso beans from Costco frankly because of the great price . I prefer Starbucks Italian roast but the price on Starbucks espresso roast is too good . My daughter introduced me to Lavazza Espresso Super Crema recently and have found it to be an excellent product . It is Italian roasted and has a wonderfully full aroma and flavor . It is very close to the Starbucks Italian roast . Sign up for a scheduled shipment on Amazon and get an even better price .####[['Lavazza Espresso Super Crema', 'excellent'], ['Lavazza Espresso Super Crema', 'wonderfully full aroma and flavor'], ['Lavazza Espresso Super Crema', 'very close to the Starbucks Italian roast'], ['Amazon', 'better price']]
I have always enjoyed See ' s Candy in the past . However , this candy seemed old . The color of the chocolates had a whiteish color like they have been packaged for a long time .

Get real , other reviewers ! This coffee right here is obviously at least TWICE as good as what you can get directly from Nespresso on its website . Nespresso is clearly fobbing off inferior product - - probably coffee beans made in China , or maybe even Taiwan ! Ninety - nine ninety - nine here at Amazon , or fifty - seven at Nespresso - your choice . Just remember : you get what you pay for . . . right ?####[['Nespresso', 'obviously at least TWICE as good'], ['Nespresso', 'clearly fobbing off inferior'], ['Amazon', 'ninety - nine here']]
My husband is addicted to coffee at the local gas station so I bought this so he does not have to drive 5 miles to get coffee . It is the closest I have found . Thank you .####[['coffee', 'closest']]

I ' ve eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best . The extra cost of boneless / skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste .

I got these at snacks for my toddler ( 20 months ) . They ' re pretty convenient , but I don ' t love the taste of them , and neither does my daughter .

I bought Grand Arome by Poulain in France in 2001 and love it ! Everytime anyone from my family goes back to France , this is the one item I ask them to bring back to me . I find that , not only is it delicious , but when I have one mug full of hot cocoa in the morning with two pieces of toast , that I don ' t get hungry again all morning . I actually lose weight when I stick to this for breakfast .

I never thought it would happen . I have become a hot sauce junkie . I have tried many hot sauces , some with habenaros , and some with ghost peppers . All in all this one is my favorite . It is hot enough to be hot , yet not so hot that you have to be careful . The taste is outstanding , I put it in everything .####[['hot sauce', 'one is my favorite'], ['hot sauce', 'hot enough to be hot'], ['hot sauce', 'taste is outstanding']]
