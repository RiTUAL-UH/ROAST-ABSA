I ' m still disappointed with the " lower sodium " label . f course you will get less sodium if you decrease the amount in the cup by 50 % ! he large Mc Dougall soup cups contain two servings typically - have you tried to share one or keep it for another day ?

I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['coffee beans', 'roast more of their coffee beans this way'], ['coffee beans', 'right amount of roasting'], ['coffee beans', 'taste is excellent'], ['coffee beans', '" mostly " excellent'], ['coffee beans', 'flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking'], ['coffee beans', 'certainly a welcome addition to the cycle'], ['coffee beans', 'giving it a 4 / 5'], ['coffee beans', 'not a fan of their tendency to char - broil']]

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy .

When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean . What I opened this morning was not what I had expected . To be clear , I was greatly dissapointed . I found bits of husk from the bean , which doesn ' t make coffee , and is considered filler . The flavor left something to be desired as well , it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid .

This is a good idea in theory , especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks .

All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin - enriched " tasty pastes " available from Kong .

This is my favorite energy bar . Most of the time I prefer to eat real food , but there are occasions ( long hikes , motorcycle trips ) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished , and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up . I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos .

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth . I do not understand why these are so hard to find , as even other web shops appear to no longer carry these , it ' s a shame : (####[['NULL', 'loved every flavor'], ['NULL', 'totally worth it'], ['NULL', 'perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour'], ['web shops', 'hard to find']]
I really love these . After trying many different brands I decided that this is my favorite . They are soft and fresh - tasting , and also come with lots of liquid . They are also from domestically caught fish , and even though canned in Asia , the cans are BPA - free which is not common in the industry .

I am new to dog training but I learned real quick that they will respond much better if they love the treats . Our dog really loves these and they are just the right size for training .

The price is not bad either .####[['NULL', 'really loves these'], ['NULL', 'right size'], ['price', 'not bad either']]

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the " default " brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .####[['McCormick spices', 'flavorful'], ['McCormick spices', 'inexpensive']]

This is the original blend from Starbucks and it ' s not sold in all areas . For those of us who can ' t get to a Costco or find a store that carries this , this is a perfect find .

One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['Kangen', 'NULL']]
I ordered a couple different cookies from Scott ' s Cakes . I loved every single one of them .

While saving money is a key factor in purchasing this , I am basing my review on the taste of the product . Overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged K - cups . It does not compare to the Tully Pre - Packaged French Roast that I am used to drinking . As noted by other reviewers , I don ' t know the Eco friendliness of the packaging , since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch .

I didn ' t know there were supposed to be actual chunks of dark chocolate in the bag , mine melted into the granola a bit making some slighlty bigger granola clusters . It was fine that way , but I ' d be curious if I ordered the granola in a chillier season what it would be like . The granola is fine , the dark chocolate is a fine perk , but it does feel like there ' s something missing . The sweetners for the most part are natural sweetners .

Since this is a product review , I ' ll focus on the product itself .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .####[['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'love the taste'], ['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'excellent quality']]

I think this is a good powder for people who don ' t like stuff that is sweet - I couldn ' t really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all , so for me this doesn ' t work as a standalone protein powder .

It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way .

Just a word of caution . . . you ' d better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor .

They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips .####[['Pop Chips', 'absolutely love'], ['Pop Chips', 'crispy'], ['Pop Chips', 'flavorful']]
As truffle lovers , we took a truffle hunting trip with Truffle Hunters , the makers of this oil . We returned with several bottles of their truffle oil and I can say that this is the best truffle oil on the market . You can tell it is authentic , not flavored with artificial , chemical flavors , because you can see actual truffle shavings in each bottle . We ' re so pleased to know that we ' ll be able to replenish our supply on Amazon , rather than having to contact the company in the UK . Now if only they would also sell their wonderful truffles on Amazon ! !####[['oil', 'best truffle oil on the market'], ['oil', 'authentic'], ['oil', 'not flavored with artificial , chemical flavors'], ['Amazon', 'NULL']]
This product retails at $ 4 . 99 . I assumed the price was due to the description saying the shipping weight was 6 lb , meaning I would received a larger amount .

I bought this 2 pack of Nestle Dark Chocolate cocoa packets for the office . Unfortunately , even with sugar as ingredient # 1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient # 2 , Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose ( a sugar substitute , Splenda equivalent ) as a final ingredient . That makes for a nasty , saccharin - y , hypersweet and artificial aftertaste . Nasty . Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss .

I was sure that there was never a chip that I loved enough to give it 5 stars .

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product####[['Sweet Leaf line', 'best flavor'], ['Sweet Leaf line', 'recommend this product']]

We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year , so we ' ve been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible . This coffee is - - BAR NONE - - the best of the bunch . It is rich , syrupy and just a bit sweet . My experience , thus far , has been that the K - Cups listed as " extra bold " produce the best cups of coffee , but many of those are only available in dark roasts , while I prefer a medium roast . If you ' re a fan of a good , old fashioned diner - style cup of coffee ( like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that ) , then this is the brew for you .

I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses . these chips are so damn good . they have a great light crispy texture .

So glad to see Amazon has picked up this product as it is hard to find in my area and it can be delivered right to my door for the same pet store cost without driving across town to get it ( after I special order it ) . As one reviewer mentioned , only a raw diet is better than this one .####[['Amazon', 'NULL'], ['dry dog food', 'very best']]

I got into Larabars , because I am trying to eat more natural , less packaged food . Yes Larabars come in a package , but they do not have any preservatives , chemicals , or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce . Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients . It ' s refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce , understand , and visualize each ingredient . My favorite flavors are Coconut ( SO YUMMY ) , Lemon ( tastes like a lemon square , very tart ) , and Banana ( tastes freakishly like banana bread ) . These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full .####[['Larabars', 'satisfy your sweet tooth'], ['Larabars', 'NULL']]
Perhaps the previous reviewer is starting out with polluted water , because if anything , Revolution Teas have a very clean and simple taste . Their Golden Flowers version is no exception . Probably one of the best Chamomile blends that I ' ve ever had , it has a very natural and un - adulterated flavor . It ' s not one of the most expensive teas on the market , yet manages to be steps above the crushed leaf standard teas that most people are used to . This is a very soothing tea , perfect for a post - dinner experience .####[['Revolution Teas', 'very clean and simple taste'], ['Revolution Teas', 'no exception'], ['Revolution Teas', 'very natural and un - adulterated flavor'], ['Revolution Teas', 'very soothing']]

I found this vinegar over 10 years ago and was immediately addicted . Smooth , well - rounded with no bitter taste .

Get the carrot & apple or pear & mango flavor from Plum Organics instead . This was overwhelmingly sweet . Like giving my babies candy . The " Yello One " is almost as bad .

The product is superior , although not perhaps the tastiest . However if I switched from junk food to vegan , I suspect the result might be the same . And the price is great .

Very disappointed in the condition of the Eight O ' Clock Italian Roast I received . Coffee tasted very stale . I didn ' t expect to receive short - coded product from Amazon .

I ' ve had German Chocolate Cake coffee from a company no longer availabe in my area . This one did not match up for me . I think the packaging was mislabled ? ? ?

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['NULL', 'weak hot chocolate'], ['NULL', 'absolutely do not reccomend']]
Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix . I had been using the regular mix for both waffles and pancakes with outstanding results , and then I stumbled upon the All Natural mix . I am frankly not sure what the main differences are between the regular mix and the all natural mix , but with kids around the house , it seemed like a no - brainer to be using the All Natural . The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural , and I still get requests all the time from my kids for " Daddy ' s Waffles " and " Daddy ' s Pancakes " .

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description .

My only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice . It made a great , satisfying supper . Pat well now i no longer have to wait for friends to send me arabic coffee from palestine i can make it myself here in the US of A . i typically roast a handfull of cardamon and then mix it with the Arabic Yemini coffee - also from amazon - and grind it realy fine . this makes a perfect cup of coffee . cardamon is also great on ground meat , i usualy add it to my burgers and they taste fabulous .####[['NULL', 'excellent'], ['amazon', 'NULL']]
I recently bought a Keurig Coffee maker because my husband and I love our coffee and tea , but sometimes want different drinks on certain days and this coffee maker fit the bill .

But it doesn ' t stop there . This is great on eggs , vegetables and any other type of meat . And to think I found this little gem while searching for my favorite Christmas music . What a stroke of luck ; their seasonings are as good as their music ! I like this slightly better than Grilling Salt because this tastes slightly saltier , without being too salty . Try both to see which is your favorite ; I don ' t think you can go wrong with either of these delicious seasonings !####[['NULL', 'good']]
If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement . It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .####[['Carba Nada', 'good replacement'], ['Carba Nada', 'cooks in only 5 minutes']]

I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet . It ' s soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations , but still holds its shape as it dries out . It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months . The 7 oz . tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size , but the multipack is a nice option for this reason . I ' ll be buying this brand again .####[['marzipan', 'nice , natural almond taste'], ['marzipan', "isn ' t too sweet"], ['marzipan', 'buying this brand again']]

I am not , as a rule , a big fan of herbal teas , but I ' ll give anything a try .

The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack . The lemon flavor is not overpowering and doesn ' t have a " fake " taste that other diet products seem to have .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .####[['real maple syrup', 'FANTASTIC'], ['real maple syrup', 'Organic'], ['real maple syrup', 'NULL']]

Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint . According to the label , this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk . It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber . For 210 or 250 calories , I think it should have more flavor , but for those who don ' t like any sugar in cereal , this works out well , especially if they prefer a high - fiber one .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs .

If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices .

Finally , someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor . If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil , top 3 being french fries , donuts and potato chips . Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it ' s fried .

However , to break it down - - it was one of the smoothest coffees I ' ve ever had , like drinking silk . The flavor was mild , pleasant , but for me , the taste was too bland , did not stand out .

Since cats are obligate carnivores , high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy . When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain , useless fillers and by - products from their formulas .

Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new .

When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs .

I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar - induced drinks , and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners , it tastes pretty good ! Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint . But the key is dumping some rum in there .

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them . She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis . Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things .

This is a decaffienated version of Stash ' s chai spice tea , made from blended black teas , ginger , cinnamon , allspice , nutmeg , cloves , and natural flavors of cinnamon , clove , and cardamom .

If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do , you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper , albeit beautiful , since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna . Stated differently , it is a one dollar jalapeno . However , less is more here because the flavor that results from steeping the tuna in that pepper and in the top quality olive oil is incomparable . Worth every penny . An awesome delicacy .####[['jalapeno in the jar', 'expensive'], ['jalapeno in the jar', 'beautiful'], ['jalapeno in the jar', 'incomparable'], ['jalapeno in the jar', 'awesome delicacy'], ['jalapeno in the jar', 'Worth every penny']]
I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs . He loves it and , in my view , it is a very healthy dog formula . I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein . My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select . I rate this product 5 stars .####[['Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula', 'loves'], ['Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula', 'very healthy'], ['Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula', 'has not had any problems'], ['Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula', 'rate this product 5 stars']]
I love this smaller size coffee can 3 cans equal one large container and it ' s cheaper than you can buy it in the grocery stores . I go through a can a week which is perfect because the coffee is fresh until the end - unlike the bigger containers which would taste stale after not even 2 weeks of being opened . And since I use the subscribe & save feature for this , I don ' t even have to put coffee on my shopping list anymore .

This is amazing salt ! A friend brought me my first bag from the Cook Islands . It is light and very nice on the tooth . I wish I could buy it in 5 lb bags .

I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor . All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) .

Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt ! I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts . This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet , in moderation . Why would anyone continue using the " white death " table salt that is void of so many essential elements ? I also use this to make an all - natural facial and body scrub ! We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it . It made a great mothers day gift , as no place around here sells anything remotely close to it . Yes the flower is not real as bamboo plants do not flower , but it does look nice .

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as " generous .

The blueberry is very tasty but watch out when you open a bottle . We have now had 3 bottles that were bad .

This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh .

Very disappointed in this product ! Thus tastes nothing like the product sold in the 1 1 / 2 lb . bag that this company sells . Has an after taste that tastes exactly like artificial sweeteners .

Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease .

I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread .

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth .

I would love Saco Mix ' n Drink even more if only it were organic ( grass fed , non - drugged cows ) , but I called the 800 number on the box , and was told that they had not yet reached that level of purity . I still use it in spite of that little fault , putting it directly from the box into my tea , and into any recipes calling for milk . I always add more of it than the recipe calls for ( ie : recipe calls for 1 / 2 c . milk - I add twice as much powder to the water .

First of all , I hate buying bottled water because I feel like it ' s such a rip off when I can take a good hydroflask water bottle , fill it with tap water and ice cubes , and have long - lasting cold water . However , I have to be honest and say that I loved the smooth taste of this water . I can ' t really speak to the " healthiness " of it , but on pure taste alone , I would buy this water for a refreshing drink . The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth !

Recently I have discovered Amazon ' s auto - shipment of the dog food which is great , since the stores that sell it is quite a drive .

I ' ve always been a fan of Lipton ' s caffeinated tea . However , I was very disappointed by the decaf version .

WONDERFUL TEA ! Much better than their tea bags . This is a MUST HAVE in our home as we both enjoy a cuppa to start and end most days . We were using the actual tea bags for years .

While using the K - cups is not as cost effective , IT CERTAINLY DOES MAKE EACH CUP A PERFECT EXPERIENCE ! ! ! !####[['TEA', 'WONDERFUL'], ['TEA', 'Much better than their tea bags'], ['TEA', 'so inexpensive'], ['TEA', 'CERTAINLY DOES MAKE EACH CUP A PERFECT EXPERIENCE']]

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed . As you can tell , I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand - - perfect for a northeast winter ' s day !####[['Comida Loca soups', 'flavors are crisp and balanced'], ['Comida Loca soups', 'not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp'], ['Comida Loca soups', 'just the right balance and thickness'], ['Comida Loca soups', 'not " open and serve soups'], ['Comida Loca soups', 'terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed'], ['Comida Loca soups', "perfect for a northeast winter ' s day"]]

Other than pricing for the coffee which is all over the map ( anywhere from $ . 40 per cup to $ . 75 ) the coffee itself is excellent . . Just have to look around for the deals every two to four weeks , depending on how much I can buy at once . . . the only negative is I like big cups of coffee - 10 to 12 ounce cups - and there are very few blends or brands that sell cartridges designed to brew these larger sizes so I end up using two coffee cartridges to brew one cup of coffee . it gets expensive and I haven ' t perfected using the generic cartridge to brew the perfect cup of coffee like the disposable cartridges produce . . .####[['coffee', 'excellent'], ['coffee', 'expensive'], ['coffee', 'larger sizes']]

I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas . This one had a very strong , very strange flavor . It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea . I think another reviewer who described it as a " burnt " flavor may have gotten it right .

I really like tacos and Spanish rice . Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack , it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium .

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself .

When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts !

I ' m a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the " bold " flavors . The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second . I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor . Its a nice balance . I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom .####[['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'big fan'], ['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'especially like the " bold " flavors'], ['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite'], ['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'tartness of the lime flavor is just enough'], ['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'nice balance'], ['Blue Diamond brand almonds', 'end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming']]

I first purchased these at Costco but since I don ' t always see them there , I jumped at the chance to order them when I saw them on Amazon . If you ' re not a big dark chocolate fan , I still recommend them because the chocolate is pretty mellow , not bitter like some dark chocolates .

I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication . I am not sure it helps him that much at all , but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it . Which is good , because my insomnia was driving me absolutely nuts ! I have to get more 100 % cranberry juice , because I prefer this mixed in with juice than I do with water .####[['NULL', 'help me calm down'], ['NULL', 'good']]
I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing ! So thick and creamy , especially if you make it with a little milk !

As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers . I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot . This was a dissapointment .

I was truly disappointed . If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this . There is nothing Chai about this product . Now I find out that this product is not eligible for return .

I have three cats , and was having trouble finding a dry cat food that all three would eat in between canned food feedings , so I decided to give this one a try .

If you love coconut , then this is for you . As a bona fide coco - ' nut ' , I can tell you this product is delicious . crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes .

Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid . I thought it was just ok . A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me . It ' s pretty much the same as Coffee People ' s Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call I can ' t tell the three apart .

Recieved the package on time , but there was a glitch with the order . I hadn ' t recieved the cat food I had ordered .

I bought this product , remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage . To my surprise , the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet . Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup , and the difference is obvious . Ferrara : sugar , water , almond extract , citric acid , artificial color , 1 / 10th of 1 % sodium benzoate ( as preservative ) Monin : Pure cane sugar , water , natural almond flavorI rest my case .####[['Monin Almond Syrup', 'sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough'], ['Monin Almond Syrup', 'make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet']]

Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label . The dosage amount of Glucosamine / Chondroitin is vague .

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them .

I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor . The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container , just paper . However , the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod , consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect . Alas , we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore .####[['Senseo coffee', 'easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor'], ['Senseo coffee', 'pods are much easier to composite']]

This has been our favorite chili for years , and we ' ve tried many . We ' ve even thrown away a partial case of another brand bought at a big box store .
