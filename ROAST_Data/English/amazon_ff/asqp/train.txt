I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['coffee beans', 'food quality', 'positive', 'roast more of their coffee beans this way'], ['coffee beans', 'food quality', 'positive', 'right amount of roasting'], ['coffee beans', 'food quality', 'positive', 'taste is excellent'], ['coffee beans', 'food quality', 'positive', '" mostly " excellent'], ['coffee beans', 'food quality', 'negative', 'flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking'], ['coffee beans', 'food general', 'positive', 'certainly a welcome addition to the cycle'], ['coffee beans', 'food general', 'positive', 'giving it a 4 / 5'], ['coffee beans', 'food general', 'negative', 'not a fan of their tendency to char - broil']]

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy .

I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos .

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth .

I was referred to this particular chai after trying another that was just too weak and boy was I disappointed .

I usually have these after dinner and its pretty nice . Doesn ' t have a clean ( refreshing ) after taste as I would have expected from a herbal mint tea but its fairly ok .

If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) .

The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all .

Excellent , simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised . I consider it to be a medium roast / breakfast blend kind of coffee . If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this " soup " tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .####[['Kenya AA', 'food general', 'positive', 'Excellent'], ['Kenya AA', 'food quality', 'positive', 'not bitter']]

I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon .

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world .

This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle .

One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['Kangen', 'food general', 'positive', 'NULL']]

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions .

I have eaten several bags of Barbara ' s Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor .

This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them . We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags . The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal . The chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt . They have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients . What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip ! i was introduced to these chips by a friend . i couldnt find them local , so i got them here . they are the BEST chips super addicting . even my sister who gags at the taste of onions LOVES these chips . the delivery was speedy and it is well worth ordering a box . super tasty !####[['Kettle Potato Chips', 'food general', 'positive', 'love them'], ['Kettle Potato Chips', 'food quality', 'positive', 'delicious'], ['delivery', 'shipment delivery', 'positive', 'speedy'], ['Kettle Potato Chips', 'food general', 'positive', 'well worth'], ['Kettle Potato Chips', 'food quality', 'positive', 'super tasty']]

I ' m a bit of a cinnamon junky and have collected many variants of this tasty treat . There are a few better products but still I keep coming back to McCormick as it has been consistently good .

I love to boil or pressure cook 6 or 7 sticks and mix with black tea for a killer batch of ice tea .

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something .

I had powered matcha tea at my local coffee shop and this was nothing like what I expected . It tasted quite a bit like seaweed . I managed to drink a little of this but it needed much doctoring . It became tolerable if I added sugar , ginger and milk . It also did not dissolve well even when I used my hand held blender . I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses . these chips are so damn good . they have a great light crispy texture . The sweet potato flavor is noticeable without being overly done . I enjoy there slight saltiness . Amazon sells them here cheaper than i can find in the store .

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'weak hot chocolate'], ['NULL', 'food recommendation', 'negative', 'absolutely do not reccomend']]
Not much to say that hasn ' t been said before about the Carbon ' s Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix . I had been using the regular mix for both waffles and pancakes with outstanding results , and then I stumbled upon the All Natural mix . I am frankly not sure what the main differences are between the regular mix and the all natural mix , but with kids around the house , it seemed like a no - brainer to be using the All Natural . The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural , and I still get requests all the time from my kids for " Daddy ' s Waffles " and " Daddy ' s Pancakes " .

Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock .

I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap .

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description .

If you ' re watching your carbs and miss egg noodles , Carba Nada is a good replacement . It isn ' t greatly low carb , but quite a bit less than regular pasta so you need to watch serving sizes , but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well . The different flavours add more variety , and its also easy to toss with some butter , parmesan , and seasonings . Add leftover chicken or beef , and some vegetables , and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs .####[['Carba Nada', 'food general', 'positive', 'good replacement'], ['Carba Nada', 'food general', 'positive', 'cooks in only 5 minutes']]

I ' ve tried many brands of marzipan and found this one great to eat plain or use in making cake decorations or candies . It has a nice , natural almond taste and isn ' t too sweet . It ' s soft enough to roll out or shape for making fruits or other decorations , but still holds its shape as it dries out . It stores well as long as you wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and a bag and also can be frozen up to 3 months . The 7 oz . tube is fairly small and I wish they made a larger size , but the multipack is a nice option for this reason .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic .

Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs .

It ' s one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee ( which I like ) , for caffeine , and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout , plus ease the acid build - up in the muscles that can make you want to puke .

This turned out to be a very tasty dish . It says just add beef , but you will also need to supply the rice or potatoes for it to go over , there is quite a bit of sauce . It has a thick spicy curry flavor and I found the longer the rice sat in it the better the taste  so you might want to add the cooked rice right to the pan instead of over the top . Very good , will make this again . this is my drink of choice . I ' m addicted . I drink 3 - 4 cups a day simply because nothing else tastes this good . I ' ve tried other chai - spice teas ; none of them compare . The downside to telling everyone to buy this tea is the prospect that you might actually do it , raising the prices .

I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar . It would be nice if I could get a caffeinated version , but I guess I ' ll have to stick to Lipton Black Pearl Tea for that .####[['rooibos tea', 'food quality', 'positive', 'delicious']]

This is the best green tea I have run across , cause they say we got a drink it , you know ? It has a fresh mild taste , but does not have that grassy taste like you ' re drinking something that was part of your lawn .

This is amazing salt ! A friend brought me my first bag from the Cook Islands . It is light and very nice on the tooth . I wish I could buy it in 5 lb bags .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor . All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .####[['ginger tea', 'food quality', 'negative', 'unnatural harshness'], ['ginger tea', 'food quality', 'negative', 'bitterness'], ['ginger tea', 'food quality', 'negative', 'use of some mutant low quality ginger'], ['ginger tea', 'food quality', 'negative', 'awful bitterness / dryness']]

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better .

My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best .

We drink a lot of tea in our household - black , green , white and a variety of herbal . This Bigelows Earl Grey has been a favorite of ours since discovering it at a Walmart ( where it sells for about $ 2 a box ; it sells for around $ 4 at our local grocery store . ) The nice thing about Bigelows teas is that each tea bag comes in a sealed packet so the flavor remains fresh . We enjoy this tea with Splenda and sometimes with lemon for extra flavor . If microwaving your water , make sure it gets good and hot to get the most out of your teabag ; if the water isn ' t hot enough , the flavor is a little weak .####[['Bigelows Earl Grey', 'food general', 'positive', 'favorite'], ['Bigelows Earl Grey', 'food quality', 'positive', 'flavor remains fresh'], ['Bigelows Earl Grey', 'food style_options', 'positive', 'sealed packet'], ['Bigelows Earl Grey', 'food general', 'positive', 'enjoy']]
I cooked noodle soups using the chicken soup as the base . The chicken soup turned out to be a little salty . I added noodles and vegetables into the soup without adding extra salt . But it is still a little salty . So , I had to add water and make it more tasty . a single pump in my coffee is heaven . we ' ve been trying all the other sugar - free flavors , but vanilla is always # 1 . it ' s awesome to mix in with plain yogurt too ! bf even mixes it in his milk with cereal . can ' t go wrong with this stuff ! oh and the pump is a must have .####[['chicken soup', 'food quality', 'negative', 'little salty'], ['chicken soup', 'food quality', 'negative', 'little salty']]

Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried , these by far are the best . They are close to the real thing as I recall . Sometimes they are difficult to obtain .

I love this coconut water - - it ' s naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water ( but not too much ) . My only " complaint " is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $ 22 - 23 on Amazon a few months ago , signing up for the regular delivery . Now , it is listed as " not available " for the regular delivery , but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $ 38 ( also a 12 - pack , same brand , same size per can ) .

Checked the ingredients and sure enough there was an extra ingredient called " natural flavors " in the packets of Z Sweet that is not in the larger bag version . I do not recommend this product - go with the " Wholesome Sweetness " brand of Erythritol since there is no other ingredient listed in their product .####[['NULL', 'food general', 'negative', 'disappointed'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'negative', 'after taste that tastes exactly like artificial sweeteners'], ['NULL', 'food recommendation', 'negative', 'do not recommend']]
We love this mix and use it to make a easy one pot meal from time to time . Just slice up your favorite Cajun sausage into coins , saute until browned , then add all the ingredients to the pan .

I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread .

I got this as a gift . I didn ' t think I ' d like it as I am not much of a coffee drinker . Mixed with a splash of skim milk and some artificial sweetener this was the best coffee I ' ve had in a long time ! we had been looking for King B brand jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened . They informed us that their Smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the King B products . With speculation on them keeping the same recipe , we orderd a jar and were not disappointed ! ! The product was exactly what we had remembered the original King B to be . I will definetly be ordering this again ! !####[['coffee', 'food general', 'positive', 'best']]

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . I ' m assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . Regardless , I would never purchase this product again because I don ' t want to risk my cats getting sick from it .

The normal metalic or plastic taste of bottled water is not present here ( at least I couldn ' t perceive it ) and the water is so smooth !

After being on the Atkins Diet for awhile , I decided to purchase Bob ' s Red Mill Organic Flaxseed Meal as a food supplement . I sprinkle it on top of my salads and when I make my meatballs , I use the flaxseeds instead of breadcrumbs .

If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . hese are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo .

A big downside for adults is that the blue / purple colors turn your tongue blue , and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush . he Haribo ' s don ' t have that side effect .

This is not a great green tea . It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion .

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end . So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over - preocessed .

My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender . Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the " sludge " ( from the brown rice ) with cold water . Then I warm it back up in the pan , usally adding some sour cream , butter , & salt / pepper to the sauce mix . As a former lover of all things gluten - containing , I have to say that when the rice pasta is rinsed , I think it ' s just as good if not better than traditional wheat pasta .

I really like tacos and Spanish rice . Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack , it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium .

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors . I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily .####[['Ambrosia Pure Honey', 'food quality', 'positive', 'delicious'], ['Ambrosia Pure Honey', 'food general', 'negative', 'comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use']]

I would recommend trying this flavor and this product in the store before buying . The planks are chewy enough that they taste kind of stale just as a granola bar or snack by themselves . I suppose if you were hiking and really hungry they might taste better , but I bought them for a snack when I work the midnight shift at work .

When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts ! It is really wonderful and my go - to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve ( sometimes several as I give them away ) .####[['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'smells so good'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'also tastes wonderful'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads'], ['NULL', 'food general', 'positive', 'really wonderful']]

My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products . It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations . My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement . Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided . I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions canned food and she loves it . Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed , this is working out much better . my friends and i really enjoy this . 4 minutes in a 700 microwave and almost all the kernals pop . nice flavor . not too much salt . 270 calories per beg . what more could you want .####[['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'food quality', 'positive', 'ear problems subsided'], ['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'food general', 'positive', 'loves'], ['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'food general', 'positive', 'working out much better']]
I ' ve tried these before individually , but this was the first opportunity I had to get them together . First , the food is relatively good quality for this kind of product , but I would say that it ' s more oily than what you ' d find in a restaurant ( and definitely moreso than homecooked ) and of course significantly higher in sodium . The taste , however , is reasonably good . Second , the price that I paid for these was very good ( I ended up getting a 20 % discount ) , and so from a value perspective I would say decently good food + good price = very good value .####[['product', 'food quality', 'positive', 'relatively good quality'], ['product', 'food quality', 'negative', 'more oily'], ['product', 'food quality', 'negative', 'significantly higher in sodium'], ['NULL', 'food quality', 'positive', 'reasonably good'], ['NULL', 'amazon prices', 'positive', 'price that I paid for these was very good'], ['NULL', 'amazon prices', 'positive', 'ended up getting a 20 % discount'], ['product', 'food general', 'positive', 'very good value']]
I bought the pack of 2 oz boxes which is really nice to have plenty on hand , to take hiking or to give to friends . I love the flavor and consistency of these chews but what ' s even better is that , when eaten after a meal , they really help with digestion . I have IBS so it seems like everything I eat has some negative effect but all that is mitigated by these chews . They reduce gas , bloating , and stomach pains . item was a good deal .

Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies . If you ' re going to give your child cookies , these are not so bad healthwise .

This brand is quite enjoyable ( once you know how to drink it e . g . sifting it , adding crystallized ginger ) - second time ordering product and actually missed it when I ran out . . .####[['green tea', 'food general', 'positive', 'enjoying'], ['green tea', 'food general', 'positive', 'quite enjoyable']]

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them . She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis . Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things . Since I am allergic to almost all medications , I have to find holistic ways to stay healthy . The tart cherry juice helps not only with arthritis but other things too . My body feels so much better when I use it every day .####[['cherry juice', 'food quality', 'positive', 'tart cherry juice helps'], ['cherry juice', 'food general', 'positive', 'feels so much better']]
I love having something in my desk that I can just dig into at lunch without even having to go stand in line for the microwave in the breakroom . But finding something really satisfying and tasty , and for under $ 3 , is amazing ! I ' ve always loved Bumblee Bee tuna anyway , and their tuna salad mix is fantastic . The peaches and cookie both taste great , and the whole thing makes for a really satisfying lunch . and perfect for at work .####[['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food general', 'positive', 'always loved'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food general', 'positive', 'tuna salad mix is fantastic'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food quality', 'positive', 'peaches and cookie both taste great'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food general', 'positive', 'really satisfying lunch'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food general', 'positive', 'perfect'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food general', 'positive', 'really satisfying'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food quality', 'positive', 'tasty'], ['Bumblee Bee tuna', 'food prices', 'positive', 'under $ 3 , is amazing']]

I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor . The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container , just paper . However , the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod , consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect . Alas , we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore .####[['Senseo coffee', 'food general', 'positive', 'easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor'], ['Senseo coffee', 'food general', 'positive', 'pods are much easier to composite']]

I bought this on a whim - trying other granola ' s that were sweet yet tasty . I like to mix granola with cranberries that are also very sweet .

We really liked this licorice when it was sold in the store . It was the same exact brand , but a different container . We ordered some online when the store didn ' t carry it anymore .

My only complaint about this product is that I couldn ' t get it in the 4 oz cups like some of the other fruits . I love Mandarin Oranges and the price on these is good - - this is one that would help me if it was in cups because I tend to eat too much of these sweet , juicy morsels !

This has been our favorite chili for years , and we ' ve tried many . We ' ve even thrown away a partial case of another brand bought at a big box store . We use it for chili dogs , in heated corn tortillas with cheese , or in a bowl with diced onions on top . The only kind we like better is my homemade chili , which isn ' t always conveniently sitting on a shelf , waiting to be heated for a quick meal . We always take a few cans when we go camping , and are never without Hormel Chili in our pantry .####[['Hormel Chili', 'food general', 'positive', 'favorite']]

This has a LOT of sugar in it . How about about matching the label with the product ? This is not " rich espresso mellowed by a touch of cream " .

I used to get these candies every day back in high school . Our German teacher would have them for sale . I bought a box from Amazon and was transported back to those days .

The bag was smaller than I expected , but that ' s probably just me being bad at estimating things . The salt seems good , however , I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are . I mean , they are pink , just not so bright pink as it shows . The salt has a good flavor though .
