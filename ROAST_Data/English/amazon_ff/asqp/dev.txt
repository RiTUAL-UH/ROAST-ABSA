My 14 month old loves these pouches and it ' s a great way of getting broccoli into her diet . she just started being able to do it herself recently , although it ' s sometimes messy . I just wish they were available in the larger size . 3 . 5 ounces is not a lot for a toddler - she can finish this in a minute and would want more .

Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father ' s lead ) , I ' ve never been an avid hot tea drinker .

I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar .

We recently adopted an obese pet and were looking for healthy dog food that could help him lose weight . The ingredients seemed great , but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5 - 7 times per day ! The food did little to help with weight reduction ( even with all the vomiting ) , and we eventually had to switch to a veterinarian - prescribed food instead . Note : Our dog does not have a hypothyroid problem . ) After we stopped feeding our dog this brand of dog food , his stool has become firmer and less frequent , and he is no longer vomiting on a daily basis .

We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2 - 3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed . From day one this worked great . Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me .

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good .

When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit , so I bought another box . The second box , not so much . I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me . The tea does not have a bad taste , doable for its purpose . Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes , vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer .

I first discovered Harney and Sons tea at a local , trendy gourmet shop . I have since sampled several of their teas and have found the Earl Grey and the Wedding Tea to be the best . The packaging is very attractive and when I finish the teas I use the empty tins to house my daughter ' s growing art supplies . This particular Earl Grey is flavorful and warming . One time I did purchase a H & S tin that was labeled " Special Earl Grey with Silver Tips " .

I have bought this particular xylitol gum but never questioned as to where it was made . If it is made in China , I give it zero stars because one has to be concerned about poisons they have found in many other things made in China like dog food , cat food , jewelry , tooth paste , baby formula , and more .

Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums , I was hoping they would be nice . But they taste pretty artificial , and the texture has no chew to it .

My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli , and it turned out quite good . Noodle strands were separate ( not mushy ) and taste wasn ' t any different from regular rice vermicelli . My wife mentioned that if the vermicelli was cooked exactly as instructed on the package , noodles would come out too dry and hard .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added .
