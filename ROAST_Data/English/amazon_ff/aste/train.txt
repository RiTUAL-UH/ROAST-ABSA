I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[['coffee beans', 'roast more of their coffee beans this way', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', 'right amount of roasting', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', 'taste is excellent', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', '" mostly " excellent', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', 'flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking', 'negative'], ['coffee beans', 'certainly a welcome addition to the cycle', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', 'giving it a 4 / 5', 'positive'], ['coffee beans', 'not a fan of their tendency to char - broil', 'negative']]

I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason : Kelloggs continues to include GMO ( genetically modified organism ) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels . There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption . Kelloggs / position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers . However , Michael Taylor , head of the FDA , is a former attorney for Monsanto , the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply , illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly . It ' s interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy .

The only thing I didn ' t care for is the bottle design because it is impossible to pour without it getting some product on the outside of the bottle , leaving a sticky mess .

These are hands down the best gummis I have ever tasted . It may take a minute to get used to the flavors , only because they are so authentically fruity , they don ' t taste like the overly sweet gummis you are probably used to , but they are definitely worth a try . These are different then the original German version of Goldbaren , these are the Saft ( translated as " juice " in English ) bears . The original Goldbaren are much more similar to the Gold Bears sold in the US . These taste more like actual fruit and come in different flavors : black currant , apple , lime , raspberry , pear , and peach .####[['gummis', 'hands down the best gummis', 'positive'], ['gummis', 'authentically fruity', 'positive'], ['gummis', 'definitely worth a try', 'positive'], ['gummis', 'taste more like actual fruit', 'positive'], ['gummis', 'come in different flavors', 'positive']]

This is a good idea in theory , especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks .

This is my favorite energy bar . Most of the time I prefer to eat real food , but there are occasions ( long hikes , motorcycle trips ) when it is more convenient to stash a small energy bar that is not damaged by extreme temperatures or being squished , and does not need anything else for preparation or clean up . I also will frequently throw one in my purse if I am going somewhere for the day like a fair or expo where I ' m not sure if there will be anything to eat besides hot dogs and nachos .

I personally loved every flavor in this bag , which my supermarket carried for only a limited time it seems . I really wish there were a way to still get these but not so many bags at once , but for these things I might just get it anyway - they are totally worth it . They are a perfect blend of delicious fruit taste and sour , they aren ' t SUPER sour so they won ' t melt you , but I probably wouldn ' t advise leaving them in the same spot in your mouth for a long time . I do this sometimes to see how long I can last , but moving it around solves any ' burn ' or anything immediately and is quite pleasurable spreading through the mouth .

Excellent , simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised . I consider it to be a medium roast / breakfast blend kind of coffee . If you are into heavy , dark roasts like French , Italian , or Sumatran , then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste . However , I love it . Unfortunately , the one - star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee . don ' t follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you ' ll get . i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this " soup " tolerable . i didn ' t fill it to the line , i filled it half way , and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles . not too bad , but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price . not even close .####[['Kenya AA', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['Kenya AA', 'not bitter', 'positive']]
If you like this kind of thing , then this is the brand for you .

I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon . My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico , One , then Vita Coco . Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said , I will pass on that . I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably . I would rate this behind One for taste . I like the convenience of having it in a can but the cans look somewhat dirty compared to ones normally used for soda .####[['coconut water', 'best tasting', 'positive'], ['coconut water', 'priced reasonably', 'positive']]

McCormick spices aren ' t exactly world - renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world . But Vanilla isn ' t a bold new taste sensation ; it ' s a , well , plain - vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity . A baker needs their extract to be consistent , flavorful , and ( unless you are made of money ) inexpensive . This is all three . This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch ; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle . You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it ' s the " default " brand of vanilla extract in the US , the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it , or something like it .####[['McCormick spices', 'flavorful', 'positive'], ['McCormick spices', 'inexpensive', 'positive']]

One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water . Those units can be very expensive , so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia ' s 9 . 5 pH water may be a good option . It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes , though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits . Since it comes in a plastic bottle you ' ll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn ' t make the water absorb plastic chemicals . If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option , though to be more eco - conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics .####[['Kangen', 'NULL', 'positive']]

While saving money is a key factor in purchasing this , I am basing my review on the taste of the product . Overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged K - cups .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels . Trying to find the right food so that I didn ' t have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy , but this Wellness Simple Solutions , along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job . If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach / bowel reactions , as any pediatrician will tell you , feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible , and only add ingredients as needed , after waiting for a time to watch for reactions . Simple Solutions is the way to do this , and for a dog with irritable bowels , it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food , instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog . The dogs love the taste , and Wellness brand is excellent quality .####[['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'love the taste', 'positive'], ['Wellness Simple Solutions', 'excellent quality', 'positive']]

I think this is a good powder for people who don ' t like stuff that is sweet - I couldn ' t really taste the vanilla or sweetness much at all , so for me this doesn ' t work as a standalone protein powder .

It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way .

This is seriously the best tasting protein drink I have had , hands down ( and I have tried a LOT of them ) . I can ' t recommend it enough .

We ' ve long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these . Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I ' m a confirmed salt - aholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans .

This is great stuff ! You can use in place of peanut butter in lots of ways and the calorie difference really helps the waistline !

I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast , nicely mannered , moderate taste to offer just about everyone . Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake - up . Good for an afternoon " Kaffeestunde " entertainment . But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker , oily , stronger flavor coffee bean . The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at .

I was pretty pleased when I tried this item after a recent food service show . There is a very strong chocolate smell and taste . One bar has 150 calories ( 30 from fat ) and 9 grams of sugar ( versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars ) .

Everytime I run out and get regular kibble or cans , my cats look scruffy and they seem to hate the store - bought stuff and hate me for feeding it to them . On this food for years , my cats are shiny , never gassy , never fat though I leave the food out all the time in a bistro feeder , and their poop ain ' t sweet but seems less foul than when on other food . Only down side is that you have to remember to reorder it 2 weeks before you run out because it ' s not in any stores . It ' s not cheap but with 2 cats a 40 pound bag ( $ 90 including shipping ) lasts me about 12 weeks , so under $ 4 a week per cat , maybe $ 2 more than Purina , $ 1 more than Iams and about the same as Blue or Nutro .####[['NULL', 'not cheap', 'negative']]

Unfortunately , even with sugar as ingredient # 1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient # 2 , Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose ( a sugar substitute , Splenda equivalent ) as a final ingredient .

This is by far ( in my opinion ) the best flavor of the Sweet Leaf line . The Vanilla is versatile and can be used for cooking , coffee , tea etc . The ONLY problem I have with the drops is it can be very hard to figure out exactly how much you need for something . I think a HUGE improvement to the product would be to have measuring lines on the dropper . Otherwise , you spend all this time counting out the drops because if you go OVERLY sweet . . bleck . . bitter city . excellent product . this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years . we use it almost every night . it is very quite , the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well . we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning . i would recommend this product####[['Sweet Leaf line', 'best flavor', 'positive'], ['Sweet Leaf line', 'recommend this product', 'positive']]

The retail price clearly marked on each package is $ 2 . 79 , so a case of 12 packages should retail for $ 33 . 48 plus shipping . Since the cost of this product is $ 47 . 95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages , make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D ' Oro before ordering .####[["Stella D ' Oro", 'quality is great', 'positive'], ['seller', 'NULL', 'negative']]

I got into Larabars , because I am trying to eat more natural , less packaged food . Yes Larabars come in a package , but they do not have any preservatives , chemicals , or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce . Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients .

My favorite flavors are Coconut ( SO YUMMY ) , Lemon ( tastes like a lemon square , very tart ) , and Banana ( tastes freakishly like banana bread ) .

For me , this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it . I had really been looking for ward to this , but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing . No matter how hard I tried , I could not get it to adequately mix with milk . Always a grainy , chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor . Sorry Nestle , but this product is definitely not for me . i purchased this product to kill algae and moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio . i used the product at four different intervals . the results were very poor , the same moss and algae are still there . i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle , it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals . i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it dave d####[['NULL', 'weak hot chocolate', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'absolutely do not reccomend', 'negative']]

The previous review , faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness , is accurate , and I was at first equally disappointed . But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice , much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it . This works ! I microwave a slice ( a little tough to cut , but I use a sharp knife and keep my fingers safe ) on high heat for about seven seconds . It softens , becomes easily chewed , and the flavor comes out fully . I ' ve become addicted !####[['Campofrio lomo', 'NULL', 'positive']]

This olive oil so far is great . I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet .

Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock . Ours was actually 15 + years old when we opened it , and it was deliciously smooth , with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel . Kick was in the mid - palette , clean finish . I was very impressed with how smooth this is - it makes Rare Breed seem cheap . I will say the flavor tended to trend towards bitter as it warmed up , so if you have a couple of whiskey stones , I would suggest using them to maintain the flavor while sipping . More than perhaps a single ice cube if you don ' t have stones would be a travesty - this is some really , really good bourbon .####[['whiskey stones', 'deliciously smooth', 'positive'], ['whiskey stones', 'warmth and great mouth feel', 'positive'], ['whiskey stones', 'smooth', 'positive']]

I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description . It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond , walnut and macadamia , especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list . Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills . It is a shame too , since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description .

These pops were absolutely awful . My first try was the German Chocolate Cake , which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy .

This real maple syrup is FANTASTIC ! I ' m confused though as to the benefits of it being Organic . I want to believe that it being organic makes it better quality , but it tastes the same as natural maple syrup . Neither has added ingredients , preservatives , or residual pesticides to my knowledge . So while I love this organic version , I will probably opt in the future for a cheaper natural alternative , unless someone gives me a good reason for sticking to the organic kind . it is a really great product . it helps me stick to my diet . just run water over the noodles and your good to go . you can put them in anything you want . definitely worth the try . they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making .####[['real maple syrup', 'FANTASTIC', 'positive'], ['real maple syrup', 'Organic', 'positive'], ['real maple syrup', 'NULL', 'negative']]

Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste . A hint of brown sugar coats each square , and it is exactly that - just a hint .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized .

If you ' re ever in the need for an exotic alternative , in your regular soup routine , then try Nile Spice soups . Nile Spice Lentil Curry Couscous soup is a light blend of curry , turmeric , and other East / West Indian spices . Although the soup lacks the punch of spiciness one would expect from a true Indian ( or Caribbean ) curry dish , the soup is still a delicious meal . As a person who is allergic to monosodium glumate ( MSG ) , I am glad to have found a brand of instant soup meals that does not contain this harmful food additive . The soup does have a slightly high sodium content percentage at 30 % ; however , most processed items containing sodium are within the same percentile .

We switched her to Canidae based on a friend ' s recommendation . She has gained half her weight back in 2 weeks and her coat is improving , as is her energy levels . For a siberian husky , this food can ' t be beat ! but unfortunately , it was , to me , really unpalatable . I ' m generally not picky when it comes to sugar substitutes - I get that nothing is going to match sugar exactly in taste . But oh boy , the luo han just doesn ' t do it for me . If you are ok with that sweetener , then you might just find this to be a great syrup . But , to others , I recommend you try luo han first before ordering .####[['Canidae', 'NULL', 'neutral']]
These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized . Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear " all natural no fake flavors " - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced - highly processed , sweetner from starch and a source of carbs . So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine I just wish they wouldn ' t try and pretend to be something they are not - they are snack food - we expect some downside####[['sweet potatoe chips', 'tasty', 'positive'], ['sweet potatoe chips', 'product is fine', 'positive']]

I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar - induced drinks , and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners , it tastes pretty good ! Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint . But the key is dumping some rum in there . Where I come from , a mojito isn ' t a mojito if it ' s not making you dizzy , and some rum will achieve that effect very nicely . Sure , the drink tastes fine without it , but this achieves new heights once you agree to spice it up . On a nice , hot day this drink is highly recommended .####[['Crystal Light products', 'tastes pretty good', 'positive'], ['Crystal Light products', 'highly recommended', 'positive']]

Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father ' s lead ) , I ' ve never been an avid hot tea drinker . I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea . Healthy or not , this tea is delicious . I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar .

I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola .

This is amazing salt ! A friend brought me my first bag from the Cook Islands . It is light and very nice on the tooth . I wish I could buy it in 5 lb bags .

It is a great finishing salt for meats too !####[['salt', 'amazing', 'positive'], ['salt', 'light', 'positive'], ['salt', 'very nice', 'positive'], ['salt', 'great', 'positive']]

The ingredients seemed great , but this food made our dog vomit daily and have very soft bowel movements 5 - 7 times per day !

My dog absolutely loves these tiny treats . The size of the bag is nice because the amount of treats lasts a long time . Coaxing her to get into the car was difficult until I remembered that these treats worked so well with training why not tempt her into the car with these too , voila after about 5 mins no problem . Now she doesn ' t need the treats to get in . They are a great reward after tedious brushing so she puts up with combing knowing she will get them .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

Kenco coffee is good not great . I have just recently bought a tassimo machine and have been trying out different coffee ' s and tea ' s .

I am not afraid of strong ginger flavor .

Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt ! I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts . This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet , in moderation . Why would anyone continue using the " white death " table salt that is void of so many essential elements ? I also use this to make an all - natural facial and body scrub ! We should only " feed " our skin what we would put in our mouths ! exactly what i wanted . looks great and have had many nice compliments on it .

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better . Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2 % milk is required even to get a child to drink them . My advice is to pick up an alternative brand ' s seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K - cup makers and skip this Green Mountain / Cafe Escapes variety - as these are disappointing at best . Avoid if possible , but not a total waste . Consider my 2 stars as " generous .

It ' s difficult to find Bob ' s Red Mill Light Spelt Flour in my area , so I have this product auto - shipped to my home , and use it just as I would wheat flour in most recipes . Spelt is a wonderful alternative for people who cannot tolerate wheat , although it doesn ' t work for anyone with celiac - sprue disease .

I placed the order based on the good reviews here . Generally speaking , I like it especially the texture . It contains the right amount of moisture , not to dry , not to moist . However , I do believe it contains too much almond extract . It ' s too dominant in the smell and in the taste . It ' s hard to miss once you open the plastic wrap of the bar . these beans came FAST ! not to mention as soon as i got the package ( packaged very well ) and opened it up . you could smell nothing but awesome vanilla aroma . inspecting the beans through the resealable plastic vaccume packed bag they appear to be long , plump and in good condition . cant wait to use these !####[['beans', 'like it especially the texture', 'positive'], ['beans', 'contains the right amount of moisture', 'positive'], ['beans', 'not to dry', 'positive'], ['beans', 'not to moist', 'positive'], ['beans', 'contains too much almond extract', 'negative'], ['beans', 'too dominant in the smell and in the taste', 'negative'], ['package', 'came FAST', 'positive'], ['package', 'packaged very well', 'positive'], ['beans', 'awesome vanilla aroma', 'positive'], ['package', 'resealable plastic vaccume packed bag', 'positive'], ['beans', 'long', 'positive'], ['beans', 'plump', 'positive'], ['beans', 'good condition', 'positive']]
I am a huge fan of PB2 and have been for years . PB2 isn ' t a perfect replacement for peanut butter  but it has a natural taste to it , is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile . I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product . When turning PB2 into peanut butter , don ' t add too much water , or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted .

I have been trialing various wheat flours to the end of building fine artisan sourdough bread .

This is a good , albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash . It is made from blended black teas . I much prefer Stash ' s Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash ' s Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes .

Have two Shi Tzus that will puke up anything that isn ' t in a very specific range and one of the dogs gets a very acid stomach , so we have to constantly give her small treats to keep the acid down . These treats work great and don ' t upset their stomachs . The dogs never have a problem with them and they like them .

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth .

We kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn ' t eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time .

I say this as I have tried some where the bean is like eating bark or some have so much chocolate covering them you can barely find the bean so you feel sick before you get the desired pick me up from the caffeine , so this is a refreshing change as the bean to choco ratio is perfect . . hese are pretty spendy but in the long run well worth it since you only need a couple beans to perk you up vs the other brands that are out there . . will be buying again : )####[['choco covered espresso beans', 'far superior', 'positive'], ['espresso bean', 'less calories', 'positive'], ['espresso bean', 'more caffeine', 'positive'], ['espresso bean', 'perfect', 'positive'], ['espresso bean', 'pretty spendy', 'negative'], ['choco covered espresso beans', 'again', 'positive'], ['choco covered espresso beans', 'small amount of dark chocolate', 'positive'], ['espresso bean', 'great taste', 'positive']]

If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies , and have grown up eating that style of gummy , you will probably be disappointed with these . hese are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands , as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo .

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen . The flavors are crisp and balanced , not too veggie - heavy nor too sharp , just the right balance and thickness . And they are almost complete - - you just add milk , or water , and more ingredients if you happen to have them - - bell peppers , for instance - - and you have a full - fledged soup . The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end .

I started drinking Goji juice a few months ago , per the request of an acupuncturist , and ever since I tried it , I ' ve been hooked .

Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat . My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food .

If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time . I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description . Besides the flavor , this brand goes the proverbial extra mile in being earth friendly . The packet describes the treatment of the workers and plants as well as states that part of the proceeds go to an organization started by this brand - - - Kicks For Causes - - which assists in the development of youth soccer programs . As stated on the package " the proper place for a child is on the playground , not in the workplace " .

I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything . My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat , hand pressing the liquids , then boil the water out .

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors .

When you first open a jar , you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good ! It also tastes wonderful ! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads . I suggest that after you use a little bit , to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix . I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts !

I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication . I am not sure it helps him that much at all , but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it . Which is good , because my insomnia was driving me absolutely nuts ! I have to get more 100 % cranberry juice , because I prefer this mixed in with juice than I do with water .####[['NULL', 'help me calm down', 'positive'], ['NULL', 'good', 'positive']]
I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing ! So thick and creamy , especially if you make it with a little milk !

As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers . I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot . This was a dissapointment .

I was truly disappointed . If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this . There is nothing Chai about this product . Now I find out that this product is not eligible for return .

I have three cats , and was having trouble finding a dry cat food that all three would eat in between canned food feedings , so I decided to give this one a try . They all three love this food , and it is pretty nutritious for them , and no animal by - products .

If you love coconut , then this is for you . As a bona fide coco - ' nut ' , I can tell you this product is delicious . crispy and lightly sweet wide flakes .

Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid . I thought it was just ok . A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me . It ' s pretty much the same as Coffee People ' s Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call I can ' t tell the three apart .

Recieved the package on time , but there was a glitch with the order . I hadn ' t recieved the cat food I had ordered .

I bought this product , remembering the sweet almond taste of the Orzata beverage . To my surprise , the sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough to make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet . Compare the ingredients in Ferrara Almond Orzatata Syrup to the ingredients of Monin Almond Syrup , and the difference is obvious . Ferrara : sugar , water , almond extract , citric acid , artificial color , 1 / 10th of 1 % sodium benzoate ( as preservative ) Monin : Pure cane sugar , water , natural almond flavorI rest my case .####[['Monin Almond Syrup', 'sour taste of the added citric acid was strong enough', 'negative'], ['Monin Almond Syrup', 'make the overall flavor tart instead of sweet', 'negative']]

Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label . The dosage amount of Glucosamine / Chondroitin is vague . It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine . Too expensive for me .

When I was growing up my German - French mother would tell me stories about how , when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis , her French grandmother would take cherry stems , boil them all day long , and make a syrup out of them . She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis . Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things .

I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor . The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container , just paper . However , the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod , consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect .
