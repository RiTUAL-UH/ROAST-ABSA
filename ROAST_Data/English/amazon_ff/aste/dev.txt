My 14 month old loves these pouches and it ' s a great way of getting broccoli into her diet . she just started being able to do it herself recently , although it ' s sometimes messy .

Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth ( following my father ' s lead ) , I ' ve never been an avid hot tea drinker . I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea . Healthy or not , this tea is delicious . I drink at least two cups a day , plus a Thermos - ful at work . I prefer it with a shot of Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar .

I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo - peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola .

Simply Fiber ' s taste ( or lack of taste ) is one of its strengths , in my opinion . I have it with fruit , cinnamon , and powdered stevia for breakfast .

The cinnamon variety tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar kind of oatmeal squares to me . Somtimes I do hit a square that is more cinnamony than the rest , but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed with these considering how much I enjoy the blue box kind . Maybe it was the milk , but I have tried these on their own too and find that they ' re kind of short on flavor . I still like these Quaker Oatmeal Squares and they ' re still great for just about any time of day . Still crispy inside even if the outside ' s a little soggy and still good for you too , just not my favorite .####[['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'tastes almost exactly the same as the hint of brown sugar', 'positive'], ['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'more cinnamony than the res', 'negative'], ['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'little underwhelmed', 'negative'], ['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'kind of short on flavor', 'negative'], ['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'still great', 'positive'], ['Quaker Oatmeal Squares', 'Still crispy inside', 'positive']]

Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors . They are addictive , and it ' s hard to imagine eating popcorn without them . One problem is that they don ' t do well in humidity , turning into a solid mass . That fact will make it hard to buy a six - pack from here .

We use hemp seeds , hemp protein powder , chia seeds or walnuts every day for extra Omega 3 ' s in our diet . I tried the Nutiva hemp seeds once and like them enough that I see no reason to try another brand and Amazon has the best price of the places I compared . One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie .

As you can see from the title , that it is is a must . I just add it to all savory dishes . It adds a depth . It is not available in supermarkets . Since the price is right and with free shipping and handling , I save myself a trip to a specialty shop . I love pimenton and I love Amazon .####[['shipping', 'free', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'price is right', 'positive'], ['pimenton', 'love', 'positive']]
I ' ve been very surprised how much I enjoyed the combination of mint and green tea . This tea is a very nice balance between mellow mint flavor and mellow green tea flavor .

Great cereal that for some reason is unavailable in any grocery stores in our area ! Kelloggs has not been helpful when I question them about why ! So I was very excited when I found it on Amazon !

I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts . These are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful . The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans . There are barely any pecans , but tons of cashews . Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there .####[['brazil nuts', 'recommend not buying', 'negative'], ['brazil nuts', 'just average quality', 'negative'], ['brazil nuts', 'taste just plain awful', 'negative'], ['brazil nuts', 'barely any pecans , but tons of cashews', 'negative'], ['brazil nuts', 'good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans', 'positive']]
Sometimes more is NOT better . In this instance , however , double the bergamot IS FAR superior to regular Earl Grey tea .

My picky friends and I all agree that this is close to the ultimate in chocolate . BUT . . . . . . at the current ( 9 April 2010 ) tarriff of $ 7 . 99 for ONE BAR ( plus shipping on orders uder $ 25 ) , we ' ll continue buying it at local supermarkets ( and even at the store everyone loves to hate ) for $ 2 . 18 or a bit more ; sometimes less on sale . Amazon , I ADORE you - - you often have excellent prices , your web site is the best , and nothing has ever gone awry with anything from you , so I buy lots of food here in addition to DVDs , CDs , techie toys , clothes , garden & kitchen stuff , and , yes , books , but surely you can find a more reasonably - priced source !####[['Amazon', 'excellent prices', 'positive'], ['Amazon', 'current ( 9 April 2010 ) tarriff of $ 7 . 99 for ONE BAR', 'negative'], ['shipping', 'NULL', 'negative'], ['chocolate', 'close to the ultimate', 'positive']]
David Rio Flamingo Sugar Free Chai Tea Latte is so delicious and creamy , all you need to do is add water . No milk is needed ! It tastes just as you imagine a creamy vanilla chai latte should . . .

I am a regular subscriber of this " Jack Link ' s " beef jerky terriyaki . This morning , I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10 .

These bars are great ! I like so many of the different flavors . It is hard to find a soy - free and dairy - free bar with some protein , so it was great to find these .

These SmartFries are so awsome ! With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving , but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories . I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20 . If any of you love the Trader Joe ' s Skinny Fries , then you ' re in luck because these are the same thing and the same price if purchased in multiple bag packs .

With so many Green Tea powders on Amazon , I mostly rely on the customer comments . This tea is exactly what I was looking for and the price was reasonable compared to others .

Dude , they ' re Reese ' s Cups . If you need to read a review that probably means you ' ve never had one .

I bought this because it was on sale and hey we ' re in a recession , right ? I thought it was too sweet . Maybe it is my adult tastebuds . Tastes a lot like good ol ' cinnamon toast crunch .

I have sampled many bulk Chai teas and I have to say this is the BEST one ever . It is very authentic and hits a lot of flavor notes . Perfectly balanced spices with a hint of heat from black pepper . Keep in mind it is a process to brew , so give yourself about 10 + minutes from start to finish . Use 1 3 / 4 teaspoons per serving and sweeten with honey to enhance the flavors .####[['Chai teas', 'BEST one ever', 'positive'], ['Chai teas', 'very authentic', 'positive'], ['Chai teas', 'hits a lot of flavor notes', 'positive'], ['Chai teas', 'Perfectly balanced spices', 'positive']]
We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food . Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we ' ve had them on . It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for ! When Amazon upped the price $ 10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals , but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen , but that awful smelling gas came back as well ! ! We are putting them back on Canidae .

This is good coffee . I think it is just short of 5 - start rating . The boldness and dark roast is tempered by the lighter roast . Bold coffee drinkers could probably make it stronger and enjoy a bold taste due to the fine grinding . I don ' t think any coffee drinkers will be displeased with this roast .

I eat a teaspoon of coconut oil at night to maintain regularity . I ' ve also found that certain foods taste better when cooking in coconut oil .

I always make sure I ' m stocked with these bones to occupy my dog for at least 30 - 60 minutes at a time . He chews the same bone for 2 or 3 days . He satisfies his chewing instinct and stays away from my boyfriend ' s shoes .
