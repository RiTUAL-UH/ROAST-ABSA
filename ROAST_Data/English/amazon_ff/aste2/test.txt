Its really pretty good ! I found this is a pretty handy addition to many menu items , and a great alternative to basic taco sauce or salsa all the time .

My dog loves these . The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows . Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs . Greenies . The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage . slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices .####[([37], [39, 40], 'POS')]
We get Nutiva Organic EV coconut oil on a two month subscription . It ' s great . I like to mix a serving of pistachios , a serving of almonds , and a tbsp of oil together for a late evening treat .

This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely . When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha , I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy , like nutmeg and cloves . It wasn ' t unpleasant , just totally unexpected . The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste , where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty , rich pistachio flavor . The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor , and I can ' t help but wonder if the spiciness isn ' t at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground . Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink !####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([4], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([4], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([4], [42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS'), ([4], [47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([4], [52, 53, 54], 'POS'), ([4], [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'POS'), ([4], [66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'NEU'), ([4], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80], 'POS'), ([4], [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90], 'POS'), ([4], [126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132], 'POS'), ([4], [137, 138, 139], 'POS')]

I first had Tim Hortons when visiting Niagra Falls in Canada . I couldn ' t believe how great it tasted . I had to try the shipped coffee to see if it was as good . This is the best home brewed pot of coffee I have made .####[([3, 4], [17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS')]
My cats love this cat food . They enjoy the shredded meat and chunks of potatoes and vegetables . This is a great supplement to commercial wet food , which I use when higher quality cat food is not available . UPDATE : I think they have changed some of their recipes . My cats used to love the Steak Frites , but they don ' t like the new version at all . I still think the food is good and very high quality , though .####[([4, 5], [2], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [57, 58, 59, 60], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 'NEG'), ([4, 5], [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [82, 83, 84, 85, 86], 'POS')]
The oil itself is fine , but I have a problem with how the bottle is designed . Small amounts of oil accumulate on the wide metal area surrounding the cap , and fruit flies and other small insects will drown themselves in it . Then , if you ' re not careful , you ' ll pour dead bugs into your food ! Not cool . I would really prefer a differently - shaped bottle .####[([1], [4], 'POS')]
