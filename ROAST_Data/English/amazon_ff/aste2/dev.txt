Great tasting organic product ! I have been on a somewhat organic diet since I was a child . My parents always had an organic garden and now I have one . My son also loves organic food and this was a great alterative to regular store brands . Adding organic sour cream or extra cheese to it just enhances the taste .

I grabbed a variety of various protein / energy bars , including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt .

Expected this gluten - free mix to be somewhat similar to regular angel food cake mixes in that only water and vanilla would need to be added .

The aroma was amazing but it just tasted like regular coffee . The coffee was good , it just did not have the flavor I was expecting . Also this was a present for my dad and the way it was packaged the bag got two holes in it . Luckily only a small amount of coffee grounds were lost and I was able to patch the bag with tape . Although my dad felt obligated to use this coffee up as quickly as possible because he was worried the holes would effect how long it stayed fresh which is not how I would want him to feel about his present .####[([10], [1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([10], [6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEU'), ([10], [15], 'POS'), ([10], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG')]
Although I have enjoy the Silver Needle Tea from this company immensely I was very disappointed with this tea .

One serving is 3 tablespoons which is quite a lot , so keep that in mind when figuring cost per serving and when comparing various high Omega 3 products . We use them sprinkled on top of salads or cooked veggies or sometimes I put them in my VitaMix machine along with extra firm tofu to blend them into a smooth paste as the base for a huge mixed fruit breakfast milkshake / smoothie . They are a very good way to add not only Omega 3 ' s but extra protein to a meal and although the taste is very mild , they are quite good . Do keep the package in the refrigerator after it is opened .####[([46], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30], [33, 34, 35], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30], [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30], [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30], [155, 156, 157, 158], 'POS'), ([28, 29, 30], [162, 163], 'POS')]
Another reviewer gave this product a one star rating because of delivery problems . Amazon stands behind it ' s customers and would have quickly replaced the damage creamers or refunded her money .

The flavor of CALM is great and the children love it too . Prefer liquid supplements and because of strenuous workouts , needed to take calcium magnesium supplements .

These biscuits ( cereal ) are about as true to natural as you can get . No added sugars or sodium or anything else .

This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe . it ' s artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it .

This is delicious jerky . It ' s high in protein , softer and chewier than other brands , and it ' s relatively low in sodium for a jerky . It ' s easy to pack for snacks or lunches .

100 % Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers . This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes . The pods work well , as intended , and the company certainly tries to spread around the positivity . The individual foil packets keeps each pod fresh and ready to use . I have since tried several of their different coffees , and yet this remains my favorite ! litly carbonated yet sweet not to sweet it does really taste like lime and it is a very good soda i love limes and 7up and ramune a japenese soda . if you like any of those u will love this stuff but dont buy it on amazon buy it at smith which sels them for 89 . c you have to use a bottle opener to open them enjoy####[([23], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([23], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35], 'POS'), ([23], [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], 'POS'), ([23], [65, 66, 67], 'POS'), ([23], [82, 83, 84], 'POS')]

When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit , so I bought another box . The second box , not so much . I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me . The tea does not have a bad taste , doable for its purpose . Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes , vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer .

I loved every flavor of tea in this assortment , except for the mango passionfruit . The green tea with jasmine , peach tea , and English breakfast were especially good .

The packaging is great for a gift . The teabags are pyramidal in shape . As far as taste , if you ' re just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla , then this Tazo brand will do it for you . If you ' re looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste , then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea , Tazo , will disappoint you . The raw rooibos taste , without these " improvements " such as vanilla , is full - bodied and has its own unique taste . I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings , Republic of Tea , and Numi .####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS'), ([36], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 'POS'), ([36], [74], 'NEG'), ([36], [98, 99, 100], 'POS')]
This is by far the best GF sandwich bread I ' ve tried yet , Whole Foods makes a good one as well but for the price GF Pantry is much better . It actually tasted like white bread .
