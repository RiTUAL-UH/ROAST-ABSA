I ' m still disappointed with the " lower sodium " label . f course you will get less sodium if you decrease the amount in the cup by 50 % ! he large Mc Dougall soup cups contain two servings typically - have you tried to share one or keep it for another day ?

I wish Starbucks would roast more of their coffee beans this way . I am not a fan of their tendency to char - broil their coffee beans . For my taste , this is the right amount of roasting and the taste is excellent . I said " mostly " excellent in the title because like many vanilla flavored coffees , the flavor can become cloying after a while of prolonged drinking . For this reason I try to cycle through flavors , and this is certainly a welcome addition to the cycle . If you are a vanilla flavor fan you will probably rate this as a 5 / 5 , but I am giving it a 4 / 5 because I would like to reserve a perfect rating for truly exceptional blends .####[([26, 27], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [36, 37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [42, 43, 44], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [48, 49, 50, 51], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], 'NEG'), ([26, 27], [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG')]

If you ' re looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea , it ' s probably not a good idea for you to purchase this ( especially 6 boxes of it ) .

The flavor is very rich , but cripes is it potent . You only use about 1 / 3 the quantity to get the same strength . The flavor is somewhat like chocolate , not bitter at all .

We have three dogs - a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear , and two large dogs with health issues : a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer , who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago , and an 8 year old collie mix who has irritable bowels .

If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt ' s , the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has .

I just finished this coffee which was fine if you like a medium dark roast , nicely mannered , moderate taste to offer just about everyone . Good choice as a coffee nobody will dislike yet not a flavor for those who like a really strong wake - up . Good for an afternoon " Kaffeestunde " entertainment . But I am not likely to reorder it since I like the much darker , oily , stronger flavor coffee bean . The parrot picture on the bag is nice too to look at .

Maybe they think that people can ' t tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts ? I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK , but I have a hard time believing that the 4 . 5 star rating the product currently receives hasn ' t been created by company shills .

I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers . Now I ' m using my k - machine nearly every day again and loving it .

These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the " all natural nothing fake of phony " as advertized .

Sardines sometimes have a bad reputation because the cheaper ones are smelly and covered in tomato sauce or mustard .

They furnish a high protein content as well as potassium , and are a good source of Omega - 3 .

All ginger teas will have that bit of harshness that defines ginger , but this ginger tea smacked of unnatural harshness & bitterness that seems to only be capable of having been produced from the use of some mutant low quality ginger ( if real ginger at all ) . It left my mouth way too dry and no matter how far I thinned it out with more water or mixed with other liquids , the awful bitterness / dryness powered through . Looking for a balanced , smooth , nicely flavored ginger tea ? This is not it . ordered this for a gift , mostly . ordered four bags . ate one and sent the other three as a gift . this candy is very tasty and good sized pieces . does stick to your teeth a bit , but overall i would give it a thumbs up .####[([24, 25], [28, 29], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], [31], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], 'NEG'), ([24, 25], [85, 86, 87, 88], 'NEG')]

Palatable for kids but that ' s about the best I can say about them . On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates , but at the cost per cup for these should be much better .

Because this flour does contain some of the whole grain , the products I bake with it are a little darker in color and slightly coarser in texture than something that is made with all - purpose white wheat flour , but we haven ' t found the differences to be objectionable . I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good alternative to wheat flour .####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [46], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [123], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [93, 94, 95, 96], 'NEU'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [88, 89, 90, 91], 'NEU'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67], 'NEG')]

Although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth .

Actually , I couldn ' t make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients , and a fully - stocked kitchen .

The Comida Loca soups are not " open and serve soups " nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients - - they are ALMOST complete from the container , and you add a little bit ( milk , corn chips , etc ) at the end .

Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and , unlike most honey available at the grocery store , this honey is produced in the USA . My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use . The main drawback is that there ' s nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle . If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle ' s nozzle , you need to make a hole in it yourself . This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can ' t really be cut with scissors .

I will not make a point to buy these chips if alternatives are available at similar comparable prices . The best chip currently available is the Lant Chips on your Amazon . com site . Original LantChips , Salted , 1 . 5 - Ounce Bag , ( Pack of 28 )####[([59, 60], [53], 'POS'), ([63], [55, 56], 'POS'), ([3, 4], [12, 13, 14, 15], 'POS')]
My husband is an avid coffee drinker . Our son presented him with a Kuerig Brewer for his birthday . That was two years ago . Since that time he has been experimenting with various " flavors " of the K - Cups . This Nantucket Blend has become another " favorite " of his . Thanks for making it so easy to order and receive from Amazon . .####[([45, 46], [51], 'POS')]
If one attempts to rationlize this selection as I do , you conclude that the jalapeno in the jar is one expensive pepper , albeit beautiful , since it displaces one of the seven fillets of truly delectable yellowfin tuna . Stated differently , it is a one dollar jalapeno . However , less is more here because the flavor that results from steeping the tuna in that pepper and in the top quality olive oil is incomparable . Worth every penny . An awesome delicacy .####[([15, 16, 17, 18], [79, 80, 81], 'POS'), ([15, 16, 17, 18], [84, 85], 'POS'), ([15, 16, 17, 18], [77], 'POS'), ([15, 16, 17, 18], [21], 'NEG')]
I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs . He loves it and , in my view , it is a very healthy dog formula . I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein . My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select . I rate this product 5 stars .####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [20], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [31, 32, 33, 34], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [80, 81, 82, 83], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'POS')]
I love this smaller size coffee can 3 cans equal one large container and it ' s cheaper than you can buy it in the grocery stores . I go through a can a week which is perfect because the coffee is fresh until the end - unlike the bigger containers which would taste stale after not even 2 weeks of being opened . And since I use the subscribe & save feature for this , I don ' t even have to put coffee on my shopping list anymore . Love it !####[([5], [1], 'POS'), ([5], [3, 4], 'NEG'), ([5], [37], 'POS'), ([5], [42], 'POS'), ([5], [91], 'POS')]
