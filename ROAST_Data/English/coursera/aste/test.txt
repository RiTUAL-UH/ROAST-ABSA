Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer . One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1 - 3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues .

I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning . The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments ; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it , what I ' m doing wrong , or sometimes I don ' t even know what the question wants me to do .

Thank you for the course ! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting . Besides , it is really stimulating in terms of self - learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly .

In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education . In this course , students become members of a lively learning community that is always on .

A bit of a mess . If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups , you will be disappointed .

When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great .

This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course', 'great', 'positive'], ['instructor', 'lack of support', 'negative'], ['grading', 'lack of support', 'negative'], ['course', '3 out of 5', 'neutral'], ['Coursera', 'NULL', 'neutral'], ['course', 'moves quickly through concepts', 'negative'], ['discussion board', 'lack of support', 'negative']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses .

When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? !

The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition . The graphics and didactic material is very good . I would suggest that Dr .

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['video', 'given non - programmers a better starting point', 'positive'], ['video', 'ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos', 'negative'], ['video', 'jumps into some very advanced topics', 'positive'], ['mentors', 'no concept of what is critical content for beginners', 'negative']]

The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created . I did learn a bit of high level concepts , but when it comes to coding , the answers is always ' conveniently , my software does this for you ' . I wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper , and implement them . I also was able to complete this 6 week paid course in a few days which should not be possible . I have since started the free Stanford course taught by a co - founder of coursera , and it is MUCH better ! I recommend it to anyone !####[['course', 'basically an advertisement', 'negative'], ['course', 'learn a bit of high level concepts', 'positive'], ['course', 'should not be possible', 'negative']]
Wonderful lectures and good assignments . Very , very clear presentations . Minor drawbacks : there ' s no assistance available for the assignments ( which can be quite difficult ) .

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course', 'Excellent', 'positive'], ['Andrew Ng', 'valuable instruction', 'positive'], ['Andrew Ng', 'gives lot of advise', 'positive'], ['material', 'excellent foundations', 'neutral'], ['course', 'great place to start', 'positive']]
Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[['lectures', 'Short', 'positive'], ['notes', 'good', 'positive'], ['assignments and quiz', 'ensure you understand the material very well', 'positive'], ['assignments and quiz', 'more difficult than part 1', 'positive'], ['Python', 'still found everything very easy to digest and understand', 'positive'], ['Python', 'definitely recommend', 'positive'], ['Python', 'very challenging', 'positive']]
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .####[['Professor', 'reading his notes very quickly', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'very little time spent explaining complex topics', 'negative'], ['quizzes', 'emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'not seem to be anyone monitoring', 'negative'], ['forum', 'not answered or replied to by anyone', 'negative'], ['quizzes', 'mistakes in quiz questions', 'negative'], ['course', 'unfortunately impossible to absorb', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'no way to interact with anyone to get help', 'negative'], ['course', 'disappointing as a learning experience', 'negative']]

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .####[['course', 'give good intuitions', 'positive'], ['course', 'rating it 3 / 5', 'neutral'], ['course', 'SO confusing', 'negative'], ['course', 'mathematical notation is all over the place', 'negative'], ['course', 'still recommend', 'positive']]

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded .

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience .

Excellent ! I loved the course . I learned a LOT . The professors are incredible .

Good course . Personally I think it is almost the perfect level for those who have some basic understandings about finance and look forward to go deep ( such as me ) .

Some parts are needed more clarification . In other words , as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials , since the materials are not self - sufficient . Specially about simulation methods . However , this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5 . The absence of any help from TAs , based on my experience , is the reason . I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course .####[['course', 'Some parts are needed more clarification', 'negative'], ['materials', 'not self - sufficient', 'negative'], ['course', '4 out of 5', 'positive'], ['TAs', 'absence of any help', 'negative'], ['TAs', 'expected some official replies to my question', 'negative']]

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !####[['course', 'nicely organised', 'positive'], ['peer review assignment', 'bit of tweaking', 'neutral']]
The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined .

I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues .

The lectures are a very brief overview of topics , with nothing actually taught .

Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !####[['peer assessments', 'potentially interesting', 'positive'], ['peer assessments', 'majority are so trivial', 'negative'], ['material', '3 or 4 sentences repeating', 'negative'], ['material', 'hardly worth reading', 'negative'], ['grading', 'no real qualitative assessment', 'negative'], ['instructor', 'unbelievably upbeat and animated', 'positive'], ['courses', 'boring old sod', 'negative']]
I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly .

I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance .

I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects .

This course feels a lot like it ' s being taught by a non - teaching professor . The lectures are very long , not chunked for easy viewing ( to the point where I couldn ' t download to my phone for offline / off - wifi use ) . There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to " Selections " without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book .

A lot of material is presented here which is both good and bad .

Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching .

The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that .

The videos for this course seemed to be 30 % recap of the prior lesson , and 20 % restatement of what was learned . Some even duplicated their own content in the restatement . The material covered was simply running through each of the menus in Tableau . Again , this material may be of use , but would be better as a primer for the class rather than presented as useful , paid content .

First time taking a programming course . I was able to understand the basic concepts of python codding and I am looking forward to the next course Python Data Structures .

A brief but interesting introduction to HTML .

Nice course , hometasks are about medium level difficulty ( in hackerrank terms ) . Problems are already half - completed , so you ' re just filling the gaps following the design .

Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site !

There is absolutely no supervision on this course . My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so , no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as ' late submission ' .

I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help .

Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[['Professor', 'soft , easy to follow teaching style', 'positive'], ['course', 'structure has several pitfalls', 'negative'], ['course', 'too theoretical in week 3 and 4', 'negative'], ['assignment', 'only a quiz', 'negative'], ['course', 'hard to understand the core matters', 'negative'], ['assignment', 'takes a lot of time to learn free', 'negative']]

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts " triangular theory of love " and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .####[['course', 'good', 'positive'], ['contents', 'very helpful', 'positive'], ['contents', 'important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation', 'positive'], ['contents', 'goes on with a free and open discussion', 'positive'], ['lecturer', "doesn ' t even explain why", 'negative']]

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces .

Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it . So for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all . Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like " Eat3D " and many others out there , which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here !

Very poor teaching . Extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested , and what is not . They assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught .

Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge .

Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr .

Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months .

This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste .

I have enjoyed every second of the five - part creative writing specialization . These courses have made me reassess my writing practices , they have allowed me to hone my skills as both a writer and working on the editing process . The course materials were brilliantly developed to support the aspiring writer and the knowledge and writing tips are of a very high caliber . Each guest writer and tutor have given great insight into the writing process and how every writer is different , everybody has their own methods of working .

The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents .

The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to . A couple of math notations were also incorrect , for example " < " when the professor said " less than or equal to " . Overall though , I ' m pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study . excellent course ! they teach you all the terms and sentences you need to know either as a beginner learning Korean or if you ' re planning to travel there .

This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented .

Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it .

The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz .

For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !####[['lectures', 'Great', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'nicely explained', 'positive'], ['lecturers', 'address us directly', 'negative'], ['lecturers', 'enage us more to interact with the content', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'topics very simple', 'positive']]
Professor Ng has layed out this course very well , I ' m impressed at what I was able to learn in a few weeks ! The subject matter was engaging , and even the math was easy to follow with the professor ' s explanations . I ' m very happy I took this course as this is a subject in which I ' ve always been interested , and I ' m confident I can use what I ' ve learned in real world applications .####[['Professor Ng', 'layed out this course very well', 'positive'], ['course', 'impressed', 'positive'], ['course', 'subject matter was engaging', 'positive'], ['course', 'even the math was easy to follow', 'positive'], ['course', 'very happy', 'positive']]
