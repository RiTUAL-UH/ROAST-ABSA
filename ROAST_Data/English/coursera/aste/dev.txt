I am so glad to have found this course ! ! I had taken a course on MOS transistor operation during grad school , and never quite felt comfortable with the material , since not much time was spent discussing how the relevant mosfet equations came about . Professor Tsividis ' s discourse is like a breath of fresh air . They are so lucid that I feel I understand the material better now . The course is well structured ; as I go through it systematically , I can see how one lesson connects to the concepts presented in a previous one . Thank you so much , Dr . Tsividis for sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge about this topic .####[['course', 'so glad', 'positive'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'discourse is like a breath of fresh air', 'positive'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'so lucid', 'positive'], ['course', 'well structured', 'positive'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'Thank you so much', 'positive'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'understand the material better', 'positive']]

I enjoyed this course and recommend it . Prof . Fowler is very didatic and funny , and makes the classes nice to watch . I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given , and the support is not that perfection yet , but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance ( in my case , I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard . . . they were true mentors ) .

Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[['course', 'not as a standalone', 'negative'], ['course', 'developed solely for the specialisation', 'positive'], ['course', 'not learn much concepts or theories or practice', 'negative'], ['course', 'basic', 'positive'], ['course', 'good enough', 'positive'], ['video lectures', 'helpful', 'positive'], ['video lectures', 'very basic', 'positive']]
This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students .

Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[['course', 'Interesting', 'positive'], ['course', 'thought provoking', 'positive'], ['peer assignment tasks', 'very hard to hit', 'negative'], ['presentation', 'not totally agreed', 'negative'], ['presentation', 'nothing new', 'negative']]
Awesome class . It was very accessible and had some great examples . I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students .

This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on - line . Prof . Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work . I get the feeling this is quite a new course ( compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization ) and does not have the student interaction base yet .

I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr . Fredrickson refers to are for the most part only touched on briefly ) , and to have spent less time listening to the on - site students discussing their personal opinions ( though I appreciated their insights , I would have liked to have learned more actual information ) .

I learned a lot , enjoyed the lectures , and can see the application of what I learned outside the virtual classroom .

I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy . I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson ( reading - > video ) and the entire course . I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing each case . Perhaps , an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in - video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos . However , where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section . There was no authority answering any questions whatsoever , not content related nor operational .####[['course', 'fantastic introduction', 'positive'], ['video', 'especially enjoyed the structure', 'positive'], ['Prof', 'did a great job', 'positive'], ['Prof', 'enthusiastic', 'positive'], ['Prof', 'mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing', 'positive'], ['course', 'no authority answering any questions', 'negative'], ['discussion section', 'NULL', 'neutral'], ['in - video question', 'ask more', 'neutral']]
After being bored to death by his first highly complex and involved analytical / historical lectures , I skipped over every video that Prof . Germano lectured in .

Germano ' s lectures were not needed for the graded quizzes .####[['Prof .

This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments . I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the ins and outs of citations , which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course . I tend to get lazy and cute incorrectly because I never had the chance to learn how to do it in school . This professor is very understanding and straight to the point .

I thoroughly enjoyed this course . It was a narrowly - defined topic ( Questionnaire Design ) that was well - explored ; this makes the course feel like you are actually learning something and does not feel overwhelming in the slightest .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise .

The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[['course', 'well thought', 'positive'], ['course', 'basic', 'positive'], ['course', 'very easy to follow and finish', 'positive'], ['Quizzes', 'alternating between very good and very bad', 'neutral'], ['peer grading', "doesn ' t make for a good use", 'negative'], ['videos', 'made with an indecent knowledge of the technology', 'negative'], ['videos', 'green screens were used so badly', 'negative'], ['slides', 'cut away and put back', 'negative'], ['slides', 'downright infuriating', 'negative'], ['course', 'very good opening', 'positive'], ['course', 'needs serious improvement', 'negative'], ['course', 'masterfully set of lessons', 'positive']]
The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected . For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria . The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous . There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over .####[['course', 'valuable', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'poorly integrated', 'negative'], ['quizes', 'poorly tied to the lecture material', 'negative'], ['quizes', 'ambiguous', 'negative'], ['quizes', 'single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over', 'negative'], ['assignments', 'left off a section required', 'negative'], ['documents', 'either not covered or barely covered', 'negative']]

A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course . Many were passed onto " look this up yourself " , which is fine , but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong . The group _ by stuff was especially tricky , as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example , eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) .

Course had good structure , the videos were informative and really encouraging to go and start moving , from simple things like stretching at home or in your office to more sophisticated activites like sports or dance . Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way – it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) – every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity . I thought this course will be just fun , you know , everyone knows that sitting too much is bad etc . , but it really worked for me as a motivation to set some goals and get moving .

Excellent course . Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel . Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach & verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .

The course was very useful in introducing me to the basic concepts of modelling . I am now familiar with the necessary vocabulary to participate in conversations about modelling .

Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed . That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook . In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting . Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB . If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book . The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .####[['video content', 'lot less', 'negative'], ['assignments', 'less interesting', 'negative'], ['slides', 'not easy to understand without the audio narration', 'negative'], ['review', 'difficult', 'negative'], ['assignments', 'Expect to spend a lot of time', 'negative']]

The course content is perfect , however the rating system is kind of disappointing .

Firstly I would like to thank Mrs Barbara Oakley , to have come up with such a brilliant MOOC and more over giving out for free . I won ' t say I was a good student or a bad student , but I was always a frustrated one . Even after getting a Post Graduate degree from one of the prestigious colleges , I remained frustrated and carried this frustration till date . Your course has helped me over come my frustrations in many ways . Even interviews with various field experts has been enriching and helped me realize that even scholars have made their way through practice and perseverance , that they were not naturally gifted ones but they got themselves trained , in particular or multiple areas that they have mastered .

The course is interesting and the self - reflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself . However , the course is very short . Each week takes less than 1 hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction . If you love to learn a lot about something , I don ' t think this course is for you .

I ' ve enjoyed this course greatly , and look forward to delve further into philosophy . I loved all of the talks by all the lecturers , and found their follow - up videos to be particularly helpful . Unfortunately , that also meant that there was no forum to access and discuss the questions posed by the lectures with other people taking the course , which I believe would have helped to hone my argumentative skills , which I believe is necessary to have ( and further develop and enhance ) , when learning about philosophy . Thank you very much for this amazing course . If you could introduce more philosophy courses ( particularly ones that are more advanced and in depth ) , that would be great !####[['course', 'enjoyed', 'positive'], ['lecturers', 'loved all of the talks', 'positive'], ['videos', 'particularly helpful', 'positive'], ['forum', 'no', 'negative'], ['course', 'amazing', 'positive']]
I have watched all the videos provided for this course and I think it ' s very educative , simple and well organized for a better understanding . The only thing I think lacking is example of real conflict situations like those between and within states , those between citizens and their elected governments etc . and conflict resolution skills or approaches used both nationally and internationally to resolve them .

This course changed my perspective about the process of learning . It gave me a deep understanding of how my brain works . It also provided important facts about memory and significant techniques such as the pomodoro and memory palace .

Very good course , not many available online courses on this subject . Warning : Course is very fast paced ( and the instructors give only broad hints as they move from 1 step to the next and it is left to us to figure out stuff - which is how it should be of course ) . Therefore expect to be kept busy throughout the course . I barely had any previous knowledge on the subject , so folks with some basic understanding of the subject may have a different view####[['course', 'Very good', 'positive'], ['course', 'very fast paced', 'negative'], ['instructors', 'give only broad hints', 'negative']]
Not as good as the Regression Course , but still very good . While I appreciate prof Guestrin ' s enthusiasm , I missed a little rigor and mathematical depth of the Regression ' s course by Prof . Fox . I learned a lot , but I feel that regression clicked with me a little better than classification . But that ' s probably me . In either case , the whole series are awesome so far , better , in my opinion , than Anrdrew Ng ' s ML course on coursera , A small suggestion would be to switch the main toolset from the Graphlab to something more common , like Sci - kit learn and Pandas .####[['Course', 'Not as good', 'negative'], ['Course', 'still very good', 'positive'], ['prof Guestrin', 'appreciate', 'positive'], ['Prof .

This course was useful and practical . It had essentially real - world application problems .

Outdated materials , theory is taught and then praxis is tested . Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory , or teach AND test praxis .

I thought she was a nice Teacher but Didn ' t teach the Basics steps into speaking & learning chinese . If she had started with ABC alphabet how to write & speak the first week then taught to sound each letter out in different pitches of volume 2week then to sentences building 3rd week so on . it would had been much more helpful I believe .

The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way . The range of technology covered was good and would be useful . The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go , the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course .####[['course', 'well structured', 'positive'], ['Prof Muppala', 'presents it in an interesting way', 'positive'], ['course', 'range of technology covered was good', 'positive'], ['CapStone Project', 'timelines are not realistic at all', 'negative'], ['course', 'artificial interim reports are distracting', 'negative']]

This course has amazing information in the lectures , but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes , you will have to re - take quizzes a number of times , no matter how well you are taking notes .

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .####[["Professor Kaul ' s", 'enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'not entirely helpful come time to face assignments', 'negative'], ["Professor Kaul ' s", 'NULL', 'negative'], ['lectures', 'disorganized and confusing fashion', 'negative'], ['assignments', 'challenging', 'positive']]

This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit . I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall . The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall . i . e . questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey .####[['Entrepreneurship', 'very briefly presents large picture concepts', 'positive'], ['Entrepreneurship', 'without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit', 'negative'], ['quizzes', 'focus more on what was said during the lectures', 'negative']]
This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop .

Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .####[['course', 'Good', 'positive'], ['course', 'strong point is simplicity', 'positive'], ['course', 'allows you to learn something useful', 'positive'], ['course', 'also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex', 'positive'], ['course', 'lack of explanation', 'negative'], ['course', 'required to memorize entire sentences', 'negative']]
Good course , gave it four rather than five starts because : The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions .

This is an excellent introduction to Chinese language and grammar . I think it could have some introduction to written Chinese because Pinyin is not so common .

It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship . It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once . More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well .
