Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer . One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1 - 3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues . Over all the material was good , I stuck at it even when I wanted to quit and feel knowledgeable now on the lesson taught .####[['Peter Clarke', 'positive'], ['forums', 'negative'], ['material', 'positive'], ['course', 'positive']]
I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning . The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments ; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it , what I ' m doing wrong , or sometimes I don ' t even know what the question wants me to do . However , with perseverance , I was able to get through every one of them .####[['machine learning', 'positive'], ['programming assignments', 'negative']]
Thank you for the course ! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting . Besides , it is really stimulating in terms of self - learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly .

In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education . In this course , students become members of a lively learning community that is always on .

A very interesting experience . I got imagination level - up . Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment .

A bit of a mess . If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups , you will be disappointed .

When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great .

I enjoyed the course , but I the scripting part was still mainly , " here ' s a script to add to the game , and then we ' ll look it over " .

This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera . I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon . I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video . Professor Ang explains the material very clearly . I always walked away feeling that any questions I might have were answered completely in the videos or in the discussions .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course', 'positive'], ['instructor', 'negative'], ['grading', 'negative'], ['course', 'neutral'], ['Coursera', 'neutral'], ['course', 'negative'], ['discussion board', 'negative']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? !

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on .

If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate , I would not recommend to participate in this course . The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['video', 'positive'], ['video', 'negative'], ['mentors', 'negative']]

An excellent course , Dr . Chuck manages to put various things with ease . Material as well as teaching is excellent .

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course', 'positive'], ['Andrew Ng', 'positive'], ['material', 'neutral']]
Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[['lectures', 'positive'], ['notes', 'positive'], ['assignments and quiz', 'positive'], ['Python', 'positive']]
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help .

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .####[['course', 'positive'], ['course', 'neutral'], ['course', 'negative']]
Im really fascinated with this course . By the way , i think some quiz have few mistakes as the module about pricing swaptions in the calibration model .

Very good course , but I did ' t like how the last week focused on test taking . The course should focus more on ' learning how to learn , ' not how to ace a test . In that regard , I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults . Why not spend more time on learning how to think innovatively ?####[['course', 'positive'], ['course', 'negative']]

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded . That was a sour point to the overall positive structure of the course .####[['course', 'positive'], ['forums', 'neutral'], ['graded', 'negative']]

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before . I worked hard to be able to follow it , but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were , I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it .

While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project , I didn ' t feel like the assignment ' s requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series . As someone who bought this course as one large pack ( four courses , one capstone project ) , it would ' ve been nice to see more intersection . I felt a little " in the dark " on some of this . Given the short timeline to finish the work , too , many of these requests need more time ( e . g . building personas needs user research , ideally ) .

This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism . Yes , the assignments require immersing oneself in problems that have little to do with parallelism per se . But they are interesting , fun , and of course they nicely illustrate the concepts that are being imparted . Another excellent course by EPFL .####[['course', 'neutral'], ['assignments', 'positive'], ['course', 'positive']]

Wayne comes across as very enthusiastic and likable . The course material is interesting . It does feel like the course if artificially stretched out a bit too long , though .

The course was very fruitful .

Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization , it ' s a bit of a bait - and - switch .

Some parts are needed more clarification . In other words , as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials , since the materials are not self - sufficient . Specially about simulation methods . However , this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5 . The absence of any help from TAs , based on my experience , is the reason . I expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course .####[['course', 'negative'], ['materials', 'negative'], ['course', 'positive'], ['TAs', 'negative']]

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !####[['course', 'positive'], ['peer review assignment', 'neutral']]
The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined .

I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments .

But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues .

Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate .

Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not .

I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly . I like to get a certificate , but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time .####[['teacher', 'positive'], ['material', 'positive'], ['homework assignment', 'negative']]

Great course , I learned a lot ! Just one thing I ' d like to see more clearly is that , during the course , all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by 12 .

I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance . Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets , early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing . I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects . There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing , but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable .####[['course', 'positive'], ['course', 'neutral']]

A five - week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans . The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system , differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music , biological interpretation of scales , and the impact of cultural differences onto music . The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education . Its real subject is certain topics in biology , not music . Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student , and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow .####[['biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music', 'positive'], ['biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music', 'negative']]

This course feels a lot like it ' s being taught by a non - teaching professor . The lectures are very long , not chunked for easy viewing ( to the point where I couldn ' t download to my phone for offline / off - wifi use ) . There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to " Selections " without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book .

Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before .

A brief but interesting introduction to HTML . Very few practical examples and exercises , but it does cover the basics like : syntax , semantics , what to pay attention to while creating own website . Love the way the material is presented by Mrs . Lent and will finish all three remaining courses . Combined with the HTML & CSS course at CODECADEMY I have the ability to write simple html , read somebody else ' s code and find resources necessary to get me started with my own page . Till now I always thought HTML and web design was boring , well not anymore ! I would recommend this course to somebody who is only starting to learn HTML .####[['HTML', 'positive'], ['HTML', 'negative'], ['Mrs . Lent', 'positive']]
Great course . Learned a lot about JSON and XML . Expanded my view of what is possible in programming .

Nice course , hometasks are about medium level difficulty ( in hackerrank terms ) . Problems are already half - completed , so you ' re just filling the gaps following the design . That really shows the power of scala in things like pattern matching ( suddenly , it ' s everywhere ! ) and functional programming approach ( lots of small functions with pretty narrow scopes ) .

A little basic for me . But it was mentioned this was meant for the absolute beginner . Nonetheless , as a developer that never dabbled in HTML , this dipped my curiosity for HTML5 .

The video materials were very poor , they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief . The course only contained a single project , which although fun , is not enough for learning a new language . After completing this course I feel that I don ' t really know Swift , but I can use it .

Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site !

This is an excellent code for both beginners and novice programmers who want to improve their problem - solving skills .

Dr . Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of " astronomy " . The slides were clear .

There is absolutely no supervision on this course . My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so , no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as ' late submission ' . I have reviewed 7 papers ( requirement of 3 ) and am shown as being deficient . It is as if I dropped into a void . I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help . I would NOT recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within Coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction .####[['course', 'negative'], ['review', 'negative']]
I enjoyed the contents and homeworks . Overall the delivery was very good , and I have grasped a lot . The main reason that I won ' t give 5 stars is the program assignment .

Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[['Professor', 'positive'], ['course', 'negative'], ['assignment', 'negative']]

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view .

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces .

Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else .

This was a great course for beginners who are looking to get into static website design as a starting point . I had taken this course first out of the ruby on rails specialty courses , and decided to enroll in the entire course .

The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step - by - step . The subtitles / transcripts are a disappointment : ( . Full of mistakes .

Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr . Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested , and I could follow along easily , with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises , so as not to discourage me . I ' ve tried to learn computer programming using Java ( inside & outside of a tertiary environment ) with very limited success , but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive .

The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on . So overal the course was very good , but negative was that the course was a bit too long I understand Coursera needs to finance the course , so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees .

A very enjoyable , engaging course which touches on the fundamentals of Linguistics . I found the professor , as well as the assistants delightful , and the language informants were also very exciting to have .

I sincerely hope I can take more courses from Leiden , or perhaps study there one day .

This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages . The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour . The assignments which comes later on can be a tad difficult for someone new to programming , but as the professor says , stick with it , solve it , and the feeling you get when you finish it is unparalleled .

Great course and a great experience over all .####[['course', 'positive'], ['lecturer', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'positive']]
Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months . I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace .####[['machine learning', 'positive'], ['machine learning', 'negative']]
This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste . All in all , it is a pity , that professor Ng does not offer a corresponding specialization . I would enroll immediately .####[['course', 'positive'], ['professor Ng', 'positive']]
The course is well structured and quite informative . Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses , this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable . The only draw back is that our work is corrected by the other learners and that correction is final .

So many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived . I ' m having a hard time seeing the relevance .

The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents . Affirmations are most times not justified at all ( " incremental prototyping will yield a feature - rich and robust software " ) . The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before . The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here .

The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to .

This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented .

A good course , giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy , their issues and opportunities . I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date . It really needs to be re - done . The Paris Agreement wasn ' t mentioned , some of the research is from the early 2000s , many of the lectures are at least 3 years old . This is an area that is changing rapidly , monthly , and this course can ' t really be seen to be current any more . Particularly the politics section in week 8 .####[['course', 'positive'], ['course', 'negative'], ['lectures', 'negative']]
This course was very useful for me in terms of remebering the Busines and Entrepreneuship concepts . This course is designed in easy and simple way to get knowledge on specific vocabulary . Teachers speak not fast and it is great for those who just starts to learn English for work or passing language exams . Course also have very bright , clear images , definitions and moreover it includes grammar classes . I can definitely advise this course that is led by teachers from Penn Unniversity .####[['course', 'positive'], ['Teachers', 'positive']]
Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it . The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side ( in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you ) , but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting , and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth . Really glad I put the time into it . Totally worth it .####[['course', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'positive'], ['programming assignments', 'neutral'], ['programming assignments', 'positive']]
The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz . There are so many disparate concepts , that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least , demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R . How to properly import the data , create the file , structure the data , and then perform some analysis . These concepts are introduced throughout the course , but never brought together in one complete project .####[['video lectures', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'negative'], ['first programming assignment', 'negative'], ['textbook', 'negative'], ['course', 'negative']]
Great course ! Goes over proper statistical inference and its interpretation from multiple perspectives . The hands - on R exercises are invaluable . Don ' t be scared off by them - you don ' t really need to know R to do them . If you interpret literature from the psychological or medical fields , this is a great resource .####[['course', 'positive'], ['exercises', 'negative']]
Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !####[['lectures', 'positive'], ['lecturers', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'positive']]
Professor Ng has layed out this course very well , I ' m impressed at what I was able to learn in a few weeks ! The subject matter was engaging , and even the math was easy to follow with the professor ' s explanations . I ' m very happy I took this course as this is a subject in which I ' ve always been interested , and I ' m confident I can use what I ' ve learned in real world applications .####[['Professor Ng', 'positive'], ['course', 'positive']]
