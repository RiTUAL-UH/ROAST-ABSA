Very interesting and handy . I ' m Spaniard , so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals , and the use of street market for shopping vegetables .

I am so glad to have found this course ! ! I had taken a course on MOS transistor operation during grad school , and never quite felt comfortable with the material , since not much time was spent discussing how the relevant mosfet equations came about . Professor Tsividis ' s discourse is like a breath of fresh air . They are so lucid that I feel I understand the material better now . The course is well structured ; as I go through it systematically , I can see how one lesson connects to the concepts presented in a previous one . Thank you so much , Dr . Tsividis for sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge about this topic .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'so glad'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'discourse is like a breath of fresh air'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'so lucid'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'well structured'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'Thank you so much'], ['Professor Tsividis', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'understand the material better']]

I enjoyed this course and recommend it . Prof . Fowler is very didatic and funny , and makes the classes nice to watch . I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given , and the support is not that perfection yet , but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance ( in my case , I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard . . . they were true mentors ) .

Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'not as a standalone'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'developed solely for the specialisation'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'not learn much concepts or theories or practice'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'basic'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'good enough'], ['video lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive', 'helpful'], ['video lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive', 'very basic']]
This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students .

Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Interesting'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'thought provoking'], ['peer assignment tasks', 'grades general', 'negative', 'very hard to hit'], ['presentation', 'presentation relatability', 'negative', 'not totally agreed'], ['presentation', 'presentation relatability', 'negative', 'nothing new']]

This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on - line . Prof . Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work .

I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr .

Wide - ranging and inclusive coverage of a vastly complex topic by an impressive list of erudite instructors . Very interesting , with very many jump - off points for further study . However . . . many of the translations into English were difficult to decipher , some to the point of near - obscurity . Sorry to say , translating of words does not reliably lead to transfer of meaning . Still , highly recommended for its reach in surveying the high points of the subject matter .

Very helpful for absolutely beginners . The content is well - organized and materials are carefully picked to provide concise , easy - to - read information for learners . Lectures are clear , well - presented , just - right informative ; accompanied by the great public speaking skill of the instructor , they are hence not intimidating or boring at all . Another plus point is the instructor constantly urging learners to go beyond " the passing point " and learn more on their own , which is a very key mindset to keep up with the fast , ever - changing landscape of Information Technologies . Don ' t feel lost or scared , since she ' ll provide you with great resources for further learning and references !####[['content', 'material quality', 'positive', 'well - organized'], ['materials', 'material quality', 'positive', 'concise'], ['materials', 'material comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'easy - to - read'], ['Lectures', 'presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'clear'], ['Lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive', 'well - presented'], ['Lectures', 'presentation relatability', 'positive', 'just - right informative'], ['instructor', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'great public speaking skill'], ['Lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive', 'not intimidating or boring'], ['instructor', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'constantly urging learners'], ['instructor', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'provide you with great resources'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'Very helpful'], ['materials', 'material quality', 'positive', 'carefully picked']]
I did not know anything about Ruby or Rails before this course . I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion : Ruby , Rails , Rspec , all other tools . However , I think the coverage of the unit testing concepts was really useful . I had to go for google quite many times to find out resolve issues I had with the tools and assignments .

This is an exceptional course . The quality of the lectures ‚Äì course content , lecturing approach , and audiovisual production ‚Äì is top - notch . Randy Picker provides a fascinating , engaging look at various devices and platforms , starting with their history and then integrating legal considerations , particularly under antitrust and copyright law . He presents the material in an easily comprehensible and digestible way , and explores subjects ( and objects ) that are very relevant in the modern , connected , digitized , and ( borrowing a word from this class ) mediated world .

I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy . I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson ( reading - > video ) and the entire course . I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing each case . Perhaps , an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in - video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos . However , where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section . There was no authority answering any questions whatsoever , not content related nor operational .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'fantastic introduction'], ['video', 'presentation quality', 'positive', 'especially enjoyed the structure'], ['Prof', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'did a great job'], ['Prof', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'enthusiastic'], ['Prof', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'no authority answering any questions'], ['discussion section', 'course general', 'neutral', 'NULL'], ['in - video question', 'assignments quantity', 'neutral', 'ask more']]
After being bored to death by his first highly complex and involved analytical / historical lectures , I skipped over every video that Prof . Germano lectured in .

I thoroughly enjoyed this course . It was a narrowly - defined topic ( Questionnaire Design ) that was well - explored ; this makes the course feel like you are actually learning something and does not feel overwhelming in the slightest .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise .

The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'well thought'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'basic'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'very easy to follow and finish'], ['Quizzes', 'assignments quality', 'neutral', 'alternating between very good and very bad'], ['peer grading', 'grades general', 'negative', "doesn ' t make for a good use"], ['videos', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'made with an indecent knowledge of the technology'], ['videos', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'green screens were used so badly'], ['slides', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'cut away and put back'], ['slides', 'presentation quality', 'negative', 'downright infuriating'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'very good opening'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative', 'needs serious improvement'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'masterfully set of lessons']]
The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected . For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria . The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous . There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over .####[['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'valuable'], ['assignments', 'assignments quality', 'negative', 'poorly integrated'], ['quizes', 'assignments relatability', 'negative', 'poorly tied to the lecture material'], ['quizes', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'ambiguous'], ['quizes', 'grades general', 'negative', 'single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over'], ['assignments', 'assignments quality', 'negative', 'left off a section required'], ['documents', 'material relatability', 'negative', 'either not covered or barely covered']]

A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course . Many were passed onto " look this up yourself " , which is fine , but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong . The group _ by stuff was especially tricky , as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example , eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) .

Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way ‚Äì it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) ‚Äì every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity .

A great course ! Mostly I joined this course as a re - cap since it was 15 years ago I took my examination . In applied math ' s ( algebra , optimization , . . . ) together with computer science ( AI , machine learning , . . . ) ) . I really enjoyed watching Andrew Ng videos and doing the Quiz ' s and programming exercises .

I am super confident even with just two weeks into the course of coming out as a really skilled developer , and hopefully have a fairly advanced " developer ' s intuition " . Best part is he has worked diligently on the minutest of details and been careful how on - line learning can be difficult . I have never done coding , and have often wondered what could be special to it . So . . guess the course approaches a specialisation successfully allowing retention of that " excitement & curiosity " that almost always is inherent to learning . Five stars already .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'super confident'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'really skilled developer'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'Five stars already']]

Excellent course . Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel . Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach & verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .

I definitely Recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about the basics of web design , HTML5 , and coding . The way this course is setup is perfect for beginners with its extremely helpful and insightful readings along with the course lecture video s . The professor has really done an amazing job of teaching and engaging students through the videos while also giving helpful resources and tips for students to venture on their own and investigate the topics further . I highly recommend to follow along , especially with the coding , when the professor suggest it . It will really help out in the long run and help you become familiar with the process .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'definitely Recommend'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'setup is perfect for beginners'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'extremely helpful'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive', 'insightful readings'], ['lecture video s', 'material quality', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['professor', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'really done an amazing job'], ['professor', 'faculty response', 'positive', 'helpful']]
Excellent course ! My only " complaint " really is that I wish the instructors would use other tools besides GraphLab .

I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two . However , as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging .

Then again , the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder . . . )####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'really enjoyed'], ['course', 'course quality', 'neutral', 'making the final module a bit more challenging']]

The course was very useful in introducing me to the basic concepts of modelling . I am now familiar with the necessary vocabulary to participate in conversations about modelling . It also refreshed my intuition on the basic mathematical functions . Most interesting part was the steps I have to follow when I want to construct a particular model in order to help me in answering questions about a business process . I also found out that this is a continuous process and usually I might not construct good one from the first time .

Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed . That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook . In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting . Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB . If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book . The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .####[['video content', 'material quantity', 'negative', 'lot less'], ['assignments', 'assignments quality', 'negative', 'less interesting'], ['slides', 'presentation comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'not easy to understand without the audio narration'], ['review', 'grades general', 'negative', 'difficult'], ['assignments', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'Expect to spend a lot of time']]

I learned so much from this course ! It was amazing how Dr . Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses , such as evaluation strategy , functional collections , reactive programming , and associativity , to describe the core of Spark in only four units . As someone coming from more of a statistics background , I started this specialization only to learn Spark , so I wasn ' t always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be . It turns out that it was pretty essential , while also just making me a better programmer . Looking forward to the capstone !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'learned so much'], ['Dr .

I like Amy Bloom , but the lectures don ' t provide the explanations or the processes for creating characters . In the Craft of Plot , Skyhorse gave us the tools we need to develop plot and structure , and even how to start to develop characters . But in this course , the lectures don ' t do that .

Personally felt this course have a lot more potential . The explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts .

All three parts ( html css and javascript ) covered by this course are well taught . It is targets beginners very well . I especially like the way how javascript is introduced - - in contrast to normal programming language courses which start with grammar , here it starts with examples . This way one can very fast already start programming something , which is much more interesting . Also the quizzes , exercises and projects are well thought through and help a lot with understanding and learning .

A must in a world more and more complexe , but where science says everything is connected , and good interactions can make the whole system evolve .

Firstly I would like to thank Mrs Barbara Oakley , to have come up with such a brilliant MOOC and more over giving out for free . I won ' t say I was a good student or a bad student , but I was always a frustrated one . Even after getting a Post Graduate degree from one of the prestigious colleges , I remained frustrated and carried this frustration till date . Your course has helped me over come my frustrations in many ways . Even interviews with various field experts has been enriching and helped me realize that even scholars have made their way through practice and perseverance , that they were not naturally gifted ones but they got themselves trained , in particular or multiple areas that they have mastered . Thank you once again for sharing these powerful tools and techniques , which has not only enhanced my learning ability , but helped me with getting my thinking process right .####[['Mrs Barbara Oakley', 'course general', 'positive', 'thank'], ['NULL', 'platform prices', 'positive', 'giving out for free']]
This is really a good set of tools for law students . I have finished the first week , and it really helped a lot already .

A really nice , gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language .

Not the greatest Python course in the world . Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized , technical issues are common , and the discussion forums do not offer much value , as you cannot discuss your code with your peers , and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful . The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it ' s enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around !

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well .

Fantastic course . I ' m not very good at actually completing MOOCs ( something about not having to answer to anyone , I suspect ! ) but the reviewing of classmates ' work was done nicely , enough pressure to mean the assignments actually got done , without requiring an unreasonable amount of time . Douglas is a fantastic teacher and really inspiring ; the course has revitalised my writing in just the way I needed !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Fantastic'], ['Douglas', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Douglas', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'really inspiring'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'revitalised my writing'], ['reviewing', 'grades general', 'positive', 'done nicely'], ['assignments', 'assignments workload', 'positive', 'without requiring an unreasonable amount of time']]

Great ! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student . It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm . The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example . If this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm , it will be a perfect course !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'great'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['assignment', 'assignments quality', 'positive', 'chance to practice these algorithms']]
Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'strong point is simplicity'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'allows you to learn something useful'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive', 'also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'lack of explanation'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'required to memorize entire sentences']]
Good course , gave it four rather than five starts because : The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions . The videos referred to course material that was not always there . On the plus side , I found the course material useful and well structured . The personal journal was an essential part of the course and it should be emphasized as such . Without it I would not have learnt as much .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['discussion boards', 'faculty response', 'negative', 'too prescriptive'], ['videos', 'presentation relatability', 'negative', 'referred to course material that was not always there'], ['material', 'material quality', 'positive', 'useful'], ['material', 'material quality', 'positive', 'well structured']]
This is an excellent introduction to Chinese language and grammar . I think it could have some introduction to written Chinese because Pinyin is not so common . I struggled with some of the quizzes where written answers were given , even when my answers were correct some quizzes required stops ( . ) others didn ' t . Apart from that it was excellent .####[['Chinese language and grammar', 'course general', 'positive', 'excellent introduction'], ['quizzes', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative', 'struggled'], ['Chinese language and grammar', 'course general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['Chinese language and grammar', 'course general', 'positive', 'excellent']]
The material in this course is very interesting . I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms . I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry - level manner - it will take some hands - on practice with real datasets to build expertise , understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base . I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming . I completed the Python for Everybody specialization , but still struggled with the programming in this course .####[['material', 'material quality', 'positive', 'very interesting'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'comfortable']]
The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening . For an institution like the host institution , this is odd . I liked the course , but it was not very well organized . Seems like it was for experienced musicians , eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well . Good Course , badly organized .####[['teacher', 'faculty response', 'negative', 'forum discussions is deafening'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'liked'], ['course', 'course quality', 'negative', 'not very well organized'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'Good'], ['course', 'course quality', 'negative', 'badly organized']]
It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship . It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once . More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well . It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business . Thank you to all the teaching faculty for this great learning experience .####[['NULL', 'course quality', 'positive', 'extremely intriguing'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'exciting to learn the program modules'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'still retain the fun elements'], ['NULL', 'course quality', 'positive', 'gripping right till the end'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'fun learning experience'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'eye opener'], ['teaching faculty', 'faculty general', 'positive', 'Thank you'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive', 'great learning experience']]
The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting . I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did . I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation . Thankyou coursera and the Michigan State University for the opportunity .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive', 'great'], ['coursera', 'platform general', 'positive', 'Thankyou']]
