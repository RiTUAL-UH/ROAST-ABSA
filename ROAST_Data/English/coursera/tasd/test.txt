Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer .

I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning . The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments ; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it , what I ' m doing wrong , or sometimes I don ' t even know what the question wants me to do . However , with perseverance , I was able to get through every one of them .####[['machine learning', 'course general', 'positive'], ['programming assignments', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative']]
Thank you for the course ! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting . Besides , it is really stimulating in terms of self - learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly .

In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education . In this course , students become members of a lively learning community that is always on .

A very interesting experience . I got imagination level - up . Though it was really difficult to understand what should you do in each assignment .

A bit of a mess . If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups , you will be disappointed . Assignments are good and thought - provoking , but not clearly written . You will get out of the course what you invest in it .

When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great .

This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera . I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon . I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['instructor', 'faculty response', 'negative'], ['grading', 'grades general', 'negative'], ['course', 'course quality', 'neutral'], ['Coursera', 'platform general', 'neutral'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['discussion board', 'faculty general', 'negative']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? ! In addition , you can ' t participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself .

The material given is good for an introductory course on child nutrition . The graphics and didactic material is very good . I would suggest that Dr .

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on . I still made an attempt to watch the course content , but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance .

The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['video', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['video', 'presentation quality', 'negative'], ['mentors', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative']]

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['Andrew Ng', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['material', 'material quality', 'neutral']]
Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[['lectures', 'presentation quantity', 'positive'], ['notes', 'material quality', 'positive'], ['assignments and quiz', 'assignments relatability', 'positive'], ['assignments and quiz', 'assignments quality', 'positive'], ['Python', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['Python', 'course general', 'positive'], ['Python', 'course quality', 'positive']]
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .####[['Professor', 'faculty general', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['quizzes', 'assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'grades general', 'negative'], ['forum', 'faculty response', 'negative'], ['quizzes', 'assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative'], ['Professor', 'faculty response', 'negative']]

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'neutral'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['course', 'course relatability', 'negative']]
Im really fascinated with this course . By the way , i think some quiz have few mistakes as the module about pricing swaptions in the calibration model . The answer the professor gave is not 13300 or 19400 , but 1330 or 1940 respectively .

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded .

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience .

This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism .

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking . Rating on a 1 - 5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems , as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews . I hope it can be improved in the future !####[['course', 'course quality', 'positive'], ['peer review assignment', 'grades general', 'neutral']]
The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined .

I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues . Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'assignments quality', 'negative'], ['teaching assistants', 'faculty response', 'negative'], ['illustrations', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['illustrations', 'presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['lecturer', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'neutral']]
Not a very good course . The assignments are not very clear . Could have done much more like integrating front - end etc in place of that loopback module . Was really disappointed with this one .

Really interesting thesis about the impetus behind the formation of the Hebrew Bible . Makes a convincing case by linking the historical , geographical , archaeological , and textual evidence . Great lectures and guest lectures . Also provides a case for why studying the bible is important even for secular humanists and atheists .

Loved this course . The lecture videos were very clear , well framed , loved the white background and the instructor was always looking at the camera . The animated illustrations provided made the lecture extremely fun to watch and a lot easier to understand .

What I loved about this course is the nature of the assignments which stressed the point of actually doing negotiations with other classmates , it forced me to interact with complete strangers from different countries and review the work of others , which was an immensely pleasant experience . great . thx to dr oakley for wonderful videos n i liked her style of teaching . always with a smiling face !####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['lecture videos', 'presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['lecture videos', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['instructor', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['animated illustrations', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['animated illustrations', 'presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['Barry', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'assignments quality', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'grades general', 'positive'], ['dr oakley', 'faculty general', 'positive']]

The lectures are a very brief overview of topics , with nothing actually taught . The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages . This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn , Coursera , and everyone involved . It ' s clear that the instructors don ' t care about student ' s actually learning anything .

The ideas are good , but I dislike the presentation . It ' s hard to read the screen and quotes when they ' re only on the screen for a few moments .

Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate . So I went through all the open sites which were extremely disappointing . Since I was warned by the reviews , I was not even tempted to pay to unlock further pages . I attended many interesting courses on Coursera , but this one is simply a waste of time from the very first moment .####[['course', 'course general', 'negative']]

Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !####[['peer assessments', 'assignments quality', 'positive'], ['peer assessments', 'assignments quality', 'negative'], ['material', 'material quality', 'negative'], ['grading', 'grades general', 'negative'], ['instructor', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['courses', 'course general', 'negative']]
I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly . I like to get a certificate , but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time .####[['teacher', 'faculty value', 'positive'], ['material', 'material quality', 'positive'], ['homework assignment', 'assignments quality', 'negative'], ['homework assignment', 'assignments workload', 'negative']]

Great course , I learned a lot ! Just one thing I ' d like to see more clearly is that , during the course , all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by 12 .

I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance . Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets , early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing . I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects . There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing , but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'neutral']]

A five - week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans . The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system , differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music , biological interpretation of scales , and the impact of cultural differences onto music . The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education . Its real subject is certain topics in biology , not music .

This course feels a lot like it ' s being taught by a non - teaching professor . The lectures are very long , not chunked for easy viewing ( to the point where I couldn ' t download to my phone for offline / off - wifi use ) . There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to " Selections " without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book .

Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch .

I ' d highly recommend that anyone considering doing the course does the assignments since this is where the real magic happens - Andrew quite deviously leaves a bit of the theory to be fully worked out by yourself in the assignments ) .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['content', 'material relatability', 'positive'], ['teacher', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['Andrew', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course workload', 'negative'], ['lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'assignments workload', 'negative']]

It is an interesting course . I would say this course expects more from students than other courses . It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas .

I ' ve tried the Python course of Rice university , and some part of the Codecademy Python course ! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python . Compared to the Rice University course , this one is more for a new beginner who hasn ' t done any coding before . The Rice course doesn ' t really need any coding exp , but with the projects get more complicated in the end , it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before , at least in my opinion .

Andrew takes the time to clearly explain the concepts . Most quizzes and programming assignments helped reinforce your understanding of these topics .

I am not connecting to the instructor at all . The material is well managed and organized but I am not able to really hear or understand . Further , my connection to the site is disturbing .

This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning . It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course . I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor . Don ' t let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent . For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization , I should warn that this one is much more difficult , particularly for those without prior teaching experience , and far more practically based .####[['lesson planning', 'course general', 'positive'], ['instructor', 'faculty comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['material', 'material quality', 'positive']]

This was a good overview of the services Google Cloud Platform offers . There were a few bugs with the quizzes , but overall it was put together well and had a lot of information for a short course .

The tutorials and exercises are quick walk - throughs that can be completed in 10 - 15 minutes each .

The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science .

Good introduction to basics . A few improvements are warranted : Lessons could be reordered in a more logical progression , particularly when it comes to Git . Gitbash is not easy or intuitive .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that .

Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn ' t figure out what the correct answer was . Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared .

I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help .

Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[['Professor', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'negative'], ['assignment', 'assignments quality', 'negative'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['assignment', 'assignments workload', 'negative']]

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts " triangular theory of love " and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['contents', 'material quality', 'positive'], ['contents', 'material relatability', 'positive'], ['lecturer', 'faculty general', 'negative']]

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces . The programming assignments may require a learning curve for those who have never used a Matlab / Octave environment , especially using the vectorized operations instead of loops but that is also well worth the time and effort .

Nice course ! It is definitely a beginner ' s course , and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course . I really think there should be an option for people who aren ' t absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and / or do the capstone . After all , this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science , which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners .

Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it .

Other schools like Gnomon WorkShop and DVDs like " Eat3D " and many others out there , which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here !

As I recall the original Introduction to Python Dr . Chuck course which debuted 3 to 4 years back or so , was split into two . So this is is like the 2nd part of the original course ( split into 2 as it was deemed slightly overwhelming for beginners ) .

Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge .

Bu the extra review rounds felt redundant , and because the course was so long it was difficult to keep focussed on it .####[['content', 'material quality', 'positive'], ['assignment', 'assignments quality', 'positive'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course workload', 'negative'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative']]

I don ' t recall any ambiguity in his teachings and his voice was clear . I also enjoy some of the assignments because I surprise myself by producing some great images .

A very enjoyable , engaging course which touches on the fundamentals of Linguistics . I found the professor , as well as the assistants delightful , and the language informants were also very exciting to have . It was challenging at a few points despite my background and interest in Linguistics , however , it was well worth the effort . I sincerely hope I can take more courses from Leiden , or perhaps study there one day . This course reaffirmed my interest in Leiden from 10 years ago .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['professor', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['assistants', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive']]
This course was outstanding ! I learned more from one month of this course than I did while taking a semester of computer science course at my university . Also , the language being taught in this course ( Python ) is much more intuitive than many of the other programming languages I have tried ( C + + and BASIC ) . This course is a must for anyone who wants to learn computer science !####[['course', 'course quality', 'positive'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive']]
Sorry , but the course is very poor . I ' ve watched all the videos of the first week and it ' s mostly about nothing . And , by the way , too much stories .

This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages . The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour . The assignments which comes later on can be a tad difficult for someone new to programming , but as the professor says , stick with it , solve it , and the feeling you get when you finish it is unparalleled . All the doubts and queries in the discussion forums are answered quickly and efficiently . Great course and a great experience over all .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['lecturer', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['assignments', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['lecturer', 'faculty response', 'positive']]
Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months . I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace .####[['machine learning', 'course general', 'positive'], ['machine learning', 'course general', 'negative']]
This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste . All in all , it is a pity , that professor Ng does not offer a corresponding specialization . I would enroll immediately .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['professor Ng', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
The course is well structured and quite informative . Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses , this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable . The only draw back is that our work is corrected by the other learners and that correction is final .

This is a very thorough introductory course to the field of Machine Learning . I would have given it 5 stars , but towards the end , I felt the lessons got a bit sloppier .

The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents . Affirmations are most times not justified at all ( " incremental prototyping will yield a feature - rich and robust software " ) . The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before . The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here .

The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to . A couple of math notations were also incorrect , for example " < " when the professor said " less than or equal to " . Overall though , I ' m pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study . excellent course ! they teach you all the terms and sentences you need to know either as a beginner learning Korean or if you ' re planning to travel there .

This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented .

Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it . The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side ( in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you ) , but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting , and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth .

The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz . There are so many disparate concepts , that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least , demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R . How to properly import the data , create the file , structure the data , and then perform some analysis . These concepts are introduced throughout the course , but never brought together in one complete project .####[['video lectures', 'presentation relatability', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'presentation relatability', 'negative'], ['first programming assignment', 'assignments comprehensiveness', 'negative'], ['first programming assignment', 'assignments relatability', 'negative'], ['textbook', 'material quality', 'negative'], ['course', 'course general', 'negative']]
Great course ! Goes over proper statistical inference and its interpretation from multiple perspectives . The hands - on R exercises are invaluable . Don ' t be scared off by them - you don ' t really need to know R to do them . If you interpret literature from the psychological or medical fields , this is a great resource .####[['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['exercises', 'assignments quality', 'negative']]
Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !####[['lectures', 'presentation quality', 'positive'], ['lectures', 'presentation comprehensiveness', 'positive'], ['lecturers', 'faculty general', 'negative'], ['NULL', 'course general', 'positive']]
Professor Ng has layed out this course very well , I ' m impressed at what I was able to learn in a few weeks ! The subject matter was engaging , and even the math was easy to follow with the professor ' s explanations . I ' m very happy I took this course as this is a subject in which I ' ve always been interested , and I ' m confident I can use what I ' ve learned in real world applications .####[['Professor Ng', 'faculty general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course general', 'positive'], ['course', 'course quality', 'positive'], ['course', 'course comprehensiveness', 'positive']]
