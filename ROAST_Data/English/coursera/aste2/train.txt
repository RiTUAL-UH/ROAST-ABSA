Great introduction to Java . Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start , rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses , which is really cool .

I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area , as well as great machine learning enthusiasts . However , I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and ( very ! ) expensive platform , mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning .

I think this was a very good course . Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours / week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics .

Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples . One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks : Week 4 and Week 5 .

Just finished the course " a little bit " ahead of February .

This didn ' t contribute to the original posters question . Despite that Dr . Chuck ' s courses are always a real pleasure !####[([84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89], [91, 92, 93, 94], 'POS')]
Great course ! I highly recommend it both for teachers and teacher trainers . All content is delivered in a very engaging manner . Although I have already had a solid previous experience in the area , I have gained a lot from this course . It is definitely worth taking if you are interested in effective professional development . the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms . For example , the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market . Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year . for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15 % , then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [4, 5, 6], 'POS'), ([15], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([44], [39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([44], [48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([44], [67, 68, 69, 70, 71], 'POS')]
The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking . You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand . Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project , in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project . The quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning . Overall I would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences .####[([1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 'NEG'), ([9, 10, 11], [16, 17], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [38, 39], 'NEG'), ([68], [78, 79], 'NEG'), ([104], [82, 83, 84], 'NEG'), ([104], [93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99], 'NEG')]
The title says it all . Great overview of the history , technology , and security of internet .

I ' ve never valued tests , nor flash cards , nor anything that I perceived as gimmicky learning tools . Learning was just learning . But I was wrong .

Extremely well done videos , Professor Sachs is articulate and clear . The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment . The quiz are not easy , one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5 . However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it ' s a good learning process . It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long !####[([3], [0, 1, 2], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([13], [16, 17], 'NEG'), ([30], [32, 33], 'NEG')]

Lectures and quizzes are okay , assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics . I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs . However , I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks . Programming assignments aren ' t really friendly to Haskell ' s list , and vectors are not available .

Machine Learning is an excellent course with great presentations . This is not an easy course , and I found myself reviewing concepts and being challenged to dive deeper into the material .

This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security , but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities .

I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn ' t always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted . For a non - specialist , statistics is almost always a struggle , intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math . I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough . I hate being a quitter , but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self - doubt because I just couldn ' t match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course . Maybe other people are much smarter than I am , but this source was a soul and time killer for me .####[([3], [5, 6], 'NEG'), ([3], [184, 185, 186, 187], 'NEG')]

The course is a very practical approach to the language . The main goal of it being to help you get by in the country . It ' s title should be Surviving in China 101 . Although misleading for people wanting to learn the language to an extensive level , it ' s definitely a good base to have and to build on . The material is presented in a very accessible manner and the quizzes help you master the key elements acquired within each session .

I have taken several classes here and I have to say this is one of the best .

The course has enhanced my reading experience . Writing in the margins… up till now I have never challenged or asked the writer any questions .

There is quality implicit in the approach taken , but in my opinion , this course is excessively short , having only 20 - 25 minutes of videos per week , what is very limiting . Also there is no slides of the material covered what I find not adequate . To fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures , slides would be determinant . Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning .####[([15], [17, 18], 'NEG'), ([43], [48, 49], 'NEG')]

Great course ! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve . The case studies were relevant and interesting , and the guest speakers were good as well .

Decent coverage of the basics , but some of the data , tools and approaches used are out of date by 2 - 3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast - moving social space . For example , they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM . For someone completely new to the social space , this could be a great starter class . Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you ' re current . After grading assignments by other students , it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat : most either didn ' t invest in the assignments or didn ' t understand the materials . While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material , I didn ' t have that experience in this session .####[([134], [129, 130, 131, 132], 'NEG')]
This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic , but doesn ' t go into much depth . While it ' s clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material , I still would not recommend this course . Both the presentation itself and the in - video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious . The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to , and the in - video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time . Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities , which are badly designed and just frustrating .

I was really happy that I took this course . I made me see areas where I could improve my learning as well as provide me with new ideas that would help me in learning .

It is a great course for me . At the end of the course , I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation . As opposed to the stated prerequisite , I believe the course requires engineering / math / physics background . On the down side , there is no TA presence in the discussion forum .

The content of the slides were sufficient for the basic intent of this offering . The overview and reasoning behind why the products are competitive for other contending services was clear . When performing the labs , the content is very recipe driven . While that works well for someone attempting to get the work done , there needs to be some visuals prepared that show how the GCP components are laid out and the relationship they have to each other ( simple architecture views ) . The GCP products have very similar sounding names , so paragraphs describing what is happening have less effect , whereas some simple architecture views of what the lab is intending to do to go with that in the lab content itself , might help .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [6], 'POS')]

Good and necessary introduction to Python . But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved . It´s good to know how to clean the data but it´s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it´s not . Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means .####[([9, 10], [15, 16, 17], 'NEU')]
Aside from week 4 , I found this course to be little more than a commercial for various social analytics programs . Also , there ' s a Google + assignment . Google + wasn ' t relevant five years ago , let alone in 2016 . There ' s some potential in this course but it desperately needs to be updated for 2017 .

A super course , and available at just the right time . With journalists and journalism under assault , it ' s time for news consumers like me to have a better understanding of what we and our communities are up against . I truly appreciate that now I have a framework ( and tools ) to look at what is out there , which is helping me know what I think better and gives me strategies to talk constructively with friends and family when talking about the news .

If you have some background programming in another language , and some familiarity with HTML / CSS , this course does a fantastic job introducing both Ruby and Rails . The first week walks you through machine and environment setup , the second walks through the basics of the Ruby programming language , and the third walks through using the Rails framework to develop simple websites in Ruby . All the lessons are laid out clearly with solid examples . That said , this is not a beginner course . It really only spends a week covering how to program in Ruby , and Ruby has some quirks that make it a challenging first language . If you ' re brand new to programming , do yourself a favor and take an introductory course first .####[([19], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([71], [73, 74, 75], 'POS'), ([71], [77, 78], 'POS')]

Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn ' t sufficient . Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes . This is the reason why Andrew Ng ' s Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging . Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful . I hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session .####[([2, 3], [5, 6], 'POS')]
This course has been very interesting , however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited . While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists , I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance : picking up litter , photographing it , and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography , unless the artist ' s message is in documenting our ' throw - away ' society and highlighting the importance of ' recycling ' for the benefit of the environment . Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion . The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused . The interviewer ( s ) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist ( s ) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests . My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent .####[([1], [4, 5], 'POS')]
Functional Program Design in Scala is one of the best courses for those who want to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications using functional programming concepts .

I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift . The lessons felt very unstructured , unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded , this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an " introduction to . . . course . A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming . To summarise , the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content .####[([42], [44, 45], 'NEG'), ([42], [47, 48, 49, 50], 'NEG')]

Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course . Booksite , video materials and assignments are amazing . Would recommend this course to everyone ! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree . Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted . not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks . hard for a student ( even one who has a programming background ) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront . The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course . the whole course seems disjointed . would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving .####[([2], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([5], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([7], [14], 'POS'), ([9, 10], [14], 'POS'), ([12], [14], 'POS'), ([5], [17], 'POS'), ([5], [136, 137], 'NEG')]

The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS')]

I ' ll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing . There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways . The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking . The reason that I ' ve only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework .

I do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates . Half of this course should have been condensed or excluded .

Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX , it is still very underwhelming .

Thanks Professor Hare and Coursera since I do enjoy this amazing course which challenges many stereotypes .

However , in this course , Professor Hare points out that cognition involves many types of intelligence rather than one and there is even tremendous variation within a dog breed in temperament , behavior and especially cognition .

Very great course , I get a lot of MongoDB and Mongoid knowledge . This course is hard for the new comer of Ruby on Rails and MongoDB .

There ' s a lot of great information in this course and it ' s presented in a very good way .

I really liked this course . Although some of it depended too much on pre - made scripts it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex ( like all of Unity ' s own tutorials are ) . Sometimes , it went to fast and I was quickly switching from Unity to Coursera to hit the " pause " button to give me time to catch up .

I did this course last year , and consider it to be among the very best I have seen . It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers , everyone of whom know that material very well ; they are great presenters also .

These guys actually did it , and they did it well !

If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you . The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable . Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions . Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer . I ' m very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R .####[([11], [14, 15, 16, 17], 'NEG'), ([11], [96, 97], 'NEG')]

Quick overview of the Arduino platform . Since I was new to Arduino , it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively . The peer - reviewed grading process is something that can be improved .

Also , more elaborate treatment of how to implement security in communication over internet with Arduino would have been great .####[([25, 26, 27, 28, 29], [33, 34, 35], 'NEG')]

Challenging if not a developer and grader needs very specific code . that aside , this was a fun interesting course , great intro to bluemix and Node - red and js . Need to allow significant time to research around content taught and decomposing programming assignments takes time . Make use of forums and post queries - peers answer as well as staff .

This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices . Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student . That being said , a programming newbie should have no problem following it .

This is a very good introduction to machine learning . It covers a very broad set of material , and the lectures are very clear . The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material , making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material ( in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course ) . It is very helpful to have some programming experience , and some knowledge of linear algebra , probability , and calculus . The course is very topical , so it does not go very deep into the material , but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications .####[([100], [3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([21], [23, 24], 'POS'), ([45], [41, 42, 43], 'POS')]

A practical course by a capable professor . Too simple in terms of theoretical aspects , but Prof . Ng is very good at making abstract concepts and methodologies easy to follow and understand .

The Professor is excellent and very student - friendly , and the course material is very clear . Two issues though : 1 ) List comprehensions should be introduced .

It doesn ' t go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5 - 6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high .####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([1], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([12, 13], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([50], [53, 54, 55, 56], 'NEG'), ([88], [87], 'NEG'), ([50], [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], 'NEG')]
Once again , Prof Chaikin has hit the ball out of the park in terms of design ( very hands - on ! ) of lessons and delivery of content . The painstaking attention to detail , intuition about particular pitfalls for new learners ( and more proficient ones too , in fact ) and of course , the self - deprecating humor all contribute to making this actually pretty advanced course a whole lotta fun !

The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R . This being said , I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth ( with further practice ) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery . I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy , and only now ( after completing the course here on Coursera , reading the textbook ( s ) , and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp ) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R .

This course is basic yet so powerful and will excite those who enroll that they would like to study the subject and that I feel is the most important objective of any course .

This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package , but suffers from some problems . The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments . The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky .

Introduction is much more than this course is , in my respectful opinion . When I read the information on the specialized program , I thought it was something more compact , more useful in the face of the video game industry .

Only one assignment at the end , so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code ( this seems like a big mistake for any programming course ) . The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes . You can ' t put that as a project on a resume , because you ' re doing 5 % of the work with your hand held through it . Worst of all , the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices , like local variables not being declared ( so that they become global variables , a big no - no ) , spacing being all over the place , etc . JavaScript has a bad reputation , and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad .####[([135], [134], 'NEG')]

So much disjointed information . . . I felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this . Am waiting for another 8 hours before I can reattempt the quiz . Personally , I feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics ( simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course ) . The logical progression of how to approach different problems - and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the window . If you ' re new to statistics , I suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided . . .####[([38], [2, 3], 'NEG')]

While this is a great course for introductory programming , I believe that it suffers from its focus on cokeskultpor UI design . The main issue I have with it is that these skills are not easily transferred to real world applications . I think some time spent on a basic introduction to tkinter would be good to help get people started on how to make their own programs . I found that the grading rubrick in particular focused too much on simple UI elements and not enough on making sure that the code was good or that the game even worked . For example , I had one person who had everything in pong perfect except that the score was added when the ball hit the paddle . This meant that the game as whole did not work as expected , but it only cost him 2 marks .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([5], [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'NEG')]

This my first machine learning course and I am very satisfied with it . The bottom - up approach really helped me understand how machine learning evolve . I only cannot understand the proper action to do if I have to use data mining application as modern data mining applications provide diverse algorithms .

Overall , a good and challenging course that covered a range of material from perceptrons to feed forward nets and Deep Belief Networks . However , I felt that some of the material is a little dated - convolutional neural networks did not get the coverage warranted by their recent successes . Some of the quiz items were " off - syllabus " too , although this encouraged further reading . I enjoyed the programming exercises , particularly on Restricted Boltzmann Machines , and would have liked more of them . For beginners I would recommend they take Andrew Ng ' s course first .####[([6], [3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([32], [35, 36], 'NEU'), ([74, 75], [72], 'POS'), ([74, 75], [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89], 'NEU'), ([55, 56], [59, 60, 61], 'NEG')]
Because of this course , I am more aware of opportunities to negotiate in my every day interactions with others . I enjoyed Professor Siedel ' s teaching style . He gets you to think on a deeper level , especially when he poses questions and presents scenarios . The course material is framed in a comprehensive manner . In hindsight , this course on negotiation has shown me how much of a poor negotiator I was . However , I now feel more empowered by what I ' ve learned .####[([50, 51], [53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'POS'), ([3], [7, 8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [22], 'POS')]
Very Nice interface , Mobile friendly , Just for writing coding assignments I had to use laptop . If App supported the same , It would have been more convenient .

Very interesting subject matter , and I learned a lot . My biggest complaint is that many of the programming exercises have errors in them that haven ' t been fixed , despite this course having been running for years . This always left me wondering if an incorrect output was an error on my part , or an error in the provided code . Still , I thoroughly enjoyed the course as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a foundation in machine learning .####[([19, 20], [22, 23, 24], 'NEG'), ([71], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([71], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([71], [77, 78], 'POS'), ([71], [7, 8, 9], 'POS')]

Great course . my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities , it ' s just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met , especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members . I just wonder if there ' s a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the website allows for better asynchronous work ( not just emailing back and forth as that feels very disorganized ) ? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great intro class . i ' ve learned tons of new things . i would like to have more materials on the subject . could the staff attach some recommended readings ? other courses ? than you for making this course : )####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([126], [122, 123, 124, 125], 'NEG'), ([1], [97, 98, 99], 'POS'), ([1], [107, 108], 'POS'), ([1], [114, 115, 116, 117, 118], 'POS')]
Great case study , but the way to engage the audience might have been way better . Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power , because they were quite boring . Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment . Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization . Capstone should have been done by the same ( high ) standards as other courses in specialization .####[([17], [35, 36], 'NEG'), ([53], [55, 56], 'NEG'), ([17], [23, 24], 'NEG'), ([53], [58], 'NEG')]
This is a very interesting and rewarding course . It would help if the format was broken up a bit more . Perhaps with some video of power plants , turbines , etc .

It is the first course I have successfully completed on Coursera . I had a vague background in programming from my undergraduate studies in Engineering , but I have always wanted to learn more .

Week 3 application assignment is buggy . If you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect . You must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for .

I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway .

I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general .

Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning .

I enjoyed this course and recommend it . Prof . Fowler is very didatic and funny , and makes the classes nice to watch . I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given , and the support is not that perfection yet , but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance ( in my case , I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard . . . they were true mentors ) . Anyway , if you have some interest in series , I am sure you will enjoy this course .####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([3], [5], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [12, 13, 14, 15], 'POS'), ([30], [32, 33], 'NEG'), ([3], [101], 'POS'), ([57], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'NEG'), ([8, 9, 10], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS')]
Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[([6], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'NEG'), ([63, 64], [75], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [77, 78], 'POS'), ([6], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'NEG'), ([6], [51], 'POS'), ([6], [53, 54], 'POS')]
This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students .

Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[([4], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([7, 8, 9], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([11], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG')]
Awesome class . It was very accessible and had some great examples . I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students .

This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on - line . Prof . Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work .

This is an excellent course for two reasons : first the video lectures are very good , introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner , and second the automated submission system is good at marking your ( well designed ) assignments . What could be better : compared to a traditional ( physical ) course , I miss the notes . It would be very useful if there was some form of notes , either as an informal textbook or cheat - sheets for each lecture . Another improvement would be that in some cases , it ' s possible to ' solve ' the assignments without necessarily understanding them .

This class was really difficult . The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes ( particularly in Week 3 & 4 ) and the final exam was immensely difficult . Additionally , the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i . e . repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs .

The lecture quality should be dramatically improved . Even at 2x speed , I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos . In the conclusion , Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is " new " , but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist , and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old , even more than a decade in some cases . so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist .

This course is great . The teachers provide excellent exposition of the problems , the formalization , and the solution concepts of generic agents and types of agents acting simultaneously , sequentially in games with complete and incomplete information . The math required is middle school probability calculation and equations .

The videos and explanations are very poor . Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script , and everything feels fake .

The lectures were not very interesting or instructive . The reading materials were much more so . However , the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self - reflection than on the materials . I learned a little bit , and as such found the course worth the time I put into it , but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials , and thus derive very little benefit from it . I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping . In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials , I think more real - life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition . )####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'NEG')]

There is a lot of self - teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions .

There is some good content on creativity in this course , thoug it barely addresses problem solving . Do something different " assingments were an interesting idea .

Very very helpful . Everyone should take this course ! We often work very hard on subjects but we lack the technique to learn something new so we tend to leave it imcomplete or complete it with not much satisfaction . This course teaches us how to utilize every single minute of your hard work and that too in a positive sense .####[([8], [0, 1, 2], 'POS'), ([8], [4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
Very helpful for absolutely beginners . The content is well - organized and materials are carefully picked to provide concise , easy - to - read information for learners . Lectures are clear , well - presented , just - right informative ; accompanied by the great public speaking skill of the instructor , they are hence not intimidating or boring at all . Another plus point is the instructor constantly urging learners to go beyond " the passing point " and learn more on their own , which is a very key mindset to keep up with the fast , ever - changing landscape of Information Technologies . Don ' t feel lost or scared , since she ' ll provide you with great resources for further learning and references !####[([7], [9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([13], [15, 16], 'POS'), ([13], [19], 'POS'), ([13], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([30], [32], 'POS'), ([30], [34, 35, 36], 'POS'), ([30], [38, 39, 40, 41], 'POS'), ([52], [46, 47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([52], [70, 71, 72], 'POS'), ([52], [121, 122, 123, 124, 125], 'POS'), ([30], [57, 58, 59, 60], 'POS')]
I did not know anything about Ruby or Rails before this course . I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion : Ruby , Rails , Rspec , all other tools . However , I think the coverage of the unit testing concepts was really useful . I had to go for google quite many times to find out resolve issues I had with the tools and assignments . But in the end , I think this course was a good one , rating it 4 out of 5 starts .####[([11], [17, 18], 'POS'), ([11], [54, 55], 'POS'), ([11], [90], 'POS'), ([11], [95, 96, 97, 98, 99], 'POS'), ([11], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'POS')]
This is an exceptional course . The quality of the lectures – course content , lecturing approach , and audiovisual production – is top - notch . Randy Picker provides a fascinating , engaging look at various devices and platforms , starting with their history and then integrating legal considerations , particularly under antitrust and copyright law . He presents the material in an easily comprehensible and digestible way , and explores subjects ( and objects ) that are very relevant in the modern , connected , digitized , and ( borrowing a word from this class ) mediated world .

I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy . I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson ( reading - > video ) and the entire course . I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing each case . Perhaps , an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in - video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos . However , where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section . There was no authority answering any questions whatsoever , not content related nor operational .####[([3], [6, 7], 'POS'), ([36], [39, 40], 'POS'), ([36], [43], 'POS'), ([72, 73, 74, 75], [70, 71], 'NEU'), ([3], [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106], 'NEU'), ([3], [110, 111, 112, 113, 114], 'NEG'), ([3], [15, 16, 17, 18], 'POS'), ([26], [15, 16, 17, 18], 'POS'), ([36], [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'POS')]
After being bored to death by his first highly complex and involved analytical / historical lectures , I skipped over every video that Prof . Germano lectured in .

This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments .

I thoroughly enjoyed this course . It was a narrowly - defined topic ( Questionnaire Design ) that was well - explored ; this makes the course feel like you are actually learning something and does not feel overwhelming in the slightest .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise . But overall , those two annoyances would not keep me from taking another course from UC San Diego or the instructors behind the course .####[([1], [3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([1], [56, 57, 58], 'NEG'), ([67, 68], [63, 64], 'NEG'), ([1], [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 'POS')]
The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[([1], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([1], [7, 8, 9, 10], 'POS'), ([1], [35], 'POS'), ([1], [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS'), ([47], [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55], 'NEU'), ([73, 74], [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'NEG'), ([105], [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117], 'NEG'), ([105], [130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135], 'NEG'), ([148], [151, 152, 153, 154, 155], 'NEG'), ([148], [168, 169], 'NEG'), ([1], [176, 177, 178], 'POS'), ([1], [184, 185, 186], 'NEG')]
The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected . For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria . The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous . There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over .####[([4], [6], 'POS'), ([10], [12, 13], 'NEG'), ([21], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], 'NEG'), ([10], [48, 49, 50, 51, 52], 'NEG'), ([59], [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67], 'NEG'), ([59], [74], 'NEG'), ([59], [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92], 'NEG')]
Lectures and other material just don ' t cover the information needed in the course project . Majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course , in order to pass the course project .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) . I would love to see a follow - up module on that topic !####[([13], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([13], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([13], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([13], [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], 'NEG')]

Course had good structure , the videos were informative and really encouraging to go and start moving , from simple things like stretching at home or in your office to more sophisticated activites like sports or dance . Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way – it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) – every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity . I thought this course will be just fun , you know , everyone knows that sitting too much is bad etc . , but it really worked for me as a motivation to set some goals and get moving .

I miss a few things like giving you tools and social business plans but I believe that they will come in the next courses .####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([39], [38], 'POS'), ([4], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], 'NEU')]

As the second course in the specialization , I continue to find the material covered to be useful and fairly easy to learn . Between the first and second course , I feel like both courses were able to lay and build upon a foundation of knowledge with each chapter covered .

For a beginner , this course was a challenge in comparison to the other three base parts of Craft of Writing , but as a result of the challenge , it is by far the most rewarding as well . The concepts discussed , and the material provides the learners with both broad perspective into several topics that I would argue to be crucial in becoming a writer , and also a deep look at some very key concepts to writing . I would recommend taking this course last of the four , before beginning the Capstone project - if you ' re planning on going through all the parts .

It has been a memorable experience ! I thought that I knew all about Rock ' n ' Roll until I was introduced to the course that was put together by University of Rochester ! Well I was wrong !

Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course . Being a true beginner w / no background in programming or data science , I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises ( which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate ) and lectures . I spent 8 - 12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in . I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([7], [4], 'NEG'), ([26, 27], [29, 30, 31, 32, 33], 'NEG')]

I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class .

This is a great introductory course . The course materials are carefully organized , to avoid lengthy mathematical content , yet conveying the key idea of machine learning .

From the basic layout of the course you would assume it ' s for beginners since it covers step - by - step instructions to install software and run command on command line window . But on the other hand , many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction . I remember in one class , " data dredging " is discussed for about 2 - 3 minutes . But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is , instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind , you would run the risk of data dredging .

The material covers all the right topics for an up and coming web designer , providing the right amount of information for a confident start and plenty of pointers where and how to expand on the knowledge provided .

I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation . Also , the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete . This is good because if what the activity desn ' t really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you ' ve learned . However , as I ' ve said , if what you ' re being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn ' t all that practical . I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you ' ve learned and whether you ' ve retained the information or not .####[([12], [15, 16], 'NEG')]
I enjoyed this course immensely ! I was a bit hesitant due to its length , however , the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting . A couple of the weeks , the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry . Also , I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation . I feel as though I didn ' t really understand those concepts until watching that week ' s as well as the next week ' s lectures . Finally , the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn ' t match well to what the instructors actually said .####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([3], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([34], [36, 37], 'NEG'), ([3], [67, 68, 69, 70, 71], 'NEG')]
I worked really hard on this course , but was stymied by a couple of quizzes . If I could not answer one question correctly , it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions , meaning that I could not pass quiz . With no recourse , I was prevented from passing although my overall percentage of points earned was passing . I would still like to pass , as I feel that I really earned the certificate . I would really like a chance to speak to someone who can help me resolve my questions . My other problem was using one of the models , which I never could master , despite reading the help sites and trying two or more times .####[([15], [10], 'NEG')]

I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class , but I don ' t feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime . The class was challenging , but mostly for the wrong reasons . I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning .

The course material and the instructor ' s lectures are excellent . However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly - - marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often .

I really liked this course . I have owned and trained dogs from a very early time in my life . I found it very interesting how dogs evolved from wolves and how that is apparent in dogs today . I typically like courses to be heavy on the science side , but this class was well presented for mid - level people or people who don ' t have a science background .

Course was great . I completed it at my own pace and enjoyed most subjects covered thoroughly . My favourite week was about Metaethics .

Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics , it is definitely just an introductive class . In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material . The following are my notes and suggestions : - - I found the lectures highly redundant , with many unnecessary repetitions - - using a vector notation ( like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters ) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable - - too much hand writing on the slides while talking : a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable - - very very poor video editing ( many times it ' s clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut ! ! ) - the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology , which would be more correct and easier to understand . Just realize that ML is basically applied math , and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject####[([4], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 'POS'), ([4], [18, 19, 20, 21], 'NEU'), ([34], [30, 31], 'NEG'), ([49], [50, 51], 'NEG'), ([49], [54, 55, 56], 'NEG'), ([95], [89, 90, 91, 92], 'NEG'), ([137], [121, 122, 123, 124, 125], 'NEG'), ([95], [170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177], 'NEG')]

It was a very interesting course , however it was biased toward Spanish history with the inclusions . I was really more interested in what I thought the course was supposed to be about anyway , Medieval Manuscripts . I had a terrible time deciphering the lecturer ' s English and , because I ' m not interested in a course certificate , the course projects were a waste of my time , though I can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course .####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([46], [42, 43, 44], 'NEG'), ([46], [49], 'NEG'), ([64, 65], [68, 69, 70, 71], 'NEG'), ([64, 65], [81], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [83, 84, 85, 86], 'POS')]
This is a really hard course for an intermediate player . But it is an outstanding course , and it is amazing , if you think about it , to have hours of free access to Gary Burton . Students of Jazz will enjoy it , but it requires advanced chord theory , the ability to sight read , and a damned good ear to follow along . Some of the materials are strictly by sound , so if you can ' t follow chord changes you might be lost . That said , this course helped me improve my playing in several ways .

This class has been inspirational and informative to me ! It gives me strategies and tools to overcome some of the things that have impeded my constant learning .

The videos are clear , easy to follow and with plenty of examples , great information and content . Lots of material and sources to read , actually in my case not enough time to read it . The teacher YaaKov is a great instructor , his assignments are written in great detail and very clear steps , so is easy to comprehend and execute . The teacher as well as the teaching staff always answer promptly and in depth your questions or comments in the forum .

It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer . Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough . Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit . Some problems and applications above and beyond the starter kit ' s intro guide would be nice and appropriate for the course . Additionally , given that this is also supposed to be an intro to C , a bit more detail and some programmatic problem solving in C would have also added good value to the course .####[([13, 14], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([13, 14], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([28], [31, 32], 'POS'), ([28], [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], 'NEU')]

Very good basic course for everyone interested in the European Union . Here you can learn about the past and the present state of affairs in the EU , as well as get to know some future challenges . The course is filled with lots of EU - related facts and statistics and presents the EU from different points of view . I would say the course is quite a " light " one : there are no peer - reviewed assignments and quizzes are rather short and easy , but it definitely gives food for thought .

Much harder than I thought . Very in - depth introductory learning of python . Preferably better if you allow scripting in . py because notebook is rather heavy and hard todebug while assignments .

I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities , but this course is clearly biased . The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest .

I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class .

It is a wonderful course for serious learners wanting to learn about the human nervous system and how it works . I myself am a medical doctor ( I graduated over two years ago ) and I can attest that ( in my university at least ) I didn ' t have neuroscience lectures with this depth and detail . Due to my medical background I found it comfortable to go through the course without much effort or lots of extra studying . But I figure that if you do not have some such foundation it might be a bit more challenging to go smoothly with the course , and you might needs more extra studying and more time put into the course . But if you are interested about neuroscience and want to learn the essentials of how the human brain works ( as per our current knowledge ) then I recommend that you put in the effort and go with the course even if you don ' t have a strong background in the life sciences or in medicine .

The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught . Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose .

Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion . The discussion forum does not work as intended . There is too much noise . They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated . It all seems rushed and not rewarding .

This course is a must for students and teachers alike . As a final year neuroscience PhD candidate I expected to know by now how to learn , yet I got a wealth of advice and new insights .

Overall very detailed and informative . A great way to get insight into English Common Law .

Very interesting , up - to - date and relevant concepts on marketing and communication tools and how they relate to the fundamental goal of achieving long - term brand loyalty . I like the practical examples used as they help to illustrate the concepts well . If a little more coverage could be provided on digital marketing , it would be great .

I can only infer that this course ' s target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities . Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples , watching the videos at 2x speed . The course itself is incredibly shallow , even for a survey course , and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors ' own products - - Graphlab Create . You ' ll be much better off taking Andrew Ng ' s course , which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library .

The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python , I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically . Where it falls down though is the assignment auto - grader . It ' s immensely fussy ( as I understand it has to be ) , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don ' t sufficiently explicitly define whats expected . This means you spend more than 50 % of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so .

This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason . The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses .

I learned a lot . This is a tough course , quizes are not trivial and the last HW was a huge amount of work . The videos are excellent . The professor goes slow , the visual aides are great and there are several impressive videos of drones doing impressive cool stuff . Only downside is that I would say it ' s harder than advertised . Also , there are some red herrings disguised as hints in the HW write ups that you have to be careful of before going down unnecessary rabbit holes .####[([9], [8], 'NEG'), ([11], [13, 14], 'NEG'), ([18], [21, 22, 23, 24], 'NEG'), ([27], [29], 'POS'), ([32], [33, 34], 'POS'), ([37, 38], [40], 'POS'), ([27], [45], 'POS'), ([9], [64, 65, 66], 'NEG')]
People use Python for many purposes : to make games , build web services , to solve business problems , to work with sensors , drivers and robots . Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work . Python is an incredibly efficient language : your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require . Py4inf and Python explained by C . Servance , is a great developing of the foundations in programming ( first two courses ) that will serve you well for the rest of your life , as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you . I strongly recommend this course for anybody , who wants to start with informatics .####[([107], [79], 'POS'), ([107], [117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124], 'POS'), ([107], [129, 130], 'POS')]

This was so far the best free online course I have done . Great videos in which Dr . Vázquez - Cognet well explained the Microeconomics Principles , in a lively interactive way while using good examples from a daily life . The weekly multiple choice quiz which could be repeated ( varying the questions ) until the subject is fully undertood and minimum score met also contributed to a good understanding of the subject .

I had a lot of fun during this course , but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail . Furthermore , I took this course without doing the prior courses in the specialization , and there were a couple of moments when I really thought previous knowledge from a different course was required . I think for the most part the lecturers did a great job in explaining the materials in the course . The lectures themselves were also well structured , and the topics followed each other in a logical order .

After the first week , the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums .

Great course first of all . One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures . The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift , which are really useful , but they are not comprehensive enough . So for most of the students , I believe , will have to do a lot of self - studying to finish the final project . But still , the final project is challenging and interesting . Swift is not a hard language to learn , so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming , I was able to finish the project .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([20], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([20], [36, 37, 38], 'NEG'), ([1], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], 'NEG'), ([70, 71], [73], 'POS'), ([70, 71], [75], 'POS')]
At this point , I think that the course is good , however there should be more reviews . Three reviews of people who is also learning is not enough , in my opinion . I have received some comments like ' some sentences are not good ' . Which tells me absolutely nothing . I think people should be encouraged to exemplify what they mean , to take the sentences that they believe that are wrong , and extend why . For the rest , the course is very good .####[([8], [10], 'POS'), ([8], [89, 90], 'POS')]

he course was challenging , and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures , and a bit more practice on using the basic functions , I learned a lot . I thought the video lectures were a little sparse . here were only 20 - 30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit . More examples in video lectures would have helped . I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture . So overall , the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python ( but moderately experienced in C programming ) , and although I would have liked a bit more guidance , I learned a lot .####[([1], [3], 'POS'), ([24], [22, 23], 'NEU'), ([39, 40], [43, 44], 'NEG'), ([55, 56], [53], 'NEG'), ([61], [75, 76, 77], 'POS'), ([101], [105], 'NEU'), ([119], [121], 'POS'), ([17, 18], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'NEG')]

I am enjoying this course very much , it is informative and very well organized and presented . I highly recommend it to anyone with an internet in the topic as it provides an excellent overview and includes current academic and non academic ( mass media , world leaders . etc ) . perspectives .

This was a very good intro course . Some additions that could be applied may include : describing different types of motions ( interrogatives , cross motions ) ; types of judgments ( proscriptions , summary judgments , enjoinment ) , types of memoranda , or even a FOIA request . Maybe a look into work product privilege , protected documentation , principles of discovery . And finally , a little intro into the art of using case law as an event or test , for example ; in " Miranda " , " Keller " , " Brown " , or the " McDonnell Douglas test " . I understand this is just an intro , but if these things could be fit in somehow that would be cool .####[([6], [3, 4], 'POS')]

This is a pretty good intro to Excel course . It gets a little patchy in Weeks 3 and 4 ( it seems like some of the worksheets weren ' t checked for errors ) , but it never wastes your time . It ' s a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonly - used professional functions in Excel . I ' m glad I took it , though I do wish there had been more of a progression . For example , it would have been nice if there was a final , project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in Week 4 .####[([7, 8], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([7, 8], [13, 14], 'NEU'), ([7, 8], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([27], [28, 29, 30, 31], 'NEU'), ([7, 8], [69], 'POS')]

Great course series that forced me to take some steps ( design docs ) that I ' d normally skimp on , and in doing so , realizing their true value . Throughout Coursera I ' d love to see more instructor involvement in the courses . The 100 % peer review system is a double edge sword .

This course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in Unity , something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the Internet . The professor explains concepts behind why you need to use certain components instead of just giving a list of things to match up to replicate the projects . I ' ve rated it 4 out of 5 stars not based on the content , but because the response time , interaction , and feedback could be improved upon . The content is definitely 5 of 5 . I took this during the first run of the course , so I ' m sure that the course staff will improve on this in the future once they get a bit more used to running a MOOC on Coursera .####[([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS'), ([39], [92, 93, 94, 95], 'NEU'), ([98], [100, 101, 102, 103], 'POS'), ([1], [3, 4, 5, 6], 'POS')]
Highly recommend to take this as your first MOOC course . Very easy to understand , all topics discuss are presented in an easy , painless manner . The professors have very informative and brief video lectures , and taking the questions and quizzes right after the lectures is very helpful in staying engaged without using up too much of your time .

Most of coursera courses I have taken I am not able to complete , it is easy to drop off , not feel engaged , not able to complete the assignments on time . This course had the perfect balance - it had structure easy to follow weeks schedule and quizes . It provided additional reading and articles if needed to dive deeper . It also was a well rounded course with theory , interviews of experienced people from the industry , videos on practical experiments and summarizes of researches done on the field . I would highly recommend this course to any friend and would look forward to completing more with the same professor in same related topic .####[([35], [38, 39], 'POS'), ([35], [44], 'POS'), ([35], [61, 62], 'POS'), ([70], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([100], [97, 98], 'POS'), ([2], [16, 17, 18, 19], 'NEG'), ([2], [9, 10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]

While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course . I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources .

The last assignment of the course is , compared to the others , more difficult . In my case , I ran into several errors which I couldn ' t get help in solving by using the course Forum , as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead . I had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using Spark framework ( nor any of the other " Big Data " tools explored in the course ) . I also found some of the videos by PhD . Amarnath Gupta were difficult to understand , his examples were unclear and , in my opinion , too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread .####[([2], [13, 14], 'NEU'), ([38], [27, 28, 29, 30, 31], 'NEG'), ([94, 95, 96, 97], [99], 'NEG'), ([94, 95, 96, 97], [106], 'NEG'), ([44], [113, 114, 115, 116], 'NEG')]
The most weak part is automatical grading . When structure and semantics are essential , text inside tag is not , guessing if exists space between elements isn ' t acceptable as well .

For me also not enough accent was on html 5 features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes .####[([6], [1, 2], 'NEG')]

The best course I had on coursera . It is a comprehensive overview of current biotechnological techniquess and their established and potential results . The course keeps a shrewd balance between giving scientific information and looking at the broader more complex implications for society . You might think at times that the professor is not a scientist but a philosopher as well . The course is taught superbly by both professor and assistant , not one extra word , and not one word missing given the choice of topics . I think most of what is taught here should ideally be known by the majority of all people , in order to make more informed and thoughtful choices about life , as well as understanding what will happen in the next decades .####[([2], [1], 'POS'), ([52], [61], 'POS'), ([70, 71, 72], [67], 'POS')]

A good entry level course on modern and contemporary art . The themed approach works well and the artists are chosen carefully to give a broad overview of the subject .

I like this course , but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff . Ie , in JSON for me was confusing to hear " a list of dictionaries " .

This has been an exceptional course . I have really enjoyed it as an introductory course to Korean , because it does a good job of teaching the basics without trenching too much in the details .

In terms of Theory for General Software Architecture this Course is a good refresher for a person who is working with Software Architecture already .

The course was great . The tasks were a bit more complex than the ones from the first course , but they are still very fun . In the final assignment I was marked down on one aspect .

It touches upon a rather complex area of research but has masterly conveyed the essential skills and methods in a pace that is a bit challenging but not to a point of intimidating .

This i believe is a very good introduction into Functional programming . This course was a lot harder to what I initially expected . If you are used to languages like Java or C # you have to completely rethink the way you are used to approach problems . I had to do a lot more extra work and reading and do extra examples to understand some of the new concepts - but it is worth the effort .####[([13], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([13], [16, 17], 'POS')]
I highly appreciate having the opportunity of taking this course . The concepts and techniques I have learnt so far have helped me really improved in my University life as a student and in my work as an En glish teacher . I have taken so long to be able to finish it , but I have also taken my time to double check the video - lessons and take notes , so I can better understand . My purpose is to complete the whole course because I do not know what other wonderful experiences are awaiting to be discovered .

I am mixed on this class . I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms . But I don ' t feel like it ' s helping me become effective at using them . The course would get a higher rating if it focused more on practical applications , and not so heavy on the algebra .

Well , after the regression course , which I actually found interesting , the classification course doesn ' t look so good . The programming assignments are mostly pointless .

Very generic advice although the interviews with children ' s writers were illuminating and helpful . The marking system was inaccurate , for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn ' t ! Good , solid advice about setting character , scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer ' s block . The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience . Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist .####[([17, 18], [20], 'NEG'), ([66], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([100], [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84], 'NEG')]

A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements . While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks . Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow . Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use , but it ' s somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and " code - hiding " . Still , I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next .####[([18, 19], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68], 'NEG'), ([18, 19], [87], 'POS'), ([18, 19], [99, 100, 101, 102], 'POS')]

Good course on the whole , learned a lot and enjoyed it , but it would need to be updated and corrected ( certain bits of code don ' t work as they did when the course was produced , which can be pretty confusing ) . Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed , and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful .

Not a beginner course . You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab .

This is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on Coursera at the time of this review . I have taken all of the courses in the series from Copenhagen Business School , as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions . This specific course on Strategic Management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options . It does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation , but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy , and is of value to any business minded individual .

Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed , even if you submit before deadline .

This was a really good course ! I thoroughly enjoyed it . The only feedback that I have is to introduce vocabulary before using them in the practice conversations . Otherwise , really informative .

Good content but would have preferred if it was more interactive . There is no way to discuss in detail and debate over a topic . I still have many questions unanswered and forum is very inactive .

Good class , knowledgeable professor . I would have preferred if some of the longer sessions ( closer to 20 minutes ) were split into two sessions .

As others have said , the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials . However , the capstone project was a waste of time . Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me . In addition , the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1 / 3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all . This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses . I expected a lot more from a Wharton - led course - very disappointing .####[([8], [10], 'POS'), ([8], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [29, 30, 31], 'NEG'), ([8], [102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107], 'NEG'), ([8], [127, 128], 'NEG')]

For me , a really nice combination of1 . a theoretical overview of database and data processing concepts , MapReduce and the most important implementations of the various concepts ( SQL and NoSQL databases ) , 2 . practical application of these concepts in real - world programming exercises . I like the way Bill explains , and I like the exercises - however , to complete those , you need to be ready to learn the technology on your own , the lectures are NOT about learning the technology ( Python programming etc . ) to do the exercises . For me , that ' s fine , but for people who have little or no programming experience it might be frustrating .

In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming . That ' s very little value for money . The final course project again feels like it ' s done in a rush and without another review : The submitted dataset should be automatically checked .

Was a little too basic . Would have preferred more flesh ( both implementational and mathematical ) on the bones . I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly " this is for the experts in linear algebra " . Come on !

This course gives general information on the magic of middle ages .

The " Soul Beliefs " course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias .

This course has been an eye opener for me , I truly enjoyed it . It gives you basic knowledge of what it takes to be a good public speaker , and you can apply this knowledge not only in presentations , but also in your daily life .

Beware this course , especially if you are new to this area ( despite what the course / specialization says ) . There are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course , but what ' s worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos , so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignments / projects satisfactorily or smoothly .

The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data . The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code . The auto - grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect . The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data , the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer . Admittedly , I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer .####[([1], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([72], [97, 98, 99], 'NEG'), ([1], [108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117], 'POS'), ([72], [120], 'NEG'), ([1], [146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154], 'POS')]
Not up to the standard of the previous two courses . The material was already covered in the first course - Fundamentals of Graphic Design - and nothing new was brought to the table .

Good course , very well structured , well signposted , progressive , very clear , with a good use of the media . As for the content , the examples are not always well connected to the theory .

Unlike the very first course for beginners , there is a little bit more content here , so I put 2 stars .

It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses , not 5 ( with the capstone ) .

The problems are interesting , the course is great .

The courses are great . I enjoyed them a lot . I have one comment on the JavaScript topics though . Key concepts like JavaScript objects , closures , module pattern and Immediately Invoked Functions are not covered . I understand that JavaScript is a very broad subject but a quick review of those key points would be great for a student to continue reading further on its own .####[([42], [36, 37], 'NEG')]

Professor Severance is awesome . I really like how each video is an in - depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when . I think his sense of what ' s important is spot on as I ' ve already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects , the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter . The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned . I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week ' s material , especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more .

Excellent lectures , let down by the difficulty of the assignments . While the tutors clearly know their stuff , I found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new ( to me ) mathematics or CS that also needed to be grasped .

The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures . This was a little unfair .

Thank you to the instructors and the university ! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader ( institutional and cultural ) framework in which they are produced . I would have rated it 4 . 5 starts if possible , but as halves are not possible I give it 4 . Possible improvements : - the delivery of the course can be a bit livier , smoother ; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format - while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this , sometimes simply mentioning ' lists ' of directors , movies , series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming , hard to relate to - students ' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments####[([4], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([12], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([12], [48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([4], [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'NEG'), ([12], [80, 81, 82, 83], 'NEU')]

Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about . Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam , its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind . Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic . Some questions on quizzes weren ' t explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week . Other than that , a solid course .####[([3], [2], 'POS'), ([75], [77, 78, 79], 'NEG'), ([75], [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92], 'NEG'), ([104], [105, 106, 107, 108], 'NEG'), ([3], [132], 'POS')]

This course was truly an excellent way to learn about Einstein ' s Special Theory of Relativity . The content covered most of the main aspects of Special Relativity , and the instructor did a top notch job of explaining how the various aspects of the theory are derived and many implications of the Theory . The maths involved in this course is no more than high - school level algebra with a few tricks , and as such the course should be within most people ' s reach with a bit of effort . Mind you , the concepts themselves are somewhat counter - intuitive , so be prepared to think a lot about the implications . However , all that being said , I highly recommend this course !

We are getting basic ideas , but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly , with NO examples / limited examples , which is what will teach us the most .

I entered this course with no coding experience , and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it . The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R , and the projects are a great playground of R ' s different capabilities , but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures . That being said , this course ' s difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming .

It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works it ' s clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course ) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done . further to the course timeframe ) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions , which is very strange in a course for coaching . Not the mention video quality that is scary , I could not watch the videos , and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([1], [76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83], 'NEG'), ([1], [94, 95], 'NEG'), ([121], [164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171], 'NEG'), ([186], [187, 188, 189, 190], 'NEG')]

The information in the course was really excellent and was set up in a way that it wasn ' t overwhelming . I wish I could give four and a half only because some of the videos explaining procedures were really long and were obsolete , and also because different parts of the site would say that I needed to submit something and others would say that everything was received so it made me really nervous - at one point the site was telling me that I was late in submitted my work and that I ' d need to sign up for a later class but it turns out my assignments had been submitted and graded before the cut off time so that alert just really frazzled me if anything .####[([4], [6, 7], 'POS'), ([4], [17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([36], [37, 38, 39, 40, 41], 'NEG'), ([36], [44], 'NEG')]

This is a fantastic course ! While the content is reasonably technical , it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience . The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow . I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to ! it ' s a good course , helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english . The only problem that i find whit this course isn ' t about the course it ' s about the peer to peer grading , is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes , not in all cases . Also is a short course , the assignments are very simple and that makes it an easy going course , i would recommend it for intermmediate english stundents .####[([4], [3], 'POS'), ([8], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([4], [24, 25, 26, 27, 28], 'POS'), ([37], [45, 46, 47, 48, 49], 'POS'), ([37], [51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([4], [84, 85], 'POS')]
Besides an engaging instructor ( Brandon Skyhorse ) , the modules ' content is accessible for nascent writers . Moreover , I enjoy the shop talk series with authors .

Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures . I ' d placed in the " advance beginner " or " intermediate low " level , therefore , you need to have previous knowledge of Python .

The lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical . Pretty good . Everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create . Not so great , I think .

You have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and I didn ' t think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that .

The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material , which can still be understood by non - CS students . It ' s very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB / Octave programming assignments . After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions . Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture . I still don ' t have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain , but it feels like the course doesn ' t miss anything of the fundamentals .

The video classes are informative and very clear . The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace .

Nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering . The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome . Outside of the necessary downloads , recordings , playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear .

This is a great course that is very informative . It brought many performers to my attention that I had not heard of before or that I had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music .

It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music , but does not feature the music itself .

The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice . There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with , yet this is a pivotal point in education .

Something else to reinforce the material cause it seems a bit condensed . thanks for a wonderful course !####[([1], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([23, 24, 25, 26], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([23, 24, 25, 26], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'POS'), ([49], [40], 'POS'), ([49], [44], 'POS'), ([49], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([1], [75, 76, 77], 'POS'), ([94], [95, 96, 97, 98, 99], 'NEG'), ([94], [130, 131, 132, 133], 'NEG'), ([1], [135, 136, 137, 138], 'POS')]
The course takes a broad approach to the subject . What I miss : the study material should provide more and better organized ( theoretical ) information ( e . g . on topcis like database design , data structures , etc . ) What I like : presenting of current software projects around big data####[([1], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([16], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG'), ([1], [48, 49, 50, 51, 52], 'POS')]
It´s a great course to understand and to learn the princoples of Machine Learning and its methods and algorithms . The teacher is absolute wonderful because I knows how to explain the complex concepts and theory in an easy way . Definitely , he is a great teacher . It has been hard , and took me more time than expected , but I am really happy for having completed it .

This my first machine learning course and I am very satisfied with it . The bottom - up approach really helped me understand how machine learning evolve . I only cannot understand the proper action to do if I have to use data mining application as modern data mining applications provide diverse algorithms .

Because of this course , I am more aware of opportunities to negotiate in my every day interactions with others . I enjoyed Professor Siedel ' s teaching style . He gets you to think on a deeper level , especially when he poses questions and presents scenarios . The course material is framed in a comprehensive manner .

Very interesting subject matter , and I learned a lot . My biggest complaint is that many of the programming exercises have errors in them that haven ' t been fixed , despite this course having been running for years . This always left me wondering if an incorrect output was an error on my part , or an error in the provided code . Still , I thoroughly enjoyed the course as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a foundation in machine learning .####[([34], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([34], [7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([19, 20], [22], 'NEG'), ([34], [68, 69], 'POS'), ([34], [77, 78], 'POS')]

Great course . my constructive criticism has to do with the organizing of the group activities , it ' s just very difficult to organize into groups via people whom you have not met , especially given the time zone differences as well the differences in daily schedules for group members . I just wonder if there ' s a possibility to organize the group projects in such a way that the website allows for better asynchronous work ( not just emailing back and forth as that feels very disorganized ) ? Otherwise I feel that I learned a lot and I feel that this is a great intro class . i ' ve learned tons of new things . i would like to have more materials on the subject . could the staff attach some recommended readings ? other courses ? than you for making this course : )####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [97, 98, 99], 'POS'), ([1], [107, 108], 'POS'), ([1], [114, 115, 116, 117, 118], 'POS'), ([126], [122, 123, 124, 125], 'NEG')]
Great case study , but the way to engage the audience might have been way better . Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power , because they were quite boring . Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment . Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization . Capstone should have been done by the same ( high ) standards as other courses in specialization .####[([17], [23, 24], 'NEG'), ([17], [35, 36], 'NEG'), ([53], [55, 56], 'NEG'), ([53], [58], 'NEG')]
This is a very interesting and rewarding course . It would help if the format was broken up a bit more . Perhaps with some video of power plants , turbines , etc .

An in - depth survey of perhaps most of the current techniques in machine learning . Very well presented , in a well - paced and understandable fashion .

It is the first course I have successfully completed on Coursera . I had a vague background in programming from my undergraduate studies in Engineering , but I have always wanted to learn more .

Week 3 application assignment is buggy . If you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect . You must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for .

Very dynamic and didactic . The way Dr . BArbara Oakley and Dr .

I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway .

Great class ! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging . My only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand .

I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general .

Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning . However , as the models get more complicated , some of the material isn ' t really explained very well , specially the last module about ' deep learning ' is quite superfluous .

Great subject and some very well presented videos . However there were several which were incomprehensible .

I enjoyed this course and recommend it . Prof . Fowler is very didatic and funny , and makes the classes nice to watch . I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given , and the support is not that perfection yet , but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance ( in my case , I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard . . . they were true mentors ) . Anyway , if you have some interest in series , I am sure you will enjoy this course .####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([3], [5], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [12, 13, 14, 15], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([30], [32, 33], 'NEG'), ([8, 9, 10], [41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'NEG'), ([57], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([3], [101], 'POS')]
Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[([6], [25, 26, 27, 28], 'NEG'), ([6], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([6], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'NEG'), ([6], [51], 'POS'), ([6], [53, 54], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [75], 'POS'), ([63, 64], [77, 78], 'POS')]
This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students . This has got to be the worst Coursera course I have taken and I have taken quite a few .####[([4], [3], 'NEG'), ([17], [19], 'NEG'), ([22], [33, 34], 'NEG'), ([4], [54, 55], 'NEG'), ([4], [82, 83, 84], 'NEG'), ([4], [104], 'NEG'), ([9], [10, 11, 12], 'NEG')]
Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[([4], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([7, 8, 9], [20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([46], [38, 39, 40], 'NEG'), ([46], [82, 83], 'NEG')]
