A five - week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans . The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system , differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music , biological interpretation of scales , and the impact of cultural differences onto music . The course is rather a prolonged description of the research field than a proper part of general education . Its real subject is certain topics in biology , not music . Only a number facts discussed may be of interest for most music student , and these are contained in any decent introductory textbook of music anyhow .####[([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75], 'POS'), ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'NEG')]

Very well taught and complete introduction to Unity3d and Game Development . I ' m a Unity developer since 2010 and i can say this course covers all the topics in a nice and clean , structured way .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) . I would love to see a follow - up module on that topic !####[([13], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([13], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([13], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([13], [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], 'NEG')]
A little basic for me . But it was mentioned this was meant for the absolute beginner . Nonetheless , as a developer that never dabbled in HTML , this dipped my curiosity for HTML5 .

The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python . That being said , the lectures were absolutely useless .

I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr . Fredrickson refers to are for the most part only touched on briefly ) , and to have spent less time listening to the on - site students discussing their personal opinions ( though I appreciated their insights , I would have liked to have learned more actual information ) . I did get something out of the experiential activities . Although they are optional , I would recommend doing them to really get something out of the class . They allowed me to stop and think about things I may not have made the time for otherwise .####[([5], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'POS'), ([5], [103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109], 'POS')]

I ' ve enjoyed this course greatly , and look forward to delve further into philosophy . I loved all of the talks by all the lecturers , and found their follow - up videos to be particularly helpful . Unfortunately , that also meant that there was no forum to access and discuss the questions posed by the lectures with other people taking the course , which I believe would have helped to hone my argumentative skills , which I believe is necessary to have ( and further develop and enhance ) , when learning about philosophy . Thank you very much for this amazing course .

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts " triangular theory of love " and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([8], [10, 11], 'POS'), ([8], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'POS'), ([8], [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([97], [98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103], 'NEG')]

The information is fascinating and the instructor is very interesting . It ' s a great course ! ! The only drawbacks are that there is so much reading to do ( but you can succeed in the course and only do as much of the reading as you want to ) and the 70 question final exam ( but given that you can take it as many times as you want you can get any grade that you ' re willing to put in the time for ) .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise .

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces . The programming assignments may require a learning curve for those who have never used a Matlab / Octave environment , especially using the vectorized operations instead of loops but that is also well worth the time and effort . If you check question - and - answer sites on the Internet , you will probably find that this is the most recommended beginning course for related branches of science and engineering .####[([9, 10], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'POS'), ([25, 26], [36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([44, 45], [74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80], 'POS')]

Very good course , but I did ' t like how the last week focused on test taking . The course should focus more on ' learning how to learn , ' not how to ace a test . In that regard , I felt the course began to be oriented more towards students rather than working adults .

This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop .

Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help .

I ' ve tried the Python course of Rice university , and some part of the Codecademy Python course !

Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed . That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook . In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting . Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB . If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book . The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .####[([49, 50], [47, 48], 'NEG'), ([55], [57, 58], 'NEG'), ([111], [113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120], 'NEG'), ([127], [125], 'NEG'), ([55], [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66], 'NEG')]

Excellent . Very comprehensive course that has relevance to academic research scientists and those with less scientific training .

I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy . I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson ( reading - > video ) and the entire course . I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing each case . Perhaps , an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in - video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos . However , where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section .

Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !####[([23, 24], [26, 27], 'POS'), ([23, 24], [34, 35, 36, 37], 'NEG'), ([46], [40, 41, 42, 43, 44], 'NEG'), ([46], [55, 56, 57], 'NEG'), ([69], [62, 63, 64, 65], 'NEG'), ([89], [91, 92, 93, 94], 'POS'), ([20], [128, 129, 130], 'NEG')]

I am super confident even with just two weeks into the course of coming out as a really skilled developer , and hopefully have a fairly advanced " developer ' s intuition " .

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake .

I am a programmer with legacy background and perl , I enrolled to this course so that I can mentor my juniors at work on python ; esp perl to python code conversion and attending this course is immensely satisfying from that objective . I will attend the other courses and probably build some materials so that I can cover the entire course 1 - 4 in a week . Thanks Dr .

A well - designed course that allows me to understand the web development concepts . Each section is clear and flows to the next section . A great teaching method that makes you think and try out the changes . It does not matter if you make mistakes , the tutor as your back , and provides the before and after source code .

The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined .

Save your money and just work through the free Galaxy 101 tutorials on the Galaxy site !

Also , the final peer reviewed project isn ' t explained very well and uses tools and methods that aren ' t even within the scope of the module .

I give this course 4 stars as I did learn a lot from it , and thought most of it is well prepared and useful .

An excellent course , Dr . Chuck manages to put various things with ease . Material as well as teaching is excellent .

I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues . Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study .####[([4], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([33], [28, 29], 'NEG'), ([50, 51], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62], 'NEG'), ([85], [83], 'POS'), ([85], [90, 91], 'POS'), ([96], [99, 100, 101], 'POS'), ([4], [121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133], 'NEU'), ([4], [138], 'POS')]

Some parts are needed more clarification . In other words , as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials , since the materials are not self - sufficient . Specially about simulation methods . However , this is not the reason that I give the course 4 out of 5 . The absence of any help from TAs , based on my experience , is the reason .

Short - to - the point , easily understandable , and challenging assignments , this is what I can say about this course .####[([2, 3, 4], [0, 1], 'POS'), ([15], [8, 9], 'POS'), ([15], [18, 19, 20, 21], 'POS'), ([15], [39, 40], 'POS'), ([15], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], 'POS'), ([44], [43], 'POS')]
The ideas are good , but I dislike the presentation . It ' s hard to read the screen and quotes when they ' re only on the screen for a few moments . Lengthy lists are presented , however , I need to pause the video if I want to know anything that ' s on the list beyond the first two points . These are often the only points explained . If one is only concerned with the spoken word , then you ' ll gather an okay amount of information .####[([9], [7], 'NEG'), ([9], [14, 15, 16], 'NEG'), ([9], [34, 35, 36, 37], 'NEG')]

A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course . Many were passed onto " look this up yourself " , which is fine , but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong . The group _ by stuff was especially tricky , as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example , eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns . Other than that , very interesting overall and very neat datasets . I would encourage having students check out kaggle . com for extra credit .####[([5], [4], 'NEG'), ([5], [7], 'NEG'), ([5], [9, 10], 'NEG'), ([5], [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], 'NEG'), ([13], [85, 86], 'POS'), ([13], [89, 90, 91], 'POS')]
A very comprehensive introduction , well structured and narrated . Video lectures were interesting and easy - to - follow . I liked the fact that TED talks and other video sources were used in the syllabus . Also , the course book is well written . My only addition to it would be to include more solution - based topics .####[([10, 11], [13], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 'POS'), ([41], [1, 2, 3], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [5, 6, 7, 8], 'POS'), ([42], [44, 45], 'POS')]
THIS Professor needs more than just his own Coursera module . He needs his own television show ! it stuck ! the information stuck . I took this class over a year ago and can still recall the case histories .####[([1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'NEG'), ([1], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG')]
This was the first course I opted to learn through coursera . And this course taught me to study my lessons in an effective and smart way . The way they presented this course and their approach was easy and understandable . As a student this course helped me a lot . Thanks a lot . This course motivated me to learn more courses too .####[([10], [6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([14], [23, 24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([14], [38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([14], [47, 48, 49, 50], 'POS'), ([14], [52, 53, 54], 'POS')]
Dr . Severance put in lot of efforts to make python easy for all the learners . This Course is about the basics of python . If you are a beginner , you will learn a lot of concepts very easily . For people who have a bit of programming knowledge in other languages , this will help in learning the syntax . Overall a good course to go through .####[([0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([10], [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 'POS'), ([10], [65], 'POS')]
Dr . Tompkin is one of the best professors I have had the pleasure to encounter . That is going some because I have two PhDs . He clearly and concisely explains important concepts , putting the subject matter within reach of anyone who is interested . I hope that he will offer more courses .####[([0, 1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7], 'POS'), ([0, 1, 2], [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], 'POS')]
Exceptional content . High level text , graphs and references . Prof . Sachs is a great lecturer ! So much we can learn from him and be better human beings .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'POS'), ([11, 12, 13], [28, 29, 30], 'POS')]
