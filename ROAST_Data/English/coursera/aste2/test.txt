I have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course - and one spread over 4 weeks . It is extremely basic , extremely general and extremely high level .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[([43], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57], 'POS'), ([43], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75], 'NEG'), ([43], [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90], 'POS'), ([119], [170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178], 'NEG')]

This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages . The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour . The assignments which comes later on can be a tad difficult for someone new to programming , but as the professor says , stick with it , solve it , and the feeling you get when you finish it is unparalleled .

This was a good overview of the services Google Cloud Platform offers . There were a few bugs with the quizzes , but overall it was put together well and had a lot of information for a short course . I think it is a good introductory - level course for a person who has some background in Data Science and cloud computing , but not much experience with Google Cloud Platform . The tutorials and exercises are quick walk - throughs that can be completed in 10 - 15 minutes each . They give you a feel for how the Google Cloud APIs work and what some of the capabilities are , but don ' t go into much depth .

It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship . It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once . More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well . It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business . Thank you to all the teaching faculty for this great learning experience .####[([115, 116], [110, 111], 'POS')]

Really a great course ! Covering a lot of details , but the most important point is that this course gives a big picture of different levels of understanding of the brain and minds .

Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months .

Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[([0], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'POS'), ([12], [13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEG'), ([12], [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'NEG'), ([60], [62, 63, 64], 'NEG'), ([12], [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], 'NEG'), ([60], [106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113], 'NEG')]
Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching .

The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected .

This course wasn ' t good . Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written , and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them .

The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents . Affirmations are most times not justified at all ( " incremental prototyping will yield a feature - rich and robust software " ) .

Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language .

I still plan to do them but being forced to do them to get a pass would help . Otherwise I really like what I learning and how its presented .

The course was really well presented , taught and clear , and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python , it actually helped me to do some research and learn new material .

Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge .

A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python . I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures .

The syllabus is adequate , suitable for introducing digital marketing . Videos are all right , with a good selection of interviewed professionals . Transcripts are very useful to have under the videos , however , there are mistyped and misheard words here and there .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge . Normally I prefer Lynda to Coursera for the assignments and the quizzes , but not in this case . . .####[([11], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG'), ([21], [26, 27, 28, 29, 30], 'NEG'), ([21], [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'NEG')]
Great course to attend ! It allowed me to discover machine learning algorithms and to see I use some variant of those algorithms in other mathematical problems in my job and studies .

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks .

As I recall the original Introduction to Python Dr . Chuck course which debuted 3 to 4 years back or so , was split into two . So this is is like the 2nd part of the original course ( split into 2 as it was deemed slightly overwhelming for beginners ) . With the properly adjusted pace of this class , even with knowledge of Arithmetic only and NO programming what so ever , you should do well in this class provided you make at least a moderate effort !####[([7], [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'POS'), ([7], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60], 'POS')]

I ' m currently starting week 3 of this and already I feel I have got a huge amount out of it .

The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics . But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared . The lectures are not well organized .

The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening . For an institution like the host institution , this is odd .

Not the greatest Python course in the world . Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized , technical issues are common , and the discussion forums do not offer much value , as you cannot discuss your code with your peers , and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful . The exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking - often it ' s enough to copy & paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around ! You ' re better of looking for other Python beginner courses on the Coursera platform , as well as on other platforms . The only thing I liked about the course were the interviews with people behind Python , but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging .####[([3], [0, 1, 2], 'NEG'), ([22, 23], [25, 26, 27, 28], 'NEG'), ([42, 43], [45, 46, 47, 48], 'NEG'), ([51], [53], 'NEG'), ([51], [56, 57, 58, 59, 60], 'NEG')]

I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance . Such as real financial close considerations in developed and emerging markets , early stage sub performance and restructuring as well as refinancing . I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects . There were highlights on impacts of Basel on long tenor financing , but more market considerations of new players and structures would have been invaluable .####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([3], [7, 8], 'NEU')]

This course has amazing information in the lectures , but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes , you will have to re - take quizzes a number of times , no matter how well you are taking notes .

All three parts ( html css and javascript ) covered by this course are well taught . It is targets beginners very well .

Also the quizzes , exercises and projects are well thought through and help a lot with understanding and learning .

I learned so much from this course ! It was amazing how Dr .

Excellent course with practical and fun examples . I ' m eager to try some of it at work ! Many thanks to Andrew Ng : intuition before theory , simple examples , rephrases ideas in different terms , and shows he has a lot of fun teaching this course .

Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good . The assignments are hard , you will need do research to accomplish then , but is the best way to learn .

The course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created .

This course is a very good refresher of the basics and Dr Whiteman has explained things very clearly and precisely . Moreover , If you ' re following the complete series of courses , you ' d have grasped a good command over stress analysis . However , in the last leg of this course , I felt that couple of cases with statically indeterminate structures should have been in more detail .

Dr . Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of " astronomy " . The slides were clear . The transcripts helped to reinforce the information , although probably done with vocalization software as there are many sentence fragments , homonyms for the actual word , etc . I did not see a date done but I would guess this course was constructed in 2013 - 2014 , so the information is certainly current .####[([0, 1, 2], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'POS'), ([26], [28], 'POS'), ([31], [32, 33, 34, 35, 36], 'POS'), ([71], [83, 84], 'POS')]
This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented . I ' m now eagerly waiting for an updated version of the course , since the recorded lectures are from late 2012 .####[([5], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([5], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([41], [28, 29], 'POS'), ([41], [93, 94, 95], 'POS')]
This is an outstanding introduction to lesson planning . It covers the subject in far more detail than did my graduate teaching course . I would have given 5 stars but still struggle a bit with the presentational style of the instructor . Don ' t let this put you off though as that is very much a personal opinion and the material is excellent . For those who have followed the earlier courses in the specialization , I should warn that this one is much more difficult , particularly for those without prior teaching experience , and far more practically based .####[([6, 7], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([6, 7], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'POS'), ([41], [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], 'NEG'), ([62], [64], 'POS')]

This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism . Yes , the assignments require immersing oneself in problems that have little to do with parallelism per se . But they are interesting , fun , and of course they nicely illustrate the concepts that are being imparted . Another excellent course by EPFL .####[([4], [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 'NEU'), ([50], [51, 52, 53, 54, 55], 'POS'), ([50], [69, 70, 71], 'POS'), ([50], [77, 78, 79, 80], 'POS'), ([4], [87], 'POS')]

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .####[([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([14], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 'NEG'), ([14], [60, 61, 62, 63], 'NEG'), ([92], [91], 'POS')]

This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments . I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the ins and outs of citations , which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course .

When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great .

This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste .

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .####[([5], [13, 14, 15], 'POS'), ([5], [39, 40, 41, 42, 43], 'NEU'), ([5], [83, 84], 'NEG'), ([5], [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], 'NEG'), ([5], [88, 89], 'POS')]

This course is not for beginner programmers .

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums .

The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science . At times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting . Will share these observations widely . We are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can .

The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[([1], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([1], [35], 'POS'), ([1], [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], 'POS'), ([47], [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55], 'NEU'), ([73, 74], [87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94], 'NEG'), ([105], [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117], 'NEG'), ([105], [130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135], 'NEG'), ([148], [151, 152, 153, 154, 155], 'NEG'), ([148], [168, 169], 'NEG'), ([1], [176, 177, 178], 'POS'), ([1], [184, 185, 186], 'NEG'), ([1], [7, 8, 9, 10], 'POS')]

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that .

Week 2 quiz I had to take multiple times and really couldn ' t figure out what the correct answer was . Looking at the discussion boards I believe my sentiment is shared .

I enjoyed the contents and homeworks . Overall the delivery was very good , and I have grasped a lot . The main reason that I won ' t give 5 stars is the program assignment .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 .

Excellent course . Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel . Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach & verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .

Course had good structure , the videos were informative and really encouraging to go and start moving , from simple things like stretching at home or in your office to more sophisticated activites like sports or dance . Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way – it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) – every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work .

Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr . Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested , and I could follow along easily , with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises , so as not to discourage me . I ' ve tried to learn computer programming using Java ( inside & outside of a tertiary environment ) with very limited success , but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive . So while i ' m not a complete " novice " to programming , this course had the " Goldilocks Effect " for me .

The lectures and practicals are very easy to understand . The programming homework is a little bit hard for a python beginner to finish . I wish there are more hints or test examples .

Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization , it ' s a bit of a bait - and - switch .

The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step - by - step . The subtitles / transcripts are a disappointment : ( . Full of mistakes .

Nice course ! It is definitely a beginner ' s course , and my only complaint is that in order to be able to take the capstone course we will have to pay for and be certified for this course . I really think there should be an option for people who aren ' t absolute beginners to enter the track at a later point and still be able to get the full cert and / or do the capstone . After all , this track is geared toward using Python for analysis and data science , which is hardly a topic that is for absolute beginners .

The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented . I feel like I learned a lot . However , the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level , and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures .

There is absolutely no supervision on this course .

A great course to begin Machine Learning ! Prof . Ng explains everything very well and gives good examples on each subject . The course also involves applications in Octave / Matlab . This course is highly recommented !####[([5, 6], [1], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [16, 17, 18], 'POS'), ([5, 6], [36, 37], 'POS')]
I thoroughly enjoyed the course . I was disappointed that there was not more participation in the forums from other classmates . I found Dr . Oakley ' s methods of teaching very creative and assisting in the learning process . The testing did indeed help my learning as it showed where I was wrong and gave me the opportunity to correct it . The outside reading was also helpful in understanding the material .####[([4], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([17], [8], 'NEG'), ([24, 25, 26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31, 32, 33], 'POS'), ([24, 25, 26, 27, 28], [35, 36, 37, 38, 39], 'POS'), ([73], [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71], 'POS'), ([42], [44, 45, 46, 47], 'POS')]
This is an excellent introduction to Chinese language and grammar . I think it could have some introduction to written Chinese because Pinyin is not so common . I struggled with some of the quizzes where written answers were given , even when my answers were correct some quizzes required stops ( . ) others didn ' t . Apart from that it was excellent .####[([6, 7, 8, 9], [3, 4], 'POS'), ([34], [29], 'NEG'), ([6, 7, 8, 9], [64], 'POS')]
Awesome course ! Thanks for everything ! It would however be great if you also could provide the Chinese characters for all the stuff we ' ve learned * while * we learn it and not in the end of the course . Best , Vinicius####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([1], [3], 'POS')]
I enjoyed the course , but I the scripting part was still mainly , " here ' s a script to add to the game , and then we ' ll look it over " . There was very little scripting until the project , which really didn ' t require much scripting either . I recommend adding more ACTUAL scripting , or a new section or course that discusses ACTUAL scripting . Otherwise , I did find it informative . I have a lot more questions , but until I see the final course , I can ' t say whether they ' ll be addressed .####[([3], [1], 'POS'), ([3], [77, 78, 79], 'POS')]
PROF , David Rossiter is a real professional . Knows what he are saying about and provide all needed information to learners shortly and straightforward ! It is big please to see videos with him .

Great course ! I am new in the field of qualitative research and I am enjoying every lecture here . Gerben is an interesting lecturer . I wish I could attend some of his class in person .

I landed up reading the book that this course was based on and I feel it did an excellent job condensing the concepts from the book into an easy to absorb fashion . I plan to use many of the recommendations this course made and already found the lesson on the diffuse mode helping my more creative endeavors ( made my Best Man speech much better when I just let my mind wander first ! ) . However , while I found the HW assignments made this course easy to complete which is likely the goal , I ' m wondering if the course could be more creative in providing assignments that really help the students practice to absorb the concepts for this book for the long term .####[([8], [18, 19], 'POS'), ([8], [28, 29, 30, 31], 'POS'), ([83, 84], [88, 89, 90], 'POS'), ([110], [104, 105, 106, 107], 'NEG')]
I have a Masters degree and until I took this MOOC I had somehow gotten used to the ridiculous notion that I had learned everything that I needed to know . I am pleasantly amazed at how much I still don ' t know and I am very excited to learn more . I have even started reading journal articles by Page and Zellner because I am very facinated by the models shown to me in this course . Thank you very much for making this material available .####[([77], [67, 68], 'POS')]

Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? ! In addition , you can ' t participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself . I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum####[([0], [2], 'POS'), ([62], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([9], [12], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 'NEG'), ([15, 16], [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], 'NEG'), ([25], [81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87], 'NEG')]
I didn ' t like this course as much . Mostly because the peer reviews were strict and unforgiving and as an experienced , essay writer , I didn ' t feel I needed the rigid , boring academic structure required for this assignment .

Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[([1], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [3], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], 'POS'), ([8, 9, 10], [22, 23, 24, 25, 26], 'POS'), ([51], [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], 'POS'), ([51], [40, 41], 'POS'), ([51], [72, 73], 'POS')]
Highly useful lectures . The classes can be more effective by active participation of more students simultaneously . A brief insight into derivation of some basic concepts and introduction to fundamental difference between different kinds of members used in engineering applications can be added .

Outdated materials , theory is taught and then praxis is tested . Course needs an update to materials and either teach AND test theory , or teach AND test praxis . I passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization I needed to pass the tests . Additionally , the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring .####[([1], [0], 'NEG'), ([12], [13, 14, 15], 'NEG'), ([65], [71, 72], 'NEG'), ([12], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 'NEG')]

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before . I worked hard to be able to follow it , but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were , I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it .

Amazing Course Module , I learned a lot of concepts for classifications using Decision Trees , Logistic Functions , Boosting , Ensemble and way to attack problems .

I think everyone should follow this course . If I ' d had these insights when I was in high school , or even the beginning of college , I would have done so much better .

This is a really fascinating course , ' cuz it is organized in a way that students could truly get a lot out of it , though indeed great effort input is required compared to other courses .

The course started really well and followed on nicely from the first course in the series but I ' m really disappointed and frustrated with the video editing issues . Many were fixed but there are still some errors / omissions and the second half of the course was very short of content compared to the rest .
