Great introduction to Java . Gives you an opportunity to play with several different libraries from the start , rather than learning the basics with just text input and output like most courses , which is really cool .

I have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area , as well as great machine learning enthusiasts . However , I did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and ( very ! ) expensive platform , mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning .

The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality . The assignment questions were often nebulous . This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader .

I think this was a very good course . Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours / week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics .

An extremely well - structured and useful course . As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python , this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language . Moreover , the technical knowledge included ( APIs , RegEx , etc ) is highly relevant and practical .

I appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips .

Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples . One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks : Week 4 and Week 5 . The teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks .

Great course ! I highly recommend it both for teachers and teacher trainers . All content is delivered in a very engaging manner . Although I have already had a solid previous experience in the area , I have gained a lot from this course . It is definitely worth taking if you are interested in effective professional development . the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms . For example , the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market . Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year . for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15 % , then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year .####[['course', 'Great'], ['course', 'highly recommend it'], ['content', 'delivered in a very engaging manner'], ['course', 'gained a lot'], ['course', 'definitely worth taking'], ['course', 'practical examples in simple terms']]
The lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking . You need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand . Just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project , in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project .

Extremely well done videos , Professor Sachs is articulate and clear . The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment . The quiz are not easy , one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5 .

Very interesting course . Truly enjoyed studying the behaviour of the animals I started appreciating a lot . Nevertheless 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the course is typically focusing on the large scale agro industrial side more then the ( increasing number ) of small scale / hobby keepers .

Lectures and quizzes are okay , assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics . I have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs . However , I do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasks . Programming assignments aren ' t really friendly to Haskell ' s list , and vectors are not available .

Machine Learning is an excellent course with great presentations . This is not an easy course , and I found myself reviewing concepts and being challenged to dive deeper into the material .

This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security , but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities . I however was slightly disappointed with the testing methods of this course . I feel that most of the testing should have been on the basis of projects and a project should have been included every week . But , all in all taking the course was a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects that were given .

I have just finished the course . The course professor has used real life cases to link up with the course material which helps students to connect well with the concepts being used .

I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn ' t always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted . For a non - specialist , statistics is almost always a struggle , intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at math . I worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all 6 weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam I said to myself enough is enough . I hate being a quitter , but I was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and self - doubt because I just couldn ' t match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the course .

I have taken several classes here and I have to say this is one of the best .

The course has enhanced my reading experience . Writing in the margins… up till now I have never challenged or asked the writer any questions .

There is quality implicit in the approach taken , but in my opinion , this course is excessively short , having only 20 - 25 minutes of videos per week , what is very limiting .

Just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning .####[['course', 'excessively short'], ['material', 'not adequate']]

Great course ! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve . The case studies were relevant and interesting , and the guest speakers were good as well .

Decent coverage of the basics , but some of the data , tools and approaches used are out of date by 2 - 3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast - moving social space . For example , they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM . For someone completely new to the social space , this could be a great starter class . Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you ' re current . After grading assignments by other students , it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat : most either didn ' t invest in the assignments or didn ' t understand the materials .

This is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic , but doesn ' t go into much depth . While it ' s clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material , I still would not recommend this course . Both the presentation itself and the in - video quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious . The presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to , and the in - video quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time . Sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities , which are badly designed and just frustrating .

It is a great course for me . At the end of the course , I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation . As opposed to the stated prerequisite , I believe the course requires engineering / math / physics background . On the down side , there is no TA presence in the discussion forum .

The content of the slides were sufficient for the basic intent of this offering . The overview and reasoning behind why the products are competitive for other contending services was clear . When performing the labs , the content is very recipe driven . While that works well for someone attempting to get the work done , there needs to be some visuals prepared that show how the GCP components are laid out and the relationship they have to each other ( simple architecture views ) . The GCP products have very similar sounding names , so paragraphs describing what is happening have less effect , whereas some simple architecture views of what the lab is intending to do to go with that in the lab content itself , might help .####[['content of the slides', 'sufficient']]
Tons of value - - for free ! ! I hope in future iterations of this course you could include more tangible tools we can use to help grow our business . These lectures included a few resources - - but more could definitely be introduced . As a business owner myself , this course has shed some light on things I hadn ' t considered - - and offered a more academic approach to business .

Outstanding course . My only feedback is you force the students to use Octave / MATLAB . I used Python do all the assignments but I didn ' t bother submitting my answers to get credit for the course because I would have had to reimplement it again in Octave .

I audited this course . The videos are in fact useful . However , it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course .

If you have some background programming in another language , and some familiarity with HTML / CSS , this course does a fantastic job introducing both Ruby and Rails . The first week walks you through machine and environment setup , the second walks through the basics of the Ruby programming language , and the third walks through using the Rails framework to develop simple websites in Ruby . All the lessons are laid out clearly with solid examples . That said , this is not a beginner course . It really only spends a week covering how to program in Ruby , and Ruby has some quirks that make it a challenging first language . If you ' re brand new to programming , do yourself a favor and take an introductory course first .####[['course', 'does a fantastic job'], ['lessons', 'laid out clearly'], ['lessons', 'solid examples']]

Although the course material is very good but what I believe is that Image processing is a course where only theory isn ' t sufficient . Programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just MCQ quizzes . This is the reason why Andrew Ng ' s Machine learning on coursera appears very engaging . Whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderful .

This course has been very interesting , however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited . While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists , I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance : picking up litter , photographing it , and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography , unless the artist ' s message is in documenting our ' throw - away ' society and highlighting the importance of ' recycling ' for the benefit of the environment . Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion . The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused . The interviewer ( s ) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist ( s ) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests . My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent .####[['course', 'very interesting'], ['course', 'NULL']]

I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift . The lessons felt very unstructured , unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn ' t know they were being recorded , this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an " introduction to . . . course . A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming . To summarise , the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content .####[['lessons', 'very unstructured'], ['lessons', 'unplanned and ad hoc']]

Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course . Booksite , video materials and assignments are amazing . Would recommend this course to everyone ! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree . Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted . not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks . hard for a student ( even one who has a programming background ) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront . The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course . the whole course seems disjointed . would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving .####[['Lecturer', 'Exceptionally good'], ['course', 'Exceptionally good'], ['Booksite', 'amazing'], ['video materials', 'amazing'], ['assignments', 'amazing'], ['course', 'recommend'], ['course', 'seems disjointed']]

This course was carefully programmed and developped by a team directed by Chris Mortensen . It is obvious that he loves horses and the research he does , specially that concerning equine reproduction . I love horses myself and I learned a lot of characteristics about horses and other equid animals . It is a very complete course as introduction to the field . If more developped courses are programmed , I will be happy to follow them . Thanks a lot to the whole team and Coursera for programming this kind of courses .####[['course', 'carefully programmed']]

I just completed the course . This course is recommended to beginners like me because I learned a new perspective to cyber security .

The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .####[['lectures', 'do exactly what you need']]

I ' ll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing . There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways . The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking . The reason that I ' ve only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework . I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation .

Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX , it is still very underwhelming . Priced at £39 , the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks . It is hard to justify that for example " week " 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz . . . Week " 4 is 15mins .

The instructor might be a good web developer , but neither she nor anyone else on her team know how to write a parser . Unfortunately , that is exactly what they attempted to do for grading Final Projects . Unless you are ready to suffer through several hours of tearing your hair out because their parser does not accept perfectly written code , don ' t take this course . The only thing you ' ll learn through the experience is that some people should stay as far away from writing autograders as the planet would allow them .

Really interesting course and material and a very good instructor . This would be a 5 stars course if it wasn ' t for the final project .

A very refreshing course that focuses on the character growth of students . Inspires teachers how to teach and practice character that can influence students to practice the same wherever they are .

To be completely honest , I was expecting more from this course . One big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on , and instead jumps straight into algorithms . This might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code . I , on the other side , have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms , but when Pavel mentions gene expression and transcription I have a very vague idea what he is talking about .####[['course', 'expecting more'], ['material', 'NULL']]
Thanks Professor Hare and Coursera since I do enjoy this amazing course which challenges many stereotypes . For example , dogs evolved from wolves not because of human ' s intentional domestication but due to " self - domestication " 12 - 15000 ago . Also , it is generally regarded that certain breeds of dogs are smarted than other . However , in this course , Professor Hare points out that cognition involves many types of intelligence rather than one and there is even tremendous variation within a dog breed in temperament , behavior and especially cognition . Strongly recommend this course especially when you ca n taste this class with your own dog !####[['Professor Hare', 'Thanks'], ['Coursera', 'Thanks'], ['course', 'amazing'], ['course', 'Strongly recommend']]
The professors need to go into more detail with JavaScript . Our assignment required the use of JavaScript but it didn ' t fully explain how to use the code that was shared during our class .

The most valuable insight was at the end . We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product . I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations . Overall the course gave a good overview , though it was a mixture of the very simple ( calculations ) and difficult ( the explanation of the polymers ) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading . Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output . I hope the project gets funding to continue the research .####[['course', 'NULL']]

Overall this is a really great course . My small criticism : Sometimes I wished for more optional videos containing proofs of the formulas . I often spent all the time watching the videos wondering how we would solve some problem only to be presented with a formula without any explanation where it came from . This is only a small problem because the answer was usually not too hard to find and often even linked in the discussion , but if this information were contained in the course content ( e . g . optional videos assuming some linear algebra background ) , it would be even better .####[['course', 'really great'], ['videos', 'wished for more']]

I really liked this course . Although some of it depended too much on pre - made scripts it was at the level of games that make sense to a beginner without being to complex ( like all of Unity ' s own tutorials are ) . Sometimes , it went to fast and I was quickly switching from Unity to Coursera to hit the " pause " button to give me time to catch up .

I did this course last year , and consider it to be among the very best I have seen . It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers , everyone of whom know that material very well ; they are great presenters also . If I had been asked , before I took the course , about summarizing 4 billion years in 10 weeks ( 400 million years per week ) , I ' d have said it was impossible . These guys actually did it , and they did it well !

Lecture quality is not as good as other sessions of the course . Plus the grading system is not upto the mark .

If you do not know R studio or R programming this course will be very difficult for you . The fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable . Week 2 test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions . Their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answer . I ' m very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because I do not have the time to figure out how to program in R .####[['course', 'very difficult for you'], ['course', 'very disappointed']]

Quick overview of the Arduino platform . Since I was new to Arduino , it helped me gather key concepts quickly and effectively . The peer - reviewed grading process is something that can be improved .

This is a course that would be helpful to complete programming novices . Any prior knowledge of programming is likely to render it useless to the student . That being said , a programming newbie should have no problem following it . The professor speaks slower than necessary . 1 . 75x or 2x speeds make the pace more manageable and is still easy to follow . In addition , it uses an old version of Python , which tends to make the exercises slightly annoying .####[['course', 'no problem following it'], ['professor', 'speaks slower than necessary'], ['exercises', 'slightly annoying'], ['course', 'NULL']]

This course gave a great opportunity to explore one ' s creativity , with assignments that didn ' t require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression . However , I also found that it didn ' t give me the richness of principles and techniques that I ' ve found in other courses in this sequence . I expect that , for an in - person course , this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content . In a peer review situation , the feedback is quite general and so doesn ' t take up the slack from the lectures .

This continues Dr . Chuck ' s easing into Python . It ' s a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource . The existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isn ' t really stressed , which is unfortunate as it ' s helpful . About the only thing I ' d appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity .####[['course', 'great'], ['book', 'NULL'], ['exercises', 'NULL'], ['Dr .

This course is really well put together . The lectures are easy to follow and explain all points very clearly . I appreciate the supplementary quizzes to help me cement the knowledge from the lectures . The course provides tons of extra resources , so that you can entrench yourself in the learning as much as you like - - or you can just follow the lectures to learn the essential . My only recommendation would be to add more in - video questions .####[['course', 'really well put together'], ['lectures', 'easy to follow'], ['lectures', 'explain all points very clearly'], ['supplementary quizzes', 'appreciate'], ['resources', 'tons of extra'], ['in - video questions', 'add more']]
This course has been highly delightful to learn through the concepts of machine learning . For someone like me having 17years programming experience , and with some hands on of neural networks from colelge days , and analytic tools for a few applications in R ; it is a great refresher on the fundamentals and great breadth of practical technology elements that are most useful in machine learning applications . Andrew ' s teaching method is great . His clear and simplistic delivery style of complex concepts with apt examples ensures the student grasps the essence with ease and works navigates his way through complex algorithms with confidence . I would love sitting through his lectures in the future too ! Congratulations to the entire team that put together this course and making this a great service that is available for anyone wanting to learn ML !####[['course', 'highly delightful to learn'], ['Andrew', 'teaching method is great'], ['Andrew', 'clear and simplistic delivery style'], ['NULL', 'Congratulations']]

Great Teacher . Great examples . Only issue i did not like what that you had to find a partner to negotiate with and I found it a bit difficult to find people in my time zone who spoke good English .

There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters . It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming . Yes , a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot , but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality ! Also , I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there ( documentation , etc . ) could help them . Also , as the students start have to read multiple docs , etc . the time expectations per week should be increased .####[['NULL', 'little bit confusing and overwhelming']]

This is a very good introduction to machine learning . It covers a very broad set of material , and the lectures are very clear . The quizzes and programming assignments are based directly on the course material , making it easy to complete the assignments if you understand the lecture material ( in contrast with some other courses I have taken where the assignments require lots of extra material not taught in the course ) . It is very helpful to have some programming experience , and some knowledge of linear algebra , probability , and calculus . The course is very topical , so it does not go very deep into the material , but it does offer some practical advice for using machine learning algorithms in daily applications .####[['course', 'very good introduction'], ['lectures', 'very clear'], ['quizzes and programming assignments', 'NULL'], ['assignments', 'easy to complete']]

The module is overall great and gave me an intro on how game documents are developed , plus it made me start thinking like a game designer ( I hope ! ) My only complaint is that the homework is fairly restrictive only one - page game per week , which means there ' s only so much you can do ) but I do appreciate the fact that it simplifies things and if anything it pushes you to be even more creative , beyond the typical " board game " .####[['homework', 'fairly restrictive'], ['module', 'NULL']]

This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking . In addition , it allows you to access Craig Wortmann ' s " Sales Toolkit " , which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal / professional situations .

The Professor is excellent and very student - friendly , and the course material is very clear . Two issues though : 1 ) List comprehensions should be introduced . They are extremely powerful and should really be introduced at this stage . 2 ) Charging $ 79 for this course seems like poor value for money , specially for a student like me . It doesn ' t go into great detail and the price point for what is a 5 - 6 hour course with simple exercises seems too high .####[['Professor', 'excellent'], ['Professor', 'very student - friendly'], ['course material', 'very clear'], ['course', 'poor value for money'], ['exercises', 'simple'], ['course', "doesn ' t go into great detail"]]
Once again , Prof Chaikin has hit the ball out of the park in terms of design ( very hands - on ! ) of lessons and delivery of content . The painstaking attention to detail , intuition about particular pitfalls for new learners ( and more proficient ones too , in fact ) and of course , the self - deprecating humor all contribute to making this actually pretty advanced course a whole lotta fun ! And yes , like any really good teacher , Yakov feels the need to delve into theoretic niceties that most wouldn ' t . My background is that of an enthusiast programmer .

Sorry to say that , but this course has nothing related to programming . I like Dr .

The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R . This being said , I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth ( with further practice ) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery . I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy , and only now ( after completing the course here on Coursera , reading the textbook ( s ) , and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp ) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R .

This course is basic yet so powerful and will excite those who enroll that they would like to study the subject and that I feel is the most important objective of any course . I had already completed two game theory courses offered by Stanford university and still I found this course to be enriching .

Excellent course ! In the first weeks , when the course started out with linear regression , I was very skeptical whether I would learn anything non - trivial here . But then I was very impressed how professor Ng managed to introduce Neural Networks until week 5 in a very clear manner .

This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package , but suffers from some problems . The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments . The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky . As a result , every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants , instead of actually learning pandas . I managed to pass this course with ( what I know is ) subpar code , but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments .

Good overview and introduction to the more detail content of the following courses . If you are not familiar with Python , this will ease you into the language and enable you to follow . There is a certain style of teaching that you need to get accustomed too in the beginning but when it is done , lessons become very clear and easy to follow .

The first three weeks are totally trivial . I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called . Maybe good for school students . ) Week 4 is better .

Introduction is much more than this course is , in my respectful opinion . When I read the information on the specialized program , I thought it was something more compact , more useful in the face of the video game industry .

Only one assignment at the end , so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code ( this seems like a big mistake for any programming course ) . The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes . You can ' t put that as a project on a resume , because you ' re doing 5 % of the work with your hand held through it . Worst of all , the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices , like local variables not being declared ( so that they become global variables , a big no - no ) , spacing being all over the place , etc .

So much disjointed information . . . I felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this . Am waiting for another 8 hours before I can reattempt the quiz .

While this is a great course for introductory programming , I believe that it suffers from its focus on cokeskultpor UI design . The main issue I have with it is that these skills are not easily transferred to real world applications . I think some time spent on a basic introduction to tkinter would be good to help get people started on how to make their own programs . I found that the grading rubrick in particular focused too much on simple UI elements and not enough on making sure that the code was good or that the game even worked . For example , I had one person who had everything in pong perfect except that the score was added when the ball hit the paddle . This meant that the game as whole did not work as expected , but it only cost him 2 marks .####[['course', 'great'], ['course', 'not easily transferred to real world'], ['grading rubrick', 'NULL']]

Basically if you take this course you are paying money to create an account on a website and download some software ( both of which you can do for free ) . The rest of it is a preview of the other courses in the series . The quiz questions don ' t correspond to the information on the slides .

I was a student of Art History and I graduated with a theme focusing on Documentary Photography and Photojournalism , therefore I have read many books about photography and I thought I knew a lot about it . But this course showed me new perspectives and ideas , presented new photographers I have not yet know , and gave me new motivation to work in the field of photography . I also appreciated so much that there were scans of books and articles for us to read in combination with images and video I think the mix of all three is a perfect way to study and should be also practised at Faculties ( and from my experience , it is not always like that ) . Great work , I was really lucky and honoured to be part of the course .####[['course', 'Great work']]

The whole curse relies on the automated grading system , which is still a little sloppy . I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions .

Amazing Course , teaches you right from basics . Prof . Ng explains everything in a manner which makes it easy to understand . Only one shortcoming I found in this course is , not challenging enough programming exercises .

As someone who develops online courses for a living , I suggest using two cameras so that you can switch between two views when a cut is needed to prevent jumping or leaving mistakes in videos .

The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions .

The course is definitely high - quality and the topics are covered in a good way . I ' m not giving 5 stars because I would have expected SVMs and neural networks . Mentioning the many different algorithms for learning decision trees would have been nice , without necessarily focusing on each of them in depth . An entire week spent on precision / recall seems a little bit too much , without touching other metrics like F - score .

I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway . This course will leave you equipped and confident to get into the amazing world of Machine Learning . Professor Ng and his team has truly created a gem . I wish they would create and release the Deep Learning course , which delves into further models and topics currently very hot in the world of ML .####[['course', "DON ' T recommend"], ['course', "doesn ' t spend much effort to structure"], ['videos', 'short'], ['assignments', 'just open discussion among students'], ['course', "haven ' t learn anything"], ['NULL', 'evaluate with each other'], ['course', 'just a waste of time and money']]
Thanks for providing us this opportunity . It was a very nice course . There are few things which might help improve the course : - For a four - weeks course , I feel the material was not enough .

Great class ! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging . My only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand .

I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general . My only criticism is that the course still uses an older version of Python which has some differences and can make the learning frustrating if you are not aware of those differences . Granted , with a free textbook for an older version this is a minor issue thus far in the series .####[['textbook', 'explaining things very well'], ['course', 'good foundation'], ['course', 'still uses an older version'], ['course', 'make the learning frustrating']]

A fantastic fundamental insight into the workings of the different aspects of financial markets ! In contrast to most finance classes , there ' s plenty of history to explain how the current financial markets came to be after previous infrastructure was battered many times by financial crises . In addition , the guest lectures by extremely prominent people in the field ( not to mention that the professor himself is a Nobel Laureate ) really gives this course a rather practical aspect as lecturers explain real difficulties outside of the classroom . The actual ( & more mathematical ) version of this class can also be found on YouTube !####[['professor', 'NULL']]

Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning . However , as the models get more complicated , some of the material isn ' t really explained very well , specially the last module about ' deep learning ' is quite superfluous .

Great subject and some very well presented videos . However there were several which were incomprehensible .

Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course .

This is a lousy course .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work .

I ' ve already written a review for part 1 and I have the same opinion about this one . The course is rather poor and not challenging .

This is an excellent course for two reasons : first the video lectures are very good , introducing complex concepts in a relatively accessible manner , and second the automated submission system is good at marking your ( well designed ) assignments . What could be better : compared to a traditional ( physical ) course , I miss the notes . It would be very useful if there was some form of notes , either as an informal textbook or cheat - sheets for each lecture . Another improvement would be that in some cases , it ' s possible to ' solve ' the assignments without necessarily understanding them . This is because you are sometimes given ' too many ' hints or the transformation of the existing code to the final form is rather trivial . Overall an excellent course though .####[['course', 'excellent'], ['video lectures', 'very good'], ['video lectures', 'NULL'], ['NULL', 'good at marking'], ['notes', 'NULL'], ['assignments', 'NULL'], ['course', 'excellent course though']]
This class was really difficult . The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes ( particularly in Week 3 & 4 ) and the final exam was immensely difficult . Additionally , the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i . e . repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs . I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn ' t have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class .####[['class', 'really difficult'], ['material', 'did not cover what we needed'], ['final exam', 'immensely difficult'], ['class', 'NULL']]

The lecture quality should be dramatically improved . Even at 2x speed , I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos . In the conclusion , Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is " new " , but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist , and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old , even more than a decade in some cases . so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist . I ' ve taken more than 5 coursera classes , and this has been my least satisfying .  . .

This course is great . The teachers provide excellent exposition of the problems , the formalization , and the solution concepts of generic agents and types of agents acting simultaneously , sequentially in games with complete and incomplete information . The math required is middle school probability calculation and equations .

Professor Fowler is great ! He spends some time explaining the theory behind the topic , and makes everything pretty easy to visualize .

The videos and explanations are very poor . Most of the time the instructors are reading off a script , and everything feels fake .

The lectures were not very interesting or instructive . The reading materials were much more so . However , the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on self - reflection than on the materials . I learned a little bit , and as such found the course worth the time I put into it , but I almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials , and thus derive very little benefit from it . I would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revamping .  In addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials , I think more real - life examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition . )####[['lectures', 'not very interesting or instructive'], ['reading materials', 'NULL'], ['assignments', 'NULL']]
The lectures do exactly what you need . He starts with just enough theory to help you understand a concept and then jumps into applying equations and solving example problems . The biggest problem is that there are examples that are wrong every once in a while during the lectures and one or two in each quiz . It ' s not a huge deal because sometimes figuring out where he went wrong helps you to understand the problem better . It can be annoying for some examples though .####[['lectures', 'NULL'], ['NULL', 'NULL']]

The assignments where challenging enough in weeks 1 , 2 , and 3 .

There is a lot of self - teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions . In addition , the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding .

There is some good content on creativity in this course , thoug it barely addresses problem solving .  Do something different " assingments were an interesting idea . Some content material is missing , including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quizz which will influence your final grade .

Very helpful for absolutely beginners . The content is well - organized and materials are carefully picked to provide concise , easy - to - read information for learners . Lectures are clear , well - presented , just - right informative ; accompanied by the great public speaking skill of the instructor , they are hence not intimidating or boring at all . Another plus point is the instructor constantly urging learners to go beyond " the passing point " and learn more on their own , which is a very key mindset to keep up with the fast , ever - changing landscape of Information Technologies . Don ' t feel lost or scared , since she ' ll provide you with great resources for further learning and references !####[['NULL', 'Very helpful'], ['content', 'well - organized'], ['materials', 'carefully picked'], ['materials', 'concise'], ['materials', 'easy - to - read information'], ['Lectures', 'clear'], ['Lectures', 'well - presented'], ['Lectures', 'just - right informative'], ['instructor', 'great public speaking skill'], ['instructor', 'constantly urging learners'], ['instructor', 'provide you with great resources'], ['Lectures', 'not intimidating or boring']]
I did not know anything about Ruby or Rails before this course . I found this course quite challenging because there was so many new concepts covered in very rapid fashion : Ruby , Rails , Rspec , all other tools . However , I think the coverage of the unit testing concepts was really useful . I had to go for google quite many times to find out resolve issues I had with the tools and assignments . But in the end , I think this course was a good one , rating it 4 out of 5 starts .####[['course', 'quite challenging'], ['course', 'really useful'], ['assignments', 'NULL'], ['course', 'good'], ['course', '4 out of 5 starts'], ['course', 'new concepts covered in very rapid fashion']]
This is an exceptional course . The quality of the lectures – course content , lecturing approach , and audiovisual production – is top - notch . Randy Picker provides a fascinating , engaging look at various devices and platforms , starting with their history and then integrating legal considerations , particularly under antitrust and copyright law . He presents the material in an easily comprehensible and digestible way , and explores subjects ( and objects ) that are very relevant in the modern , connected , digitized , and ( borrowing a word from this class ) mediated world . I learned a lot , enjoyed the lectures , and can see the application of what I learned outside the virtual classroom .

I thought the course was a fantastic introduction to environmental law and policy . I especially enjoyed the structure of each lesson ( reading - > video ) and the entire course . I thought the Prof did a great job of being enthusiastic and was mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing each case . Perhaps , an aspect that could be improved in the future is to ask more in - video question to challenge the student to think critically while watching the videos . However , where there is most room for improvement is to have much better management of the discussion section . There was no authority answering any questions whatsoever , not content related nor operational .####[['course', 'fantastic introduction'], ['Prof', 'great job'], ['Prof', 'enthusiastic'], ['in - video question', 'ask more'], ['course', 'better management of the discussion section'], ['course', 'no authority answering any questions'], ['course', 'especially enjoyed the structure'], ['video', 'especially enjoyed the structure'], ['Prof', 'mostly clear when explaining , analyzing and discussing']]
After being bored to death by his first highly complex and involved analytical / historical lectures , I skipped over every video that Prof . Germano lectured in .

This course doesn ' t have any writing assignments . I appreciated it because it truly did help me understand the ins and outs of citations , which I needed to know in order to continue on with this course .

I thoroughly enjoyed this course . It was a narrowly - defined topic ( Questionnaire Design ) that was well - explored ; this makes the course feel like you are actually learning something and does not feel overwhelming in the slightest .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise .

The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[['course', 'well thought'], ['course', 'masterfully set of lessons'], ['course', 'basic'], ['course', 'very easy to follow and finish'], ['Quizzes', 'alternating between very good and very bad'], ['peer grading', "doesn ' t make for a good use"], ['videos', 'made with an indecent knowledge of the technology'], ['videos', 'green screens were used so badly'], ['slides', 'cut away and put back'], ['slides', 'downright infuriating'], ['course', 'very good opening'], ['course', 'needs serious improvement']]
The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected . For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria . The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous . There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over .####[['course', 'valuable'], ['assignments', 'poorly integrated'], ['documents', 'either not covered or barely covered'], ['assignments', 'left off a section required'], ['quizes', 'poorly tied to the lecture material'], ['quizes', 'ambiguous'], ['quizes', 'single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over']]
Lectures and other material just don ' t cover the information needed in the course project . Majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course , in order to pass the course project .

A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course . Many were passed onto " look this up yourself " , which is fine , but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong . The group _ by stuff was especially tricky , as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example , eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) .

Amazing introduction to the basics of philosophy  I wish I had such in university or at some other early point . It shows you breadth , scope and problems philosophy deals with . Course tries to maintain simplicity and clarity of explanations even for very complex things and this is exactly what you need for a subject which is normally deemed too complex for beginners or gives an explanations which for uninitiated do not add clarity and rather raise even more questions .

Course had good structure , the videos were informative and really encouraging to go and start moving , from simple things like stretching at home or in your office to more sophisticated activites like sports or dance . Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way – it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) – every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity . I thought this course will be just fun , you know , everyone knows that sitting too much is bad etc . , but it really worked for me as a motivation to set some goals and get moving .

Some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them ( e . g . Gibbs sampling ) .

Could not get through the first week . Way too much emphasis on BlueJ and Duke University specific libraries .

This course provides a well - paced introduction to learning the Korean language . It is well - suited to students who have little or no knowledge of Korean language to begin with . The course videos and the conversations of the players in the instructive videos helps us to get a feel for how the language operates in a real situation . The course lecturer provides detailed explanations of the origins of Korean vowels and consonants , the way the language is constructed , correct pronunciation , and much more . I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the Korean language .

For a beginner , this course was a challenge in comparison to the other three base parts of Craft of Writing , but as a result of the challenge , it is by far the most rewarding as well . The concepts discussed , and the material provides the learners with both broad perspective into several topics that I would argue to be crucial in becoming a writer , and also a deep look at some very key concepts to writing . I would recommend taking this course last of the four , before beginning the Capstone project - if you ' re planning on going through all the parts . If you ' re a more seasoned writer , I would recommend starting with this course , and seeing how you fare with it . I ' ve enjoyed all of the base courses , but for me personally , this one struck the strongest chord .####[['course', 'challenge'], ['material', 'NULL'], ['course', 'recommend taking this course']]

The class is a pretty nice overview of metrics in general . it is more broad than it is deep , and sometimes the videos and explanations were not the most easily digested . While the content was helpful , this class could have been greatly improved if slides were provided instead of just a transcript .

The content of the course is extremely useful for young emerging scientists like myself ; however , the videos were very hard to follow because the team speaks fast and with a very strong French accent . The materials are well - prepared , but my attention kept drifting away from the content due to language impairment . Also , some of the introductory notes were lacking proper grammar and I believe that , in a course with such a theme , this is simply unacceptable .

Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course . Being a true beginner w / no background in programming or data science , I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises ( which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate ) and lectures . I spent 8 - 12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in . I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems .####[['Coursera', 'Love'], ['course', 'disappointed'], ['programming assignments', 'way too far a stretch'], ['programming assignments', 'NULL']]

I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class .

This is a great introductory course . The course materials are carefully organized , to avoid lengthy mathematical content , yet conveying the key idea of machine learning . The selection of the topic also seems quite reasonable . This course builds a somewhat solid ground for beginners .

I ' m not exactly new to python , but my typical use - cases looked more like hacking rather then conscious programming .

From the basic layout of the course you would assume it ' s for beginners since it covers step - by - step instructions to install software and run command on command line window . But on the other hand , many advanced concepts are slipped in this course without even basic introduction . I remember in one class , " data dredging " is discussed for about 2 - 3 minutes . But the instructor did not give a brief description about what it is , instead it just goes on about when you do not have clear question in your mind , you would run the risk of data dredging .

This is a very comprehensive course ( based on my personal experience with Coursera at least ) that goes into relevant detail on the topics it covers , but without wasting time on unnecessary trivialities . The delivery is clear and engaging , so if you ' re interested in the matter , you won ' t get bored . The material covers all the right topics for an up and coming web designer , providing the right amount of information for a confident start and plenty of pointers where and how to expand on the knowledge provided . Another point in favor is the frequent and valuable engagement of the professor and his teaching assistants in the discussion forums , unlike some other courses that feel abandoned by the staff once they start .

Thank you very much for this course . I really enjoyed the level of the course . In particular the fact that a decent amount of research was needed to work on the assignment .

The course is more an exercise in flexing Ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching . The learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants . You ' re interested in this course either to ( a ) learn something about an exciting and ever changing field and / or ( b ) to have the Stanford logo on your LinkedIn profile . In both cases , move on . The curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap .####[['course', 'NULL'], ['course', 'learning curve is too steep']]
The lecture / interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table . The topic of the MOOC is actually quite simple , and it ' s its simplicity that makes it so important - first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means , ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers . The fact that it isn ' t so nowadays , is the reason for so many failures and it ' s also why this course is so relevant .####[['MOOC', 'simplicity'], ['MOOC', 'relevant']]
I would not recommend this one to any paying customer . This is the second intro to Graphic Design class I have take on Coursera , and I found the way the material was presented in the CalArts course to be quite slow and pretty boring . Our assignments were simple and I felt no excitement in doing them . It would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building blocks could be used in real life design . The other class ( by CU - Boulder ) made me want to continue learning , and I felt excited to complete the projects whereas with this class I was forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required ones .####[['NULL', 'not recommend'], ['material', 'slow and pretty boring'], ['assignments', 'simple and I felt no excitement in doing them']]
I wish I could rate this course higher but I didn ' t enjoy it and despite being 10 / 12 weeks into it , I ' m going to stop now .

I ' ve always loved video games , but knew nothing about game dev . I decided to take this Specialization because the dev courses focus on Unity , a good choice for indie development .

Excellent course for understanding studies and policies about terrorism , its origins and the ways for understanding it . Terrorism is not about killing people ; it ' s about fearing people too .

The course is excellent . The platform has some aspects not so good - some parts still don ' t show up as ' done ' , so the progress line is always wrong . Also , the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series , leaving the dates etc wrong .

Learning How To Learn is a great course for those who aren ' t sure about their learning tactics like I was before I joined .

Great course , it is refreshing to revisit topic in psychology with a different perspective . I like that Professor Seamon demonstrates various phenomena associated with Hollywood films .

This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace . It ' s not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered - it couldn ' t possibly do so in the time - - but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later .

You can ' t introduce yourself to someone if you don ' t know who you are .

Good lessons but the issue for me was that some of the video content was a little outdated . For example , it doesn ' t cover the update version of github website and how to use it . That being said directions sometime can be a little bit confusing . Another thing is some of the instructions are not clear for instance the guidance to how to submit an assignment . It is also intimidating that questions cannot be answered directly and if you want answers you have to dig a little bit dipper to get exactly what you are looking for .####[['video content', 'little outdated'], ['video content', 'instructions are not clear']]

I thought all of the information was great but at times the course was just very bland especially in terms of presentation . Also , the title is somewhat misleading and the presumptions that the course creators make about its students assume I am a business guy sitting in an office or a part of some team which makes the activities that you HAVE to do in order to pass the course a bit harder to complete . This is good because if what the activity desn ' t really apply to your situation it makes good practice to imagine a situation - not soo imaginative the task is incredibly easy - and apply what you ' ve learned . However , as I ' ve said , if what you ' re being asked to do is harder to apply than the activity in many ways isn ' t all that practical . I prefer Cumulative tests as well because they assess everything you ' ve learned and whether you ' ve retained the information or not .####[['course', 'very bland'], ['activity', 'NULL']]
I enjoyed this course immensely ! I was a bit hesitant due to its length , however , the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting . A couple of the weeks , the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry . Also , I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation . I feel as though I didn ' t really understand those concepts until watching that week ' s as well as the next week ' s lectures . Finally , the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn ' t match well to what the instructors actually said .####[['course', 'enjoyed'], ['course', 'usually manageable and mostly interesting'], ['lectures', 'quite lengthy'], ['course', "didn ' t really understand"], ['quiz questions', 'NULL']]
I really do not like the R language I think it is sloppy and inconsistent . This class did ok teaching the basics of R , but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code ( a key part of writing code ! ) best practices for modularization and factoring , and so on . In other words , it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works , but does not teach you how to write good code in R .####[['class', 'NULL']]
I worked really hard on this course , but was stymied by a couple of quizzes . If I could not answer one question correctly , it meant I could not answer two or three of the next questions , meaning that I could not pass quiz .

I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class , but I don ' t feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime . The class was challenging , but mostly for the wrong reasons .

The course material and the instructor ' s lectures are excellent . However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly - - marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often .

Despite I guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ML basics , it is definitely just an introductive class . In particular I was surprised by the low quality of the material . The following are my notes and suggestions : - - I found the lectures highly redundant , with many unnecessary repetitions - - using a vector notation ( like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters ) throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable - - too much hand writing on the slides while talking : a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable - - very very poor video editing ( many times it ' s clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut ! ! ) - the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology , which would be more correct and easier to understand .

I also learned about the workings of a city , how they can become more sustainable , and most of all , I now have a deep and passionate yearning to do action in my community , and to travel to progressive places such as Malmo or Copenhagen and see for myself and wonderful progressive European countries have created , and also other examples in Asia and Australia and across the globe . It was a exhilarating and exciting journey .####[['class', 'very global'], ['class', 'opened my eyes'], ['class', 'exhilarating and exciting journey']]

I was sitting behind a proxy server while taking the whole course , I had to get connected to other network without proxy to perform many assignment .

Wrote a crawler and quite often it gets locked up in some kind of error .####[['course', 'sitting behind a proxy server'], ['assignment', 'get connected to other network'], ['Dr . Chuck', 'NULL']]

It was a very interesting course , however it was biased toward Spanish history with the inclusions .

This is a really hard course for an intermediate player . But it is an outstanding course , and it is amazing , if you think about it , to have hours of free access to Gary Burton .

It can be nice to walk through this process with a lecturer . Ian Harris does it well and knows the content well enough . Most of this content however is given sufficiently in the pamphlet with the Arduino Uno Starter Kit .

Very good basic course for everyone interested in the European Union . Here you can learn about the past and the present state of affairs in the EU , as well as get to know some future challenges .

I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities , but this course is clearly biased . The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest . A university is meant to teach the whole story , and have a truthful account of facts . I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals , on the pretext of unbiased learning . This course clearly has an agenda . I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not .####[['courses', 'free'], ['courses', 'clearly biased'], ['final module', 'particularly dishonest'], ['courses', 'deeply disappointed'], ['content', 'fallacious'], ['courses', 'clearly has an agenda']]
I enjoyed this class , but the content feels amateurish . One major detracting factor is grading of the exams - a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions . The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100 % . I don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class . This class was at it ' s best during the recitals , where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos .####[['class', 'enjoyed'], ['content', 'amateurish'], ['grading', 'complete waste of time'], ['slides', 'multiple examples of contradictory'], ['quiz', 'multiple examples of contradictory'], ['quiz', 'beyond the scope of the lectures'], ['quiz', 'steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams'], ['quiz', "don ' t think the quizes reinforced the material"], ['class', 'best during the recitals'], ['videos', 'understand the great strategies']]
Excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the Machine Learning .

It is a wonderful course for serious learners wanting to learn about the human nervous system and how it works . I myself am a medical doctor ( I graduated over two years ago ) and I can attest that ( in my university at least ) I didn ' t have neuroscience lectures with this depth and detail . Due to my medical background I found it comfortable to go through the course without much effort or lots of extra studying . But I figure that if you do not have some such foundation it might be a bit more challenging to go smoothly with the course , and you might needs more extra studying and more time put into the course . But if you are interested about neuroscience and want to learn the essentials of how the human brain works ( as per our current knowledge ) then I recommend that you put in the effort and go with the course even if you don ' t have a strong background in the life sciences or in medicine .

Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion . The discussion forum does not work as intended . There is too much noise . They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated .

This course is a must for students and teachers alike . As a final year neuroscience PhD candidate I expected to know by now how to learn , yet I got a wealth of advice and new insights .

Overall very detailed and informative . A great way to get insight into English Common Law . I just felt that in the last week ( 6 ) , perhaps the transcripts in English had a few mistakes and seemed to be missing out a few words of the lecturer .

Very interesting , up - to - date and relevant concepts on marketing and communication tools and how they relate to the fundamental goal of achieving long - term brand loyalty . I like the practical examples used as they help to illustrate the concepts well . If a little more coverage could be provided on digital marketing , it would be great .

I can only infer that this course ' s target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities . Unfortunately I am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples , watching the videos at 2x speed . The course itself is incredibly shallow , even for a survey course , and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors ' own products - - Graphlab Create . You ' ll be much better off taking Andrew Ng ' s course , which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary library . The only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab .####[['course', 'incredibly shallow'], ['videos', 'NULL'], ['course', 'basically serves as an ad']]

The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python , I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically . Where it falls down though is the assignment auto - grader . It ' s immensely fussy ( as I understand it has to be ) , but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don ' t sufficiently explicitly define whats expected . This means you spend more than 50 % of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so . I would recommend this course , but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future .####[['content', 'pretty good'], ['assignments', 'pretty good'], ['course', 'learn a lot'], ['auto - grader', 'immensely fussy'], ['assignment instructions', 'very vague'], ['assignment instructions', "don ' t sufficiently explicitly define"], ['assignment', 'spend more than 50 % of your assignment time debugging'], ['course', 'recommend this']]

This will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason . The entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses . As a result this is a pretty bland and boring 4 weeks . The assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded .

The course is really good with a lot of intuition and technical details . The assignments and quizzes help clarify concepts and ideas .

I had a lot of fun during this course , but I think it is simply too short to present all the topics in sufficient detail .

Great course first of all . One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures . The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift , which are really useful , but they are not comprehensive enough . So for most of the students , I believe , will have to do a lot of self - studying to finish the final project . But still , the final project is challenging and interesting .

he course was challenging , and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures , and a bit more practice on using the basic functions , I learned a lot . I thought the video lectures were a little sparse . here were only 20 - 30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit . More examples in video lectures would have helped . I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture .

I have met part of my goals of taking this program . hank you Prof . Mathias Finger . I would recommend it to be more data oriented like those case studies with specific examples so that it naturally converges to creating case study for a city at the end of the course as final project rather than optional study . Also , suggest to reduce discussions centred to challenges ( the course has taken too much of time ) and more towards different new services adopted by different cities to capture benefits / impact to the city GDP .####[['Prof .

This was a very good intro course . Some additions that could be applied may include : describing different types of motions ( interrogatives , cross motions ) ; types of judgments ( proscriptions , summary judgments , enjoinment ) , types of memoranda , or even a FOIA request . Maybe a look into work product privilege , protected documentation , principles of discovery . And finally , a little intro into the art of using case law as an event or test , for example ; in " Miranda " , " Keller " , " Brown " , or the " McDonnell Douglas test " .

Great course series that forced me to take some steps ( design docs ) that I ' d normally skimp on , and in doing so , realizing their true value .

This course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in Unity , something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the Internet .

I ' ve rated it 4 out of 5 stars not based on the content , but because the response time , interaction , and feedback could be improved upon . The content is definitely 5 of 5 .

This has been an exceptional course . I have really enjoyed it as an introductory course to Korean , because it does a good job of teaching the basics without trenching too much in the details . I believe that in beginning stages a learner should not boggle themselves down too much with the details of a language . With time and exposure details are learned . Our instructor was easy to comprehend in her English pronunciation ; she was professional , and she seem to enjoy the topic .

In terms of Theory for General Software Architecture this Course is a good refresher for a person who is working with Software Architecture already . The Course could have more focused on IoT specific scenarios compared to Generic Software Architecture .

I would not recommend this course for a beginning programmer , as the concepts Oderski covers are fairly complex and the homework is not simple . However , if you are wanting to learn more about functional programming , love to understand the guts of how programming languages work and process data , and want to diver deeper into recursion , then I would definitely recommend this course . I found it very informative and helpful . I will probably take the course again .

Very disappointed with this final course . Little to no support . Discussion Forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your own .

I am mixed on this class . I like it Ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms .

Very generic advice although the interviews with children ' s writers were illuminating and helpful .

Good , solid advice about setting character , scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer ' s block . The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience .

A course without almost any prerequisite knowledge requirements . While this makes it an excellent introductory course in Machine Learning and at the same time still applicable there are a few drawbacks . Your actual understanding of ML will be pretty shallow . Programming examples do to a certain extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms in use , but it ' s somewhat hard translating to real world use due to fairly heavy amount of abstraction and " code - hiding " . Still , I would recommend this course as a starter course for ML as it will greatly enhance your understanding for ML in general and where to go next .####[['Machine Learning', 'excellent introductory'], ['Programming examples', 'extent facilitate understanding of the algorithms'], ['Programming examples', 'hard translating to real world use'], ['Machine Learning', 'recommend'], ['Machine Learning', 'greatly enhance your understanding']]

This is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on Coursera at the time of this review . I have taken all of the courses in the series from Copenhagen Business School , as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions . This specific course on Strategic Management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options . It does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation , but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy , and is of value to any business minded individual .

Huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed , even if you submit before deadline . Course content is not substantiated with research . Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned , which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessions . The person responsible for the course should take the following actions : 1 ) Aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions2 ) Clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed . I estimate that there are 50 - 100 still pending review , many were submitted almost one year ago .####[['peer reviews', 'Huge backlog'], ['peer reviews', 'very difficult to get your own'], ['content', 'not substantiated with research'], ['Course', 'Assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned']]

Good class , knowledgeable professor . I would have preferred if some of the longer sessions ( closer to 20 minutes ) were split into two sessions . I didn ' t like the conversational style of this course , though , because it felt impersonal . It would have felt more personal to me if it had just been Dr . Fredericks on camera .

As others have said , the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials . However , the capstone project was a waste of time . Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me . In addition , the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1 / 3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all . This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses . I expected a lot more from a Wharton - led course - very disappointing .####[['courses', 'good'], ['courses', 'learned a lot from the videos and materials'], ['capstone project', 'waste of time'], ['courses', 'almost no collaboration between the professors'], ['courses', 'very disappointing']]

For me , a really nice combination of1 . a theoretical overview of database and data processing concepts , MapReduce and the most important implementations of the various concepts ( SQL and NoSQL databases ) , 2 . practical application of these concepts in real - world programming exercises . I like the way Bill explains , and I like the exercises - however , to complete those , you need to be ready to learn the technology on your own , the lectures are NOT about learning the technology ( Python programming etc . ) to do the exercises . For me , that ' s fine , but for people who have little or no programming experience it might be frustrating . So , if you like the combined approach of this course , I can really recommend it !####[['Bill', 'like the way'], ['course', 'really nice combination'], ['course', 'really recommend']]

In some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in R Programming . That ' s very little value for money . The final course project again feels like it ' s done in a rush and without another review : The submitted dataset should be automatically checked . It ' s simply impossible to derive from it whether the student did everything right , but it could be easily done programmatically .

Was a little too basic . Would have preferred more flesh ( both implementational and mathematical ) on the bones . I also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly " this is for the experts in linear algebra " . Come on !

The " Soul Beliefs " course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias . If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down , they partially succeeded . Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak . A better title for the course would be " why there is no soul " . That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda .####[['Soul Beliefs', 'seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner']]

I tried other complex Unity3d courses online , and this one beats them all in the way it is built stage by stage .

The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data . The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code . The auto - grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect . The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data , the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer .

Unlike the very first course for beginners , there is a little bit more content here , so I put 2 stars . However , I still found the pace was too slow , with too much distraction ( " funny " videos , teacher drinking and making mistakes , hummm ! ! ! ) . It is OK to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid ! I strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses , not 5 ( with the capstone ) . I am planning to move forward with Python , and to keep reading the booklet which is good ( I like the introduction about the HTTP , XML , JSON and SQL databases ) but sorry Dr Chuck I will not complete this specialisation , it is overpriced for what it is ! !####[['content', 'little bit more'], ['content', 'put 2 stars'], ['content', 'pace was too slow'], ['videos', 'too much distraction'], ['course', 'delivers content in proportion to what has been paid'], ['content', 'keep reading the booklet which is good'], ['course', 'like the introduction'], ['NULL', 'overpriced']]
This is a great introduction to a more formal approach to algorithms and I look forward to the rest of the courses in the specialization .

The problems are interesting , the course is great . However , the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well - defined , which makes it really difficult to solve ( especially the dataset problem ) . The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple , but is not applicable to a large set of problems , only to the particular dataset that is given ( and the characteristics of this dataset is not given ; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset , which makes the problem more difficult ) . The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly . However , I really appreciate the whole courses , and I think it has been a great experience to go through the courses !

Professor Severance is awesome . I really like how each video is an in - depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when . I think his sense of what ' s important is spot on as I ' ve already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects , the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter . The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned . I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week ' s material , especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more .

Thank you to the instructors and the university ! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader ( institutional and cultural ) framework in which they are produced . I would have rated it 4 . 5 starts if possible , but as halves are not possible I give it 4 . Possible improvements : - the delivery of the course can be a bit livier , smoother ; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format - while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this , sometimes simply mentioning ' lists ' of directors , movies , series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming , hard to relate to - students ' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments####[['instructors', 'Thank you'], ['course', 'very interesting'], ['course', 'rated it 4'], ['instructors', 'seem a bit at unease with this format'], ['course', 'bit livier , smoother'], ['assignments', 'NULL']]

Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about . Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam , its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind . Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic . Some questions on quizzes weren ' t explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week .

This course was truly an excellent way to learn about Einstein ' s Special Theory of Relativity . The content covered most of the main aspects of Special Relativity , and the instructor did a top notch job of explaining how the various aspects of the theory are derived and many implications of the Theory . The maths involved in this course is no more than high - school level algebra with a few tricks , and as such the course should be within most people ' s reach with a bit of effort . Mind you , the concepts themselves are somewhat counter - intuitive , so be prepared to think a lot about the implications . However , all that being said , I highly recommend this course !

We are getting basic ideas , but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly , with NO examples / limited examples , which is what will teach us the most . Then , we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and it ' s very difficult .

I am Jun Qi , a Ph . D . student in the department of Electrical Engineering at University of Washington . I ever took Carlo ' s excellent machine learning courses at UW and was really feeling pretty good .

This course is absolutely awesome ! During 4 weeks I realized that there ' s no such fun as making games in the world ! Also with the help of modern tools ( like Unity game engine ) it is very easy even for the beginners .

I entered this course with no coding experience , and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it . The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R , and the projects are a great playground of R ' s different capabilities , but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures . That being said , this course ' s difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming . Overall , I do not enjoy this course - mainly because it is very difficult . However , the course is structured logically and provides ( what I assume the majority of students ) a comprehensive introduction to R .####[['lectures', 'great explanations'], ['projects', 'great playground'], ['projects', 'too difficult to approach using just the lectures'], ['course', 'opportunity to learn how to ask questions'], ['course', 'not enjoy'], ['course', 'very difficult'], ['course', 'structured logically'], ['course', 'comprehensive introduction to R']]
Great course to explain the fundamentals of Project Finance summarizing key concepts and including some brief examples . Professor Gatti is clearly knowledgeable about the topic and takes great care of being both accurate and synthetic . Course syllabus is also well structured to progressively build an understanding of PF .

Great course . Lot of complicated detail segmented and described in a way that was easy to digest . Thoughts for improvement are with the first few segments . The lessons didn ' t start with the " why " . Why machine learning is used or what problem it solved . I had to google that in order to understand before the course which started with " what " it was . the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe . It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works it ' s clear they did not care to adapt to a 5 week course ) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done . further to the course timeframe ) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions , which is very strange in a course for coaching .

The information in the course was really excellent and was set up in a way that it wasn ' t overwhelming . I wish I could give four and a half only because some of the videos explaining procedures were really long and were obsolete , and also because different parts of the site would say that I needed to submit something and others would say that everything was received so it made me really nervous - at one point the site was telling me that I was late in submitted my work and that I ' d need to sign up for a later class but it turns out my assignments had been submitted and graded before the cut off time so that alert just really frazzled me if anything .####[['course', 'really excellent'], ['course', "wasn ' t overwhelming"], ['videos', 'explaining procedures were really long'], ['videos', 'obsolete'], ['NULL', 'made me really nervous']]

This is a fantastic course ! While the content is reasonably technical , it is taught in such a way as to make it accessible to a wide audience . The Teaching is top notch and the material is communicated in a way that is not only engaging but concise and easy to follow . I have already implemented some of the leanings from this course in my work as a geologist which has led to some significant improvements and findings . I would highly recommend this course to ! it ' s a good course , helps a lot to understand things about pronunciation and helps you to feel more comfortable when speaking in english . The only problem that i find whit this course isn ' t about the course it ' s about the peer to peer grading , is hard to be objective with a big variety of accents and pretty hard to grade sometimes , not in all cases .

Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures .

The course provides a sizeable amount of pretty cohesive material , which can still be understood by non - CS students . It ' s very practical and it includes a very nice mix of quiz tests and great MATLAB / Octave programming assignments . After going through the assignments I started wondering about other problems which data sets I can plug with small modifications into the completed solutions . Andrew Ng keeps a great balance between explaining important details and skipping over parts that require straying too much from the main topic of the lecture . I still don ' t have very deep or broad knowledge in the Machine Learning domain , but it feels like the course doesn ' t miss anything of the fundamentals .

Dog Emotion and Cognition is a clear , well - structured course with some wonderful ' added extras ' that really help round out the MOOC experience . Dr Hare ' s enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and the material presented is more wide - ranging than I had anticipated - - again , adding to the experience . I have learned a fair amount about my dog , which has been fascinating , but have also learned about dog cognition against a wider species - comparative context , which has strengthened my understanding considerably . A superb course ( and the accompanying book , The Genius of Dogs , and citizen science website , Dognition , are wonderful too ) .

Nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering . The playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome . Outside of the necessary downloads , recordings , playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear . Position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the Instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvise .

I would give this course a 4 . 5 if I could . I liked the course overall , but felt that there could have been more explanations with the answers to the weekly projects .

This is a great course that is very informative . It brought many performers to my attention that I had not heard of before or that I had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music . The course focuses mainly on the history and development of rock music , rather than the technical side of the music itself . It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music , but does not feature the music itself .

The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice . There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with , yet this is a pivotal point in education . The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour ( as an external factor ) Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of : Education is to lift man up from the animal state ; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world ( internal factor ) .

I would advise anyone doing this specialization , to take the Java for Android first , then do the Engineering Maintainable Android apps , as its only in the Engineering Maintainable Android apps that there is an optional coursework to create and test a very simple app for the first time .

I was able to complete these courseworks but I didnt really understand all the surrounding code that did a lot of important UI stuff , or the JUnit test .

The course is definitely high - quality and the topics are covered in a good way . I ' m not giving 5 stars because I would have expected SVMs and neural networks .

Week 3 application assignment is buggy . If you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect . You must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for . It ' s a badly designed assignment that wastes students ' time and creates a lot of frustration . Would not recommend the course because of it .####[['application assignment', 'buggy'], ['assignment', 'badly designed'], ['assignment', 'creates a lot of frustration'], ['course', 'not recommend'], ['assignment', "wastes students ' time"]]
Great course for anyone who is new to computer programming and wants to learn Python . This course covers Python 2 . XX version which is good . For folks who already know other programming languages ; you might want to consider other advanced Python courses or opt for advanced Python courses by Prof . Severance . Great Teacher####[['course', 'Great'], ['course', 'good'], ['Prof . Severance', 'Great']]
This course was great . It is obvious that it was carefully planned and laid out . The visiting scholars were a great opportunity to not only learn about historical fiction and what kind of research is done , it ' s also was a great way to learn the process of writing . The necessary text that ought to have been taught was given carefully , without suffocating the student . It was fun and knowledgeable class . I would recommend this class highly to anyone who is really interested in literature and fiction !####[['course', 'great'], ['course', 'carefully planned and laid out'], ['course', 'visiting scholars were a great opportunity'], ['course', 'great way to learn'], ['course', 'fun and knowledgeable'], ['course', 'recommend this class highly'], ['course', 'necessary text that ought to have been taught was given carefully']]
Very dynamic and didactic . The way Dr . BArbara Oakley and Dr . Sejnowsky developed this important course for us students also applies many interesting ways of understanding in a more natural way as well as clear explanation of the methods on how to get a better approach when we are trying to learn something . Its a universal course every student should take to start a very successful career .####[['course', 'Very dynamic and didactic'], ['Dr . BArbara Oakley and Dr .

I DON ' T recommend this course AT ALL . This college doesn ' t spend much effort to structure this course - just putting short videos ( less than 10mins in total per a week ) and external references ( which someone else wrote ) . The assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other . I haven ' t learn anything from this course . It ' s just a waste of time and money . Coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this MOOC platform - I love the other courses / specializations provided by other universities though , A very wonderful introduction to Machine Learning . This course will get you familiarized with some of the best ML techniques , concepts and best practices . If you need to apply ML in your field or want to build your career as a Data Scientist , this is your gateway . This course will leave you equipped and confident to get into the amazing world of Machine Learning . Professor Ng and his team has truly created a gem . I wish they would create and release the Deep Learning course , which delves into further models and topics currently very hot in the world of ML .####[['course', "DON ' T recommend"], ['videos', 'short'], ['assignments', 'just open discussion among students'], ['NULL', 'evaluate with each other'], ['course', "haven ' t learn anything"], ['course', 'just a waste of time and money'], ['course', "doesn ' t spend much effort to structure"]]
Thanks for providing us this opportunity . It was a very nice course . There are few things which might help improve the course : - For a four - weeks course , I feel the material was not enough . I feel there is room to add more items like the use of hyphens , colons , and determiners . Thanks again .####[['course', 'very nice'], ['material', 'not enough'], ['course', 'Thanks']]
Absolutely a great course ! It was a bit strong on the advertising in the beginning but after the first few lectures this significantly decreased . Dr Hare is one of the leading researchers in dog cognition , and he also goes into a the cognition of a number of other animals . It was a very interesting course and I highly recommend it .####[['course', 'Absolutely a great'], ['Dr Hare', 'one of the leading researchers'], ['course', 'very interesting'], ['course', 'highly recommend']]

The best course that I have ever had on Coursera . It goes along with a great pace , and sessions are not too long to lose you to distraction . Each session includes good amount of information which I think they are all useful for someone in the field . All in all , the course is designed perfectly .

This is THE BEST course I have ever taken on coursera or else . Very simple but effective , complex things are made bit simple to learn . Just in 3 weeks , covered a good contents .

Great class ! The course and the problem sets are both very interesting and reasonably challenging . My only suggestion is that a few of the problems are difficult to understand . If those questions can be described in more plain English , students can solve the problems faster . Nevertheless , the discussion forum is very helpful since all of my questions have been asked and answered .####[['course', 'Great'], ['problem sets', 'very interesting'], ['problem sets', 'reasonably challenging'], ['problem sets', 'difficult to understand'], ['discussion forum', 'very helpful']]
I think the textbook does a great job of explaining things very well . I did not watch any videos so can not comment on them as supplements to the textbook . However , after taking this course , I do feel like I have a good foundation for learning Python and code in general . My only criticism is that the course still uses an older version of Python which has some differences and can make the learning frustrating if you are not aware of those differences . Granted , with a free textbook for an older version this is a minor issue thus far in the series .####[['textbook', 'explaining things very well'], ['course', 'good foundation'], ['course', 'still uses an older version'], ['course', 'make the learning frustrating']]
This course was very real , current and useful in my life . The content was well structured & delivered exceptionally well . I liked the fact that it was both theoretically robust and practically inclined , the examples utilised where relatable and easy to follow . I also appreciated the passion is the delivery of the course by the lecturer , her enthusiasm made watching all the videos worthwhile . Thank you for this introduction - it made a significant difference in my life the knowledge touch here is really good . however , the speed is a little bit quick . I paused and go back and forth usually . the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear . I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest .####[['course', 'very real'], ['course', 'current'], ['course', 'useful'], ['content', 'well structured'], ['content', 'delivered exceptionally well'], ['course', 'both theoretically robust and practically inclined'], ['course', 'examples utilised where relatable'], ['course', 'easy to follow'], ['lecturer', 'appreciated the passion is the delivery'], ['lecturer', 'enthusiasm made watching all the videos worthwhile']]
This is one of the best courses in Coursera . This changes the way you study about a subject regardless of the field that you want to specialise in . Education psychology is one of the key things that helps you teach children how to learn . I believe if you know how to learn , you can learn anything ! . Must take . . I am taking this for the second time in the same year .####[['courses', 'Must take'], ['courses', 'one of the best']]
I really enjoyed this course . Barbara Oakley was brilliant and explains things very clearly . Dr . Terrence Sejnowski , however , was incredibly difficult to listen to .

It is just turning out to be a tremendous experience . Robert Schiller , or Bob Schole ( as carl Icaahn calls him ) is one heck of a personality ! the man holds a sea of depth knowledge and history in him . I ' m barely half way through the course but it is just unbelievably informative , and has the right balance of knowledge , explanation , my favorite thing psychology , and the guest speaker every week is the cherry on top !####[['course', 'tremendous experience'], ['Robert Schiller , or Bob Schole', 'one heck of a personality'], ['Robert Schiller , or Bob Schole', 'holds a sea of depth knowledge and history'], ['course', 'just unbelievably informative'], ['course', 'right balance of knowledge , explanation'], ['guest speaker', 'cherry on top']]
This is an intro - level ML course that is very basic yet very useful . Andrew Ng is not only a great researcher , he also has outstanding teaching skills . He is an excellent educator who knows how to explain complex material in an easy way . Overall : A for the course and A + for its instructor Andrew Ng .####[['ML course', 'very basic'], ['ML course', 'very useful'], ['Andrew Ng', 'outstanding teaching skills'], ['Andrew Ng', 'excellent educator'], ['Andrew Ng', 'explain complex material in an easy way'], ['Andrew Ng', 'NULL'], ['Andrew Ng', 'A +'], ['ML course', 'Overall : A']]
In my opinion , Andrew Ng excels in teaching this course . He is able to keep you interested on the course by letting you know what are the most important things you need to carry on from each session . The content of the course is really good , videos , transcripts , slides , etc . Actually , several sites now suggest taking this course before moving into a more deep level of M .

Very good hands - on approach to practical machine learning . However , as the models get more complicated , some of the material isn ' t really explained very well , specially the last module about ' deep learning ' is quite superfluous . I also wish , the course favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition over just graphlab usage . All things aside , if you are really curious about machine learning you should take this course . Be hungry !####[['course', 'Very good hands - on approach'], ['material', "isn ' t really explained very well"], ['material', 'quite superfluous'], ['course', 'favored providing a bit more mathematical intuition'], ['course', 'should take']]
Great subject and some very well presented videos . However there were several which were incomprehensible . Either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a non - American viewer . One doesn ' t always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate . If all the videos had been of good listenable quality I would have given the course 5 stars####[['videos', 'very well presented'], ['videos', 'incomprehensible'], ['speaker', 'very heavy accent'], ['course', 'NULL']]
