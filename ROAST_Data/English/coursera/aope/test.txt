Firstly Peter Clarke , what a legend ! ! thanks for all the help particularly through week 2 . I owe you a virtual beer . One change would be to make the forums the same format as course 1 - 3 as this was a much more efficient way to review issues .

I just finished the course and I want to say it is pretty details and covers a huge variety of topics in machine learning . The problems I had with this course is specifically with the quizzes and programming assignments ; I would get stuck with no idea of what the correct way is to solve it , what I ' m doing wrong , or sometimes I don ' t even know what the question wants me to do .

Thank you for the course ! It was challenging in some way and VERY interesting . Besides , it is really stimulating in terms of self - learning as some aspects are mentioned but briefly .

In this course , I see the future of education . It is light years ahead of any other course I ' ve taken on Cousera or EdX , as the instructor has developed a web pedagogy that gives the course the feel of seminar - based instruction at a top - tier brick and mortar institution of higher education .

A bit of a mess . If you are going in expecting to learn nuances of creating effective wireframes and mockups , you will be disappointed .

When the course started it was very interesting . I really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works . Barbara Oakly was great .

This was by far the best class I have had so far on Coursera . I feel that I now have a really good understanding of linear and logistic regression and neural networks as well as the other learning methods that we touched upon . I thought that the quizzes and assignments were very appropriate and helped me to further cement my understanding that I gained through watching the video .

The course is great for advanced beginners looking for a refresher in html / css and fully dives into JavaScript . If you are not familiar with JavaScript , I would suggest supplementing this course with another JS course or book because the course moves quickly through concepts most programmers have a hard time mastering . Still if you are a total noob , you should take the course anyway , as the projects emphasis use of form validation and object - oriented programming in JavaScript which is important for any new web developer . Due to the lack of support from the instructor and aides in terms of technical issues , grading , and discussion board input , I gave the course a 3 out of 5 . My understanding is that Coursera is working with the instructor to take care of these issues though .####[['course', 'great'], ['instructor', 'lack of support'], ['grading', 'lack of support'], ['course', '3 out of 5'], ['Coursera', 'NULL'], ['course', 'moves quickly through concepts'], ['discussion board', 'lack of support']]
Content is great and would highly recommendThe structure for grading however is poor . The peer assignments don ' t work well compared to other Coursera courses . I submitted my assignments in time , but even after a month I still don ' t have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the ' completion ' of my course . When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses ? !

This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project . I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on .

By the end of the course , you do start to develop the " hacker mentality " the course writers want you to develop . That being said , it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non - programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers . A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics , but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums . If these really are " core concepts " , as described by the mentors , one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases ( which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources ) . It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners , given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics , tons of time on fairly advanced topics , and almost no time on critical intermediate - level content .####[['video', 'given non - programmers a better starting point'], ['video', 'ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos'], ['video', 'jumps into some very advanced topics'], ['mentors', 'no concept of what is critical content for beginners']]

Excellent course . Andrew Ng provides valuable instruction on the intuition and implementation of machine learning algorithms . Even better , he gives lot of advise on how to create effective and performant machine learning systems like accuracy metrics and troubleshooting techniques . The main drawback about this material , for me , is that machine learning has evolved since this course ' s inception . While these are excellent foundations , I wish there was almost a part two for more state of the art material , especially deep learning and an expansion of neural networks . This is just the beginning and it was a great place to start .####[['course', 'Excellent'], ['Andrew Ng', 'valuable instruction'], ['Andrew Ng', 'gives lot of advise'], ['material', 'excellent foundations'], ['course', 'great place to start']]
Short lectures , good notes , and the assignments and quiz ensure you understand the material very well . Although it was more difficult than part 1 , I still found everything very easy to digest and understand . Would definitely recommend to beginners or someone looking to learn programming in Python . For a more in depth general understanding of Computer Science , Take CS50 on EDX . That course is very challenging . I ' m taking both at the same time and although different languages ( C and Python ) , they serve as a nice counter balance .####[['lectures', 'Short'], ['notes', 'good'], ['assignments and quiz', 'ensure you understand the material very well'], ['assignments and quiz', 'more difficult than part 1'], ['Python', 'still found everything very easy to digest and understand'], ['Python', 'definitely recommend'], ['Python', 'very challenging']]
Unfortunately this course consists of the Professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics . The quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data . There does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone . I was committed to working with the course but by week 4 it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help . I ' m sure there is room for improvement on this course and I hope the instructor does work to improve with the course , but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience .####[['Professor', 'reading his notes very quickly'], ['Professor', 'very little time spent explaining complex topics'], ['quizzes', 'emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis'], ['Professor', 'not seem to be anyone monitoring'], ['forum', 'not answered or replied to by anyone'], ['quizzes', 'mistakes in quiz questions'], ['course', 'unfortunately impossible to absorb'], ['Professor', 'no way to interact with anyone to get help'], ['course', 'disappointing as a learning experience']]

I am halfway through the course and while the course is able to give good intuitions of what ' s going on at any one point in time it often lacks dept . The real reason I ' m rating it 3 / 5 , though , is that the mathematical notation is all over the place . You will find a matrix product such as A * B ' only to go on and implement A ' * B . This is SO confusing . I would still recommend this course , but you should definitely record every single lesson again without mistakes and fix those errors .####[['course', 'give good intuitions'], ['course', 'rating it 3 / 5'], ['course', 'SO confusing'], ['course', 'mathematical notation is all over the place'], ['course', 'still recommend']]
Im really fascinated with this course . By the way , i think some quiz have few mistakes as the module about pricing swaptions in the calibration model .

Interesting course with new outlook and perspective on writing . However , I did find it rather brief and not much interaction going on within the forums . People had to wait a long time for feedback and I also thought that those who had paid for the first of the 5 sections , should not be obliged to pay for the next four if they wanted at least to access the material , without being graded .

It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors . The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience . Other than swirl , it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before .

This is not a course about concurrency with Scala ; it has very basic coverage of threads and synchronization towards the beginning , and that ' s it . This is about parallelism , specifically about approaches to program design with the goal of leveraging parallelism .

Strategic implementation , something that people generally forget about after creating their " marvellous " strategies and then watch them fail . This course teaches us how not to make that mistake . The course was nicely organised , though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking .

The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive . There are many examples in it , but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process . The high level process proposed is good , but it is into the details where the processes fails , and there are no detailed examples here . By far , the worst thing related to this course is the peer review . they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined . I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money .####[['course', 'interesting'], ['course', 'quite repetitive'], ['course', 'high level examples which are not really going into the details'], ['course', 'no detailed examples here'], ['peer review', 'worst thing'], ['scoring system', 'subjective and badly defined'], ['course', 'waist of money'], ['course', 'really regret my decision to join this specialization']]

I am only on Week 3 of this course and so far I am thoroughly enjoying it . The videos are informative and well put together . Very interesting to learn about the history of the internet and how it has evolved .

A solid course that delivers what it promises - - the foundations of everyday leadership . As someone who is in their 10th year of leading an organization , I took this class as part of the specialization because I want to make certain I ' m keeping my skills fresh . This course was fun for me , as I recognize many of the things I do every day in it . And I also gained some new skills and insights . I recommend this course for any one who is hoping to move into a leadership position , and for current leaders who are looking for a refresher .####[['course', 'delivers what it promises'], ['course', 'fun'], ['course', 'recommend'], ['course', 'also gained some new skills and insights']]

I really enjoyed this course overall ( and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already ) , but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments . It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors / teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues , especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people . But , I enjoyed the illustrations ( drawings ) and cute examples , and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera . I would probably give this course a 4 . 5 if possible , but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues . Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study .####[['course', 'really enjoyed'], ['assignments', 'technical issues'], ['teaching assistants', 'answer questions or deal with these technical issues'], ['illustrations', 'enjoyed'], ['illustrations', 'cute examples'], ['lecturer', 'pretty good job'], ['course', 'hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues'], ['course', 'recommend']]
Not a very good course . The assignments are not very clear . Could have done much more like integrating front - end etc in place of that loopback module . Was really disappointed with this one .

Really interesting thesis about the impetus behind the formation of the Hebrew Bible . Makes a convincing case by linking the historical , geographical , archaeological , and textual evidence .

The lectures are a very brief overview of topics , with nothing actually taught . The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages .

Despite all the bad reviews this course got I told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career I m not interested in a certificate . So I went through all the open sites which were extremely disappointing . Since I was warned by the reviews , I was not even tempted to pay to unlock further pages .

Although much of the content seems common sense it is probably necessary to build a common foundation here for later courses . The peer assessments are potentially interesting but , in practice , the majority are so trivial - - 3 or 4 sentences repeating back material from the lectures - - as to be hardly worth reading . Since there is no real qualitative assessment in the peer grading , the work put in by a minority is not acknowledged nor the shortcomings of many highlighted . The instructor is unbelievably upbeat and animated which some will love and others . not . I tend to be in the latter camp but recognise this may be due to cultural differences or simply that I ' m a boring old sod !####[['peer assessments', 'potentially interesting'], ['peer assessments', 'majority are so trivial'], ['material', '3 or 4 sentences repeating'], ['material', 'hardly worth reading'], ['grading', 'no real qualitative assessment'], ['instructor', 'unbelievably upbeat and animated'], ['courses', 'boring old sod']]
I give 5 star for the teacher , really approach having such a well - organized teaching material . I also give - 1 star for the homework assignment and its ( almost ) GraphLab only approach . Yes , it mentioned " alternative " approach ( which is much more popular than GraphLab ) , but there are many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through . With scikit - learn as a great open source package , the only reason ( I suspect ) to choose GraphLab is commercial purpose . For me , if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into Pandas , I can finish each programming assignment within 1 hour for sure using scikit learn ; but now , it takes 30 minutes and I still cannot load the data correctly . I like to get a certificate , but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time .####[['teacher', '5 star'], ['material', 'such a well - organized'], ['homework assignment', 'give - 1 star'], ['homework assignment', 'many bugs & trivial difficulties to get it through'], ['homework assignment', 'not necessary and spending too much time']]

Great course , I learned a lot ! Just one thing I ' d like to see more clearly is that , during the course , all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by 12 .

I enjoyed the course and it is quite light for project finance and I would think that this should act as an intro course for a second more complex course dealing with the actual complexities of project finance .

I would also think that more time should be allocated to project bonds and use of derivative structures on securing cash flows and working ratios to support competitive financing and projects .

A five - week class on biological mechanisms of perception of speech and music by humans . The topics include sound signals and sound stimuli and their perception with the human auditory system , differences and likelihood in the perception of vocalization and vocal tones in speech and of music , biological interpretation of scales , and the impact of cultural differences onto music .

There are very long locally - hosted readings ( so they ' re hard to print and you can ' t add them to an offline reader app ) , and the Reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography ( rather than actual reading assignments ) , because there are no links and some refer to " Selections " without giving page numbers or , in at least one case , a multi - volume book .

Solid course . My only complaint is misnomer that you have to know little math / logic . Game theory is a math - heavy subject , and while they do not delve too deep into advanced math , a lot of formulas are used with discrete math symbols ( from set theory , probability ) . It is quite possible to make it through this course without fully understanding these formulas , but it did make a fair amount of the lecture videos confusing to watch . Otherwise than that , the instructors are humorous and obviously understand and like what they are teaching .

This course wasn ' t good . Many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written , and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them . The assignments also weren ' t very deep or imaginative , and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts . The design principles were introduced at such a surface level as to be just silly rather than useful .

I ' ve completed numerous MOOCs but this teacher is simply the best . Very passionate and explains things extremely well . All the lectures look extremely thought out , topics are presented in somewhat funny , but really professional way , quizes are sometimes challenging , but that ' s great ! . If you struggle with Calculus , you should definitely take this course . But it ' s also great for people that like Math in general - I ' ve passed my Calculus stuff long ago , but wanted to recover that knowledge to enter different programming areas and that was one of the best thing I did last year .

A truly fantastic course . Extremely useful , practical , relevant content and examples , plus such a great teacher as well as very helpful course staff and other students . Thanks Andrew , team and the rest of the students . For anyone considering doing the course , note that the time requirements can be a lot - the lectures are fine but two or three of the assignments took far more than 3 hours ( if you plan on actually battling through the coding this is relevant .

I ' ve tried the Python course of Rice university , and some part of the Codecademy Python course ! This is much more basic and offer a fundamental view about all programming language not only just python . Compared to the Rice University course , this one is more for a new beginner who hasn ' t done any coding before . The Rice course doesn ' t really need any coding exp , but with the projects get more complicated in the end , it would be much easier if you have somewhat coding exp before , at least in my opinion .

The tutorials and exercises are quick walk - throughs that can be completed in 10 - 15 minutes each .

The course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the Paris Agreement , progress of renewable energy and EU emissions mitigation , says absolutely nothing about climate science .

The content was really neat and definitely not something I had been exposed to before . I really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on that .

Dr . Impey is skilled at covering a very broad range of topics and sciences that are all a part of " astronomy " . The slides were clear . The transcripts helped to reinforce the information , although probably done with vocalization software as there are many sentence fragments , homonyms for the actual word , etc .

There is absolutely no supervision on this course . My essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now - so , no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as ' late submission ' . I have reviewed 7 papers ( requirement of 3 ) and am shown as being deficient . It is as if I dropped into a void . I paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution , questions or help .

I enjoyed the contents and homeworks . Overall the delivery was very good , and I have grasped a lot . The main reason that I won ' t give 5 stars is the program assignment .

Professor has a soft , easy to follow teaching style but the course structure has several pitfalls : It gets too theoretical in week 3 and 4 and you really don ' t need complex algebra or statistics to pass the course but it ' d be hard to understand the core matters without them . Week 4 ' s assignment is only a quiz and I think there should have been a project to really test student ' s ability to apply the learned materials in real situations . Besides , you don ' t need programming skill to complete the assignments , but it takes a lot of time to learn free , ready - made datavis tools and they are too limited to deliver the outcomes we want . I think if anyone is serious about learning data visualization , you can ' t get away with not knowing programming and statistics and those two should be prerequisites .####[['Professor', 'soft , easy to follow teaching style'], ['course', 'structure has several pitfalls'], ['course', 'too theoretical in week 3 and 4'], ['assignment', 'only a quiz'], ['course', 'hard to understand the core matters'], ['assignment', 'takes a lot of time to learn free']]

It ' s a good course and the contents are very helpful . There are important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation . However I somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion . Take another example , " What is Love " session clearly depends an individual ' s own view . It contradicts " triangular theory of love " and the lecturer doesn ' t even explain why .####[['course', 'good'], ['contents', 'very helpful'], ['contents', 'important components like negativity bias and loving - kindness meditation'], ['contents', 'goes on with a free and open discussion'], ['lecturer', "doesn ' t even explain why"]]

Definitely a " must - take " course . Machne Learning is an important tool for a variety of branches of science and engineering and Andrew Ng has a great way of turning complicated techniques into easy - to - understand pieces .

Feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful , when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesn ' t place any emphasis into it .

Could be better . The teacher sometimes explain the concepts in a hard way , and not always shows how to do in practice . But you will get curious and in case of doubts , you can find more simple explanations on the web , and the forum is very good .

Suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a stand - alone course . For example , there are things that the quiz questions refer to that haven ' t been covered in the course , but you can ' t even look them up because they haven ' t given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google . This means that you ' ll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something else . I have now started using Lynda instead , and am seeing all the bad habits I ' ve picked up and the holes left in my knowledge .

I have a Masters degree and until I took this MOOC I had somehow gotten used to the ridiculous notion that I had learned everything that I needed to know . I am pleasantly amazed at how much I still don ' t know and I am very excited to learn more . I have even started reading journal articles by Page and Zellner because I am very facinated by the models shown to me in this course .

This was a great course for beginners who are looking to get into static website design as a starting point . I had taken this course first out of the ruby on rails specialty courses , and decided to enroll in the entire course .

The assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms step - by - step . The subtitles / transcripts are a disappointment : ( . Full of mistakes .

Very good course for anyone who has struggled to understand how to program , especially in a self - directed / self - motivated way . This course taught by Dr . Chuck was broken down into concise simple sections that kept me interested , and I could follow along easily , with just the right amount of complexity in the quizzes and chapter exercises , so as not to discourage me . I ' ve tried to learn computer programming using Java ( inside & outside of a tertiary environment ) with very limited success , but switched to learning python because it seemed more intuitive . So while i ' m not a complete " novice " to programming , this course had the " Goldilocks Effect " for me . " Just right " : D####[['course', 'Very good'], ['Dr .

I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week . Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard .

The content and the assignment were of high quality and I really enjoyed the case I had to work on . So overal the course was very good , but negative was that the course was a bit too long I understand Coursera needs to finance the course , so it is better to have a long one and earn a lot of subscription fees .

A very enjoyable , engaging course which touches on the fundamentals of Linguistics . I found the professor , as well as the assistants delightful , and the language informants were also very exciting to have .

This course is a very good introduction to programming in general and covers all the basic concepts that is used in most of the programming languages . The lecturer makes things interesting with a sense of humour .

Fantastic course . Helped me get from zero technical knowledge of machine learning all the way to the point where I feel comfortable implementing and can think through those implementations . The course itself is very math - intensive and gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning , rather than just a code - based approach . I feel like this is useful , but I would not recommend this course to people with no coding experience or people who are uncomfortable with linear algebra ( primarily matrix operations for vectorized implementations of algorithms ) . My only criticism is that the course moved slowly at some points , but I took time off to take the course in several days rather than over a few months . I imagine the reminders and short review of topics that have already been covered would be very useful to people taking the course at the recommended pace .####[['machine learning', 'Fantastic'], ['machine learning', 'very math - intensive'], ['machine learning', 'gives a deep technical understanding of machine learning'], ['machine learning', 'useful'], ['machine learning', 'not recommend'], ['machine learning', 'moved slowly at some points']]
This is a great course . I liked the teaching style which was both competent and conveyed the material in an interesting , never boring way . Even though it is some time back now that I dealt with math during my studies , it was easy to follow the course , because the math required was refreshed when needed and kept to a minimum . It would have been interesting to hear a little more about the inner workings of SVMs , this topic was handled a little too short for my taste .

The course is well structured and quite informative . Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses , this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable .

The scope of the course is interesting , the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine , but the contents and quizzes are very often off - point . A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents .

The course was useful in providing an introduction to the basics of game theory . However it would benefit from a native English proofread and smoother delivery . There were also problems throughout regarding the display of graphics and notes behind the professor , who kept pointing to something other than he was referring to . A couple of math notations were also incorrect , for example " < " when the professor said " less than or equal to " . Overall though , I ' m pleased that I took the course and I learned several important aspects of the topic that will benefit me in future study . excellent course ! they teach you all the terms and sentences you need to know either as a beginner learning Korean or if you ' re planning to travel there .

I hope to be able to take more classes from Duke University .####[['course', 'great class so far'], ['course', 'found the incorporation of real life cognition experiments']]
This is a truly superb course , probably unique in its breadth , depth and realistic , fact - based approach to teaching money and banking . I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials , the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system , the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs ( mostly created from thin air ) . The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained . The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system , the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented . I ' m now eagerly waiting for an updated version of the course , since the recorded lectures are from late 2012 .####[['course', 'truly superb'], ['course', 'probably unique'], ['materials', 'particularly liked'], ['materials', 'very well explained']]
The information in the videos was very interesting and well presented . I feel like I learned a lot . However , the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level , and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures . I understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material , but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme . If others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory , I would not recommend this course .####[['videos', 'very interesting'], ['videos', 'well presented'], ['course', 'learned a lot'], ['quizzes', 'seemed to be of a very different level'], ['material', 'hardly discussed in the lectures'], ['course', 'the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme'], ['course', 'not recommend']]
Pretty good course for the first time java programmer . It covers most of the basic algorithms required to understand by a computer scientist . Really like the idea of place introduction of iterator and comparator within this class . It really boost my understanding of JAVA programming language . Would like to recommend this course to all my classmate . It helps !####[['course', 'Pretty good'], ['course', 'covers most of the basic algorithms'], ['course', 'Really like the idea of place introduction'], ['course', 'really boost my understanding'], ['course', 'like to recommend']]
Fantastic content ! . Prof Maya condenses healthy eating into concrete and simple item sets - 1 . What food items to eat and what to avoid2 .

The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python . That being said , the lectures were absolutely useless . I spent 90 % of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow . The jupyter platform is also very frustrating . For whatever reason , error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments . At one point , I lost all my work because of this error .####[['assignments', 'tough'], ['python', 'really tested your knowledge'], ['lectures', 'absolutely useless']]
This course gives a good overview of GIS . It helps in becoming familiar with ArcGIS software and also teaches a lot of fundamentals that can be generally applied to different GIS products as well . But looking at the expenses of using ArcGIS for commercial purposes , it would have been great had there been some sort of additional , optional demonstrations of other products . . For a small - medium business , ArcGIS doesn ' t seem viable at all .####[['course', 'good overview of GIS'], ['course', 'helps in becoming familiar with ArcGIS software'], ['course', 'also teaches a lot of fundamentals']]

I really enjoyed this honest look at the history of Israel as a country . There ' s some dirty laundry on display , and a lot of interesting issues to think about . If you are curious about Israel ' s short and convoluted history , this is a good place to start your studies . My favourite part was the last debate in week 5 ! It got a bit fiery . . . ) My thanks to everyone who made this course possible .####[['course', 'really enjoyed'], ['course', 'favourite part was the last debate in week 5'], ['course', 'got a bit fiery']]

Lectures are great ! And it would be better if we can see all the code from video , yet in week 1 lecture3 some function been blocked and I am not sure if I do it right by myself . Download code may be an option , yet it is better for us to type code by following the lecture , because downloading makes me lazy , typing code by ourselves is a good way to learn . Thank you so much !####[['Lectures', 'great'], ['NULL', 'some function been blocked']]
Some of this content is glaringly wrong e . g that F Roosevelt ' s freedoms weren ' t seen by him as inalienable rights , that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor ' s approach to freedom that were distinctive from FDr . One can go on and on .####[['content', 'glaringly wrong']]
A good course , giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy , their issues and opportunities . I cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date . It really needs to be re - done . The Paris Agreement wasn ' t mentioned , some of the research is from the early 2000s , many of the lectures are at least 3 years old . This is an area that is changing rapidly , monthly , and this course can ' t really be seen to be current any more . Particularly the politics section in week 8 .####[['course', 'good'], ['course', 'giving a thorough understanding'], ['course', 'cannot rate the course higher'], ['lectures', 'at least 3 years old'], ['course', "can ' t really be seen to be current any more"]]
This course was very useful for me in terms of remebering the Busines and Entrepreneuship concepts . This course is designed in easy and simple way to get knowledge on specific vocabulary . Teachers speak not fast and it is great for those who just starts to learn English for work or passing language exams . Course also have very bright , clear images , definitions and moreover it includes grammar classes . I can definitely advise this course that is led by teachers from Penn Unniversity .####[['course', 'very useful'], ['course', 'designed in easy and simple way'], ['Teachers', 'speak not fast'], ['course', 'also have very bright , clear images , definitions'], ['course', 'definitely advise']]
Great course ! Easy to follow , useful , and very practical . At the same time , if you want to understand deeper why things work the way they do and / or the math behind it , the lectures give you good directions to look further into it . The programming assignments are a bit on the basic side ( in terms of what you have to do vs what they give you ) , but are still great to put these ideas into a practical setting , and the optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth . Really glad I put the time into it . Totally worth it .####[['course', 'Great'], ['course', 'Easy to follow'], ['course', 'useful'], ['course', 'very practical'], ['lectures', 'give you good directions'], ['programming assignments', 'bit on the basic side'], ['programming assignments', 'still great'], ['course', 'optional parts help you explore the applications in more depth'], ['course', 'Really glad'], ['course', 'Totally worth']]
The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes , as they are primarily theory and background . The lectures will not , however , aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments . The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures , the textbook , or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment / quiz . There are so many disparate concepts , that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least , demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R . How to properly import the data , create the file , structure the data , and then perform some analysis . These concepts are introduced throughout the course , but never brought together in one complete project .####[['video lectures', 'help you to pass the quizzes'], ['lectures', 'will not'], ['first programming assignment', 'extremely difficult'], ['first programming assignment', 'very little is done in the lectures'], ['textbook', 'so many disparate concepts'], ['course', 'never brought together in one complete project']]
Great course ! Goes over proper statistical inference and its interpretation from multiple perspectives . The hands - on R exercises are invaluable . Don ' t be scared off by them - you don ' t really need to know R to do them . If you interpret literature from the psychological or medical fields , this is a great resource .####[['course', 'Great'], ['exercises', 'invaluable']]
Great lectures and nicely explained , apart from one lecture ( 6th - maybe it was me , not understanding the topic properly ) . For the future , I suggest to have more " visible " support of the lecturers ; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates . Moreover , and I am speaking subjectivily , I found all topics very simple . To deepen my understand , I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge . Thank you for your effort !####[['lectures', 'Great'], ['lectures', 'nicely explained'], ['lecturers', 'address us directly'], ['lecturers', 'enage us more to interact with the content'], ['NULL', 'topics very simple']]
Professor Ng has layed out this course very well , I ' m impressed at what I was able to learn in a few weeks ! The subject matter was engaging , and even the math was easy to follow with the professor ' s explanations .
