Very interesting and handy . I ' m Spaniard , so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals , and the use of street market for shopping vegetables .

I am so glad to have found this course ! ! I had taken a course on MOS transistor operation during grad school , and never quite felt comfortable with the material , since not much time was spent discussing how the relevant mosfet equations came about . Professor Tsividis ' s discourse is like a breath of fresh air . They are so lucid that I feel I understand the material better now .

I enjoyed this course and recommend it . Prof . Fowler is very didatic and funny , and makes the classes nice to watch . I found some of the exercises a little harder than the content given , and the support is not that perfection yet , but one can find some good help in the foruns if ask in advance ( in my case , I must thank a lot my peers Brian and Richard . . . they were true mentors ) .

Important note : Opt for this course only if you plan to do the entire specialisation . It is developed solely for the specialisation and not as a standalone course . You will not learn much concepts or theories or practice any R programming here . In general this course was basic and good enough to get someone started for specialisation . The video lectures for setting up R , RStudio and Github account were helpful and very basic ( maybe coz I already had an github account ) .####[['course', 'not as a standalone'], ['course', 'developed solely for the specialisation'], ['course', 'not learn much concepts or theories or practice'], ['course', 'basic'], ['course', 'good enough'], ['video lectures', 'helpful'], ['video lectures', 'very basic']]
This is a lousy course . The subject and material could be interesting ; however , the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic ' s cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you ' ve understood the key points of the lectures ! While this course was a timed release ( implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week , it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration ; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students .

Interesting and thought provoking course BUT the peer assignment tasks and evaluation criteria are moving targets that seem to be very hard to hit per my own experience and the discussion forums . Also what if you do not totally agreed with the IDEA that thematic presentation of art is the way that modern art has to be presented . And find themes as more of a way for art institutions to promote their own agendas and longevities . Which again is nothing new in the presentation of art but also can meander away from the artists ' and art works ' intent !####[['course', 'Interesting'], ['course', 'thought provoking'], ['peer assignment tasks', 'very hard to hit'], ['presentation', 'not totally agreed'], ['presentation', 'nothing new']]
Awesome class . It was very accessible and had some great examples . I would have liked to see a little more asked of the students .

This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on - line . Prof . Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners .

Good coverage in a very fast intro to the subject . Definitely take away some things I am able to put into use in my work . I get the feeling this is quite a new course ( compared with the very well established Data Science Specialization ) and does not have the student interaction base yet . I hope this aspect develops - perhaps even with the TAs . For this level course student interaction could be even more valuable than the more hands on data science subjects .

Personally I had trouble with week 2 of the course . I think more details on the types of inputs and outputs with some examples would have been useful .

I signed up for this course because I had read Martin Seligman ' s Learned Optimism and wanted to learn more about positive psychology . I would have liked this class to have gone more in depth in terms of the actual science and research involved ( the studies Dr .

This course was exactly as described , and the way it was laid out mimicked the concept they were trying to teach . The seemingly random interjections on brain chemistry could have , in my opinion , been set up s their own unit , instead of into others , which I found to make it harder to digest . My only other pet peeve were the optional projects at the end . I ' m sure some learners like the term - project - like assignments ( creating pdfs , videos , etc ) , but from a casual standpoint ( ie , I ' m not paying for a certificate for this course ) , I was just relieved to find them to be options - - ones I didn ' t exercise . But overall , those two annoyances would not keep me from taking another course from UC San Diego or the instructors behind the course .####[['course', 'exactly as described'], ['course', 'laid out mimicked the concept'], ['course', 'harder to digest'], ['optional projects', 'pet peeve'], ['instructors', 'NULL']]
The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism : it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today . Being a basic course , it is very easy to follow and finish . Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad . Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing , but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn ' t make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating . The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology , especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily ; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors " spark white " , and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it , which was downright infuriating . It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism , but needs serious improvement .####[['course', 'well thought'], ['course', 'basic'], ['course', 'very easy to follow and finish'], ['Quizzes', 'alternating between very good and very bad'], ['peer grading', "doesn ' t make for a good use"], ['videos', 'made with an indecent knowledge of the technology'], ['videos', 'green screens were used so badly'], ['slides', 'cut away and put back'], ['slides', 'downright infuriating'], ['course', 'very good opening'], ['course', 'needs serious improvement'], ['course', 'masterfully set of lessons']]
The information in this course was valuable , but the assignments were poorly integrated with the course . The types of documents assigned were either not covered or barely covered in the course leaving the students to guess what was expected . For one assignment the provided template left off a section required in the grading criteria . The quizes were also poorly tied to the lecture material and some of the questions were ambiguous . There were several quizes were a single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over .####[['course', 'valuable'], ['assignments', 'poorly integrated'], ['quizes', 'poorly tied to the lecture material'], ['quizes', 'ambiguous'], ['quizes', 'single wrong answer resulted in having to take the quiz over'], ['assignments', 'left off a section required'], ['documents', 'either not covered or barely covered']]

A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course . Many were passed onto " look this up yourself " , which is fine , but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong . The group _ by stuff was especially tricky , as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example , eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns . Other than that , very interesting overall and very neat datasets .

An interesting introduction to epidemiology . I felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained , and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principles . However , from the course description , I expected the course to talk more about concepts ( it covered this a little bit , e . g . the Bradford Hill criteria ) and perhaps the state of modern - day epidemiology than it did ( for example , studies and successes from within the last 10 years ? ) .

Course had good structure , the videos were informative and really encouraging to go and start moving , from simple things like stretching at home or in your office to more sophisticated activites like sports or dance . Actually , I ' ve never thought about activites and moving this way – it could be really anything , even just not sitting counts . The course also encouraged me to rethink some of my activity goals , like reaching 10k steps ( most of the time almost impossible for me ) – every step is good and better than count them is to focus on time spent by the activity . I thought this course will be just fun , you know , everyone knows that sitting too much is bad etc . , but it really worked for me as a motivation to set some goals and get moving .

I am super confident even with just two weeks into the course of coming out as a really skilled developer , and hopefully have a fairly advanced " developer ' s intuition " . Best part is he has worked diligently on the minutest of details and been careful how on - line learning can be difficult .

Excellent course . Would like to see more courses like this regarding machine learning for example - courses not focused on the implementation and tools ( for example I am with strong Java background , have read several AI / ML books , implemented several ML algorithms , including deep learning ( DBNN , SdA , Dropout FFNN ) - but all courses are built around python / octave / R tools which I have no interest right now to learn and it is nearly impossible for me to learn both the implementation tool / language and ML theory in parallel . Therefore I do not search for the course in the specific implementation language , I search for the course that can teach & verify my skills one level higher - and I think the way the examples were done in the quizzes - is the right ( and perfect ) way to do it .

I felt the reviews at the end of each module were too repetitive and unnecessary , and Catherine ' s explanation of the exercises too drawn out - they are simple exercises and I don ' t think they required and explanation other than what was there when you actually completed the exercise .

Before I took this course I took the Stanford Machine Learning course , which I greatly enjoyed . That course allows for the learning of difficult concepts in a way that I found less painful than working through a textbook . In this course there is a lot less video content , and the coding assignments are less interesting . Expect to spend a lot of time understanding the nuances of the code that the instructional team has developed , and be prepared to really pore over the gritty aspects of Octave or MATLAB . If you ' re serious about this course I suggest buying the accompanying book . The slides are not easy to understand without the audio narration , which makes them difficult to review , and unlike the case in the ML course , there are not a lot of readily available open introductions written on the topics .####[['video content', 'lot less'], ['assignments', 'less interesting'], ['slides', 'not easy to understand without the audio narration'], ['review', 'difficult'], ['assignments', 'Expect to spend a lot of time']]
This was a very informative course . It help me realize that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to improve interoperability between EHRs as well as improving communication with the patients and families as well as communication between providers . This will most certainly help me in the work that I ' m involved in right now which is family centered care .

The course was really well presented , taught and clear , and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python , it actually helped me to do some research and learn new material .

The course content is perfect , however the rating system is kind of disappointing .

Second , sometimes I can be busy on weekends thus I want to finish the peer review earlier on Friday , however , there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed , thus I am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on Sundays .

I learned so much from this course ! It was amazing how Dr . Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses , such as evaluation strategy , functional collections , reactive programming , and associativity , to describe the core of Spark in only four units . As someone coming from more of a statistics background , I started this specialization only to learn Spark , so I wasn ' t always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be .

Firstly I would like to thank Mrs Barbara Oakley , to have come up with such a brilliant MOOC and more over giving out for free . I won ' t say I was a good student or a bad student , but I was always a frustrated one . Even after getting a Post Graduate degree from one of the prestigious colleges , I remained frustrated and carried this frustration till date . Your course has helped me over come my frustrations in many ways . Even interviews with various field experts has been enriching and helped me realize that even scholars have made their way through practice and perseverance , that they were not naturally gifted ones but they got themselves trained , in particular or multiple areas that they have mastered .

A really nice , gentle introduction to the basics of the Python language .

Not the greatest Python course in the world . Teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized , technical issues are common , and the discussion forums do not offer much value , as you cannot discuss your code with your peers , and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful .

Instructor is so passionate about the topic , that it is hard Not to do what he is suggesting . I ' ll definitely try to sign in to his other courses . One can tell how much effort was put into making this course . Course setup , lecture length , difficulty level , it was all appropriate . Thank you for very enjoyable , and worth a wile 5 weeks !####[['Instructor', 'so passionate'], ['course', 'all appropriate'], ['course', 'Thank you for very enjoyable']]
This course has amazing information in the lectures , but it is difficult in the video lectures to pick out what bits of information are going to be relevant in the quizzes , you will have to re - take quizzes a number of times , no matter how well you are taking notes . Also the very last section is entirely made of a rushed - maths lesson , and a quiz based on that rushed maths lesson that is VERY difficult . I would highly recommend this for anyone who already knows basic Astronomy Math , and caution anyone who doesn ' t .####[['course', 'amazing information in the lectures'], ['video lectures', 'pick out what bits of information'], ['quizzes', 'no matter how well you are taking notes'], ['course', 'very last section is entirely made of a rushed - maths lesson'], ['quizzes', 'VERY difficult'], ['course', 'highly recommend']]
Awesome . Pure awesome . Great presentation on the theory and all the assignments force you to code solutions from scratch , you ' re not dependent on Graphlab . Very detailed presentation of advanced topics not covered in other superficial introductions to regression . And practical advice from the instructors shows that they are imparting practical real - world advice on running regression .####[['presentation', 'Great'], ['presentation', 'Very detailed'], ['presentation', 'advanced topics not covered'], ['assignments', 'force you to code solutions from scratch'], ['instructors', 'imparting practical real - world advice on running regression'], ['NULL', 'Pure awesome']]

While Professor Kaul ' s enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring , his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments . He often rambles through the material , spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand . When he decides to finally talk about the material , it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion . If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments , this course would not have been nearly as frustrating ; challenging assignments , I agree , are crucial for learning the material well . I just wish I didn ' t have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open - ended questions .####[["Professor Kaul ' s", 'enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring'], ['lectures', 'not entirely helpful come time to face assignments'], ["Professor Kaul ' s", 'NULL'], ['lectures', 'disorganized and confusing fashion'], ['assignments', 'challenging']]
Would have like to jump straight to the material . Although I understand some may need it , the command line course was pretty basic . This course on it ' s own doesn ' t give much . One can get started with Programming with R w o missing too much .####[['course', 'pretty basic'], ['course', "doesn ' t give much"]]
This course very briefly presents large picture concepts of Entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit . I would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall . The quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall . i . e . questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey .####[['Entrepreneurship', 'very briefly presents large picture concepts'], ['Entrepreneurship', 'without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit'], ['quizzes', 'focus more on what was said during the lectures']]
This class ' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course . The teachers , while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields , fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon . I ' m not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren ' t used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them . As someone who was taking this class without that advantage , I was quickly lost among all the jargon , to the point where I just had to stop . I ' m hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background .####[['course', 'very mistaken'], ['teachers', 'very knowledgeable'], ['lectures', 'unnecessary jargon']]
课程设计非常合理有趣！老师讲解的很详细，而且真的特别幽默！！虽然报名了好几个课程，但这是我在cousera上完成的第一个！ Although I ' ve registered in several courses in Coursera , this course is the first and the only ( so far ) course that I have finished ! So much fun and I learned a lot ! Thanks Yakkov !####[['course', 'learned a lot'], ['course', 'So much fun']]
Fantastic course . I ' m not very good at actually completing MOOCs ( something about not having to answer to anyone , I suspect ! ) but the reviewing of classmates ' work was done nicely , enough pressure to mean the assignments actually got done , without requiring an unreasonable amount of time . Douglas is a fantastic teacher and really inspiring ; the course has revitalised my writing in just the way I needed !####[['course', 'Fantastic'], ['Douglas', 'fantastic'], ['Douglas', 'really inspiring'], ['course', 'revitalised my writing'], ['reviewing', 'done nicely'], ['assignments', 'without requiring an unreasonable amount of time']]

Great ! This is a great course to learn the idea of machine learning even I am not a computer science and data science student . It provides a chance for us to study different type of machine learning algorithm . The assignment also gives you a chance to practice these algorithms on some application example . If this course can provide more deeply mathematics algorithm or guideline for future study on learning algorithm , it will be a perfect course !####[['course', 'great'], ['course', 'NULL'], ['assignment', 'chance to practice these algorithms']]
Good course for beginners . In my opinion , its strong point is simplicity ( it does not require much effort and yet allows you to learn something useful , and also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex language after all ) and broad range of topics ( probably gives you all words necessary to survive short trip to China ) . What I didn ' t like in this course is lack of explanation : student is required to memorize entire sentences , but nothing was said about word ordering , personal pronouns and other basic structural features of language . I would also like to have more tests / exercises with feedback , probably some review tests covering previous lessons .####[['course', 'Good'], ['course', 'strong point is simplicity'], ['course', 'allows you to learn something useful'], ['course', 'also makes you think that Chinese is not unbearably complex'], ['course', 'lack of explanation'], ['course', 'required to memorize entire sentences']]
Good course , gave it four rather than five starts because : The discussion boards were too prescriptive which did not lead to any open discussions . The videos referred to course material that was not always there . On the plus side , I found the course material useful and well structured . The personal journal was an essential part of the course and it should be emphasized as such . Without it I would not have learnt as much .####[['course', 'Good'], ['discussion boards', 'too prescriptive'], ['videos', 'referred to course material that was not always there'], ['material', 'useful'], ['material', 'well structured']]
This is an excellent introduction to Chinese language and grammar . I think it could have some introduction to written Chinese because Pinyin is not so common . I struggled with some of the quizzes where written answers were given , even when my answers were correct some quizzes required stops ( . ) others didn ' t . Apart from that it was excellent .####[['Chinese language and grammar', 'excellent introduction'], ['quizzes', 'struggled'], ['Chinese language and grammar', 'NULL'], ['Chinese language and grammar', 'excellent']]
The material in this course is very interesting . I feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms . I am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entry - level manner - it will take some hands - on practice with real datasets to build expertise , understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base . I recommend a decent level of comfort with programming . I completed the Python for Everybody specialization , but still struggled with the programming in this course .####[['material', 'very interesting'], ['course', 'comfortable']]
The lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening . For an institution like the host institution , this is odd . I liked the course , but it was not very well organized . Seems like it was for experienced musicians , eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well . Good Course , badly organized .####[['teacher', 'forum discussions is deafening'], ['course', 'liked'], ['course', 'not very well organized'], ['course', 'Good'], ['course', 'badly organized']]
It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship . It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once . More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well . It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business . Thank you to all the teaching faculty for this great learning experience .####[['NULL', 'extremely intriguing'], ['NULL', 'exciting to learn the program modules'], ['NULL', 'still retain the fun elements'], ['NULL', 'gripping right till the end'], ['NULL', 'fun learning experience'], ['NULL', 'eye opener'], ['teaching faculty', 'Thank you'], ['NULL', 'great learning experience']]
The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting . I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did . I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation .
